04-1034 +++$+++          Could you just say a word about the -- the ditch -- sorry -- the word about the wetland next to a tributary that's separated by a man- made object like a ditch?             Are there many such instances?          It sounds to me like a scientific question. Are there many such instances where there is no transfer of water?          And in those instances, is the presence of water in the wetland anything more than a coincidence?         Insofar as it seeks to serve a purpose of the statute to regulate this.         And where do I look to verify that scientific matter?           No.     I can't find any quantitative assessment.           Fine. Now suppose we take a set, which you think exists as not the null set, of instances where there is no such transfer, which your opponents say is this case.       Now what's the justification for regulating those?       If it's simply flood control because water flows over the top and sits there, I guess you could say the same thing is true of any low depression, and therefore, the presence of water would be just a coincidence.             Now, what's your -- the fact that they're wet doesn't have anything to do with it.                   It's the fact that they're next to a place that floods that has to do with it. Now, what's wrong with what I just said?           Okay, I understand that. Now, what specifically, since I think this is scientific, do I look at to verify what you just said, namely that a wet depression, even if there's no interchange, has a lot to do with flood control that a dry depression wouldn't have?                 That's a scientific statement.          Where do I verify it?           I read them, and I -- I just perhaps wasn't reading them closely enough, but I just can't find the verification directly there.       Well, what am I supposed to do with the case?        I read them quickly.          I don't necessarily pick up everything.              I'll read them again. But if I don't find empirical verification for that statement, what am I supposed to do with this case?       Fine.     And where did the agency, in its many, many proceedings over the course of 35 years, say what you just said, namely that a wetland acts as a sponge?           It's very plausible to me. It's just that there may be a need to drop a citation somewhere. (Laughter.)
04-10566 +++$+++        Have there been courts that have held the contrary?               Have there been courts that said when somebody wasn't notified and they sought to obtain some remedy for that, that even though the treaty has been violated, you have no remedy under our system?       Which are -- which is the best authority abroad for you that -- where they say, no, we're sorry, we give you no remedy, even though we violated the treaty?         That's a holding?        They -- they held that?         So we have a lower court opinion in Canada, and you -- and they have a lower court opinion in Australia.               Is it fair if I come to the conclusion no one has ever really decided this?         All right.        If -- then if that's fair, is it fair also for us to say that -- that we have to take this treaty, since it's self-executing, as if it were written into American law?         Is that fair?         Okay.      If that's fair, then suppose you're coming -- suppose the treaty had said -- and it's part of American law.        It didn't say this, but suppose it had.          You have to inform this individual, and if you don't inform the individual, you have to give him a remedy so that he is not prejudiced thereby. Now, if it had said that and the State or the Federal Government refused to give him a remedy and it's part of American law, wouldn't we have to say that American law, Federal law, treaty law requires you to do that rather than what you're doing, if it had said that?        Okay.        And once we're there, it seems to me what we're arguing about is not this metaphysical thing about rights.                 We're arguing about what the treaty says.           Now, if that's so, I -- I think we're back to where we were in the last case and say does this treaty or does it not, as a matter of American law, say that the person is entitled to some kind of remedy.          And our problem there is that the ICJ has said, yes, it does, but it doesn't mention it, but it does say that you cannot have procedural rights that do not give full effect to the purpose of -- of this section.         So where are we?            Well, the -- the thing is, I found stronger the other way, which you can answer, is that ordinarily, I guess, since they quote in one these amicus briefs, since at least 1927 we consider -- our State Department -- the treaties that have obligations are -- also require appropriate enforcement remedies, et cetera.          And we have Avena and we have LaGrand, and there the ICJ, as I read it, has said you have to have some kind of remedy, being pretty vague about what kind it is.       All right.   So normally we follow the ICJ, if we can.        Schooner Betsy and go back forever. All right.   So why not?        Just follow what they say, say there has to be some kind of remedy.                  And then we put our minds to figuring out what that kind is.           I have a couple --           -- thinking of the wrong thing, but it seemed to me I have a couple of opinions here on habeas, State habeas, where they did raise it. Am I thinking of the other case?           And -- and not on --          So then the -- then the only question really is this thing that I find metaphysical, and maybe you can explain it.                 To start talking about the individual rights that -- enforceable, that sounds to me like a -- you know, a case that arises under 1983 or something.            But I thought we don't need that concept.         We all agree that -- that this -- this is the law of the United States.               It's self-executing.    And the only question is whether the action here violates a provision of the treaty, which is the law of the land. What else is there? And -- and the only thing I read that the ICJ said, it said, by the way, I'll tell you what kind of procedural rule you can't have.                  You can't have a procedural rule that says after you failed to inform him of the right and after he's unbelievably prejudiced, you say he can't raise it because he didn't raise it before he could possibly have found out about the right.          That would be self-defeating.         So you can't have that kind of a rule. Now, do you agree with that?           You explain to me where I -- where I --            I wonder what that means. Suppose that the treaty provides that if the individual sends a letter to the counsel, they have to deliver it. Doesn't it?         Well, suppose a sheriff somewhere grabs the letter, keeps it, and the counsel sues him under State property law.                   And State property law, they say, entitles me, says the counsel, to this letter.        It's mine.     It was sent to me.         Now, if that happens to be the interpretation of the judge in the State of X the sheriff can keep the letter, wouldn't you say that that property law of the State is invalid in light of this provision of the treaty, which is the law of the United States self-executing?         No.     I just would like an answer to my question.         No.     I've given you the straight facts.          The straight facts are they sue -- I don't have to repeat them.               I want to know under -- under my straight facts, wouldn't you say that -- you got the question.           But I'm not saying a treaty. I'm saying there's a letter and wouldn't it be the case that the judge would have to say, here, Mr. Sheriff, you take the letter and you hand it to the counsel?         It's his property.           That's correct.           Okay, fine.           And now what they're doing here is they're saying we have a cause of action.                It's called habeas corpus.              And we're asking for a rule of decision in that cause of action, and the rule of decision in this cause of action, just like mine, was in property.             Is the decision -- the rule of decision is the rule written into the treaty, just like in the property case, and you cannot do anything that contravenes it though, of course, you can argue about the content of that rule of decision.       I imagine there's not -- there's some little authority both ways.               To put it in my perhaps -- I know you disagree with this way of thinking about it.        But I'm -- I'm thinking about this article 36 and thinking that you're reading it as if it said, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can't do anything about it.          And the other way is to read the silence as if it said, inform the individual, but if you don't, he can do something about it.                          We're not saying what.             Okay. Now, between those two interpretations, we have the ICJ picking interpretation two and rejecting interpretation one in, I grant you, a different case. But I guess since a lot of these amicus briefs tell us throughout history, a long history, we've tried to follow ICJ interpretations of treaties to which we are parties.         Why -- it's all up to us, but we've tried to. Why -- why should we not, given the two possible interpretations -- they choose one.                           Why should we not choose to follow theirs here?       Well, then you're going back to putting weight on the absence of authority.                    In those contracting states, most of which I guess are civil system states, and in civil systems, you'll have magistrates who do take this kind of thing into account, but you won't find a case on it.                    So -- so --       -- are there authorities in these other states to the contrary?                    I'm surprised if there is.       Do they, in all those property cases, you know, from like the early part of this republic where property law was determined in accordance with -- you know all those cases that are cited.       In those treaties where the courts then looked to the treaty to help decide who owned what property, they used it as a rule of decision.         Do those cases -- treaties all use the word individually enforceable rights?       Where does this term come from as applied to a rule of decision?                 I mean, when somebody is arguing that the treaty should apply a rule of decision in a case brought under some other cause of action, what's the best thing I could read?                I'm not an expert.       You say the way to think about that --       -- is the, quote, individually enforceable rights.
04-1067 +++$+++            All right.        Well, I -- the words that keep going around in my mind -- it's her house, too, isn't it?           Well, she wants the policeman in.             So, why does he have more of a right to keep the policeman out than she has to have the policeman in?           Right.           Everybody makes some sacrifices.           All right --           -- let's think --            -- of the need for this, because it's the other thing that's on my mind.                       The two words that came into my mind are "spousal abuse." All right?          I would say maybe there's a pretty good need for this.             The husband's beating her up.           And there isn't evidence of that, but she's sitting in the kitchen table, and the neighbors hear something odd, and they call the police.                 "We'd better look into it." They come to the door.               She says, "Um, hmmm, oh, I'd like, Officer, for you to just come upstairs to my bedroom for a minute."                Is there any neighbor, friend, or policeman, in those circumstances, who wouldn't go?            Oh, no.       It's the question of the rule.              I haven't seen anything on your side that would advocate a rule that would not prevent the many, many, many, I believe -- I am not an expert -- ambiguous cases of domestic spousal abuse from being investigated by the policeman.                    And maybe you can tell me you've looked into it empirically and I'm wrong, and that's why I'm bringing it up.          No, no, but -- no, I'm not getting your answer.            Are you telling me that it is the law in Chicago, for example, that if a policeman responds to a call, a call of -- it's ambiguous -- what it says is, "An anonymous caller said there's an odd situation next door.               Will you check out 2355 Maple Street?"            He goes there.        The wife looks a little oddly at him, but they're sitting at the table, and she says, "Officer, I'd like you to come upstairs with me."          The husband says no.          Are you saying that the law is clear in Chicago that the policeman can't do it?          All right.        Where --       -- is it clear that the policeman cannot do it?       Fine.       That's what --       -- I thought it was not clear.        And, therefore, what I'm asking you for is -- if your rule --       -- is the law --       -- there are 200,000 cases a year in Chicago, alone.            I think that there might be many ambiguous cases.          So, you relieve me of my concern that if you win this case, in those ambiguous situations, where the wife wants the policeman in, and she's afraid to tell him why, until she gets him up to the room -- she wants him in -- and he, now under your rule, as far as I can see, could not go in.              And I'm telling you, quite frankly, that's what bothers me a lot.           There aren't exigent circumstances.             In the case I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of what I call "ambiguity," and there are many such cases, I believe, of spousal abuse, where the wife is intimidated.                Now, maybe I'm wrong on my facts, but those are the cases I'm worried about.         -- I think I'd say, "Well, you know, I don't want to have anything to do with this."        If it's a dinner party, forget it.            But if I'm in a situation such as the police might be involved in, where I think there is some danger, there is something wrong in the house, there's something odd about it, I don't think the average person would just say, "I'm going away."             I think the average person either would come in, or he'd say, "I'll come in for a while.        I'm going to call the police," or they're -- you just wouldn't have that reaction, "I want nothing to do with it."           That's the reaction, you know -- that's a bad reaction, when you want nothing to do with a dangerous situation.               So, I think, in that situation, the normal reaction would be, "I'm going in," or, "I'm going to get some help," or, "I'm going to get a friend," or, "I'm going to call the police." So, I don't know you do have expectations of that kind, in those situations, though you might with a dinner party.       But I want you to address the question of how the legal category of "reasonable expectation of privacy" fits in with what I just said, where I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly including, situations of danger where the police might be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you will be left alone.         I want to know how those facts, if they are facts -- and you can say they were not -- fit within the category called "reasonable expectation of privacy."        -- and I thought, was -- there was no one -- no consent there.                   There was nobody giving consent, was there?        Was there?        I'll go back and read it.        I'll reread it. [Laughter.]       Uh-huh.
04-1084 +++$+++          Well, that isn't the compelling interest.          The compelling interest is, we signed a Treaty, and you follow it.          Now, how can you say that the Government wouldn't have a compelling interest in following a Treaty where they -- where they promised to ban the substance?          I mean, they're not -- they're just saying RFRA doesn't apply where that's at stake.                        Now, what's the argument against that?                  You're saying the argument against that is, maybe it really isn't a compelling interest?           Well, okay.         Why not?      I mean, it sounds to me as if it would be.                 They have a Treaty.           They have to live up to their word, period.                      What's wrong with that?         It does?          All right.    That's an issue, I guess.           I'd have to decide: Is a compelling and -- does it require the Government to go further?                       But you concede that if it doesn't require the Government to go further, you lose.         All right.        So, that's a different issue.          Why doesn't it?       I have specific language from the Treaty's commentary in front of me that supports you. Are you not going to read that? [Laughter.]       I don't know if there isn't a factual question here.             I mean, I thought Justice Scalia, if it were to be up to him, did take into account official commentaries to treaties.            But maybe he doesn't.     Anyway, I take them into account.            And I -- and in respect to that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants -- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa root, which contains DMT.         And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera.                      And there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a Treaty.        All right?     Now, the Government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting DMT.              Now, what's the response to that?       But, as -- I understand the Treaty.        What the Treaty says is, you can't import substances listed in Schedule 1.               Then you look at Schedule 1, and it doesn't say hoasca.          It says "DMT."     And then it has another -- and, interpreting that, it says the fact, if you look at that list and it says "DMT," means what it says: You can't import DMT.                It's a drug importation statute, and it doesn't cover plants that contain the substance DMT.            Otherwise, we'd have -- throw out bananas and -- or mimosa, anyway.               And we're not looking to intent on that.         Now, that's a possible interpretation that doesn't contradict anything.                 And --          You're in trouble.     That's harder, then, if it's --        Yes, but --        -- I don't see -- I mean, I see I was not right.          You do import drums of tea.            And they say, in the Treaty, that a preparation is a solution or mixture containing a substance.                And it would seem to be a solution or a mixture containing DMT.                    And the commentary that I thought helped you does concern plants, but you're not importing plants.           So, now I'm rather troubled to see if there is any way that this Treaty is interpreted in a manner that allows you to win.               What is it?
04-1131 +++$+++        All right.        So I guess you re saying, as to the constitutional claim, it s obvious they have to exhaust. There s no reason why they don t have to exhaust in respect to the 12th test, which has already occurred, and in respect to the 15th, which might be threatened, if it does come about that it s threatened, they can go in, I guess, under 705 of the APA and ask for an injunction.        Any reason they couldn t do that?       No, no.       What they do is they follow, like any other agency action.                 An agency action has taken place.           I think it s unconstitutional or you do.          We exhaust our remedies and then get to court at the end of the day and make our claim. An agency action is threatened.                  I am threatened with irreparable injury.                         I can go to court, I think, at the time it s threatened, and say I want a protective order.             I think 705 provides for that specifically.             And -- and, therefore, I m protected.                   I can t imagine why they couldn t do that if they have a -- not just a plausible, but a -- a good claim that it does violate the Constitution and they need the protection.              Is there any reason they couldn t?            No, they wouldn t.         Their point is that the very -- availing myself of the administrative remedy will work irreparable harm of -- in violation of my constitutional right.                        Now, maybe that s not true, but let s imagine it s true.                        Then couldn t they go in and ask for a protective order?                             I thought that you could do that, but I might be wrong.            Yes.     And is there any reason that they shouldn t be able to do that here? Because they are going to say that -- I don t know they ever can make it out in this case, but they are going to say that my having to go ahead with the number -- test number 15, which, by the way, may never be threatened, but if it is, it will, the very fact that I have to do it, violate an important constitutional right that I need to have protected before undergoing the text -- the test.          Yes.          You think they could not do that under 705.          So there is a difference between you on that. As to the statutory claim, I mean, I find -- but others may disagree with this.                  It s my personal view that the notion of private right of action in this area simply mixes things up.                It s apples and oranges. It has nothing to do with anything.                   That if a person, in fact, is adversely affected or aggrieved by a Government action, he usually, almost always, indeed, can get judicial review eventually.                        But what you re saying there I take it is that may be so, but this impliedly says no.             Now, my question is do we have to decide that.             Because, after all, this individual may get relief through the statutory procedures that you admit are provided by asking for grievance arbitration.               He may, the first time he asks for it, be given a piece of paper that shows him he wasn t hurt.             Or he may have been hurt, and they ll say we don t it again.             There are a lot of things that can happen. Do we have to decide the issue today of whether if he goes to the union, the union says we won t arbitrate, or they say we will and they lose and it isn t as an unfair labor practice -- do we have to decide that issue as to whether a person in those circumstances can then subsequently go into court?         So we have to say the easier matter is it s clear that as to such matters, you must exhaust.         It s so clear that there is no reason for us to decide whether there is an implied repeal of the right at the end of some days to -- to judicial review, a matter which is disfavored in the law.         I might.          My -- so I don t know why it wouldn t be.       What their brief says is that they can go on a personnel, as opposed to major personnel, to the OSC if, and only if, the complaint has to do with whistleblowing.       And this doesn t have to do with whistleblowing.       And therefore, even if this were a personnel action, that route to the OSC is not open to them.       Is that true? What do you think?
04-1140 +++$+++         It's hard to have three different kinds of standards with attorneys-fees statutes.          I mean, there are quite a few of them, and -- I can understand saying some of those statutes mean you almost always should get it, because of special policies reflected in the history of the statute, et cetera.              That's Christianson. And I can imagine Fogerty, where you say, "As to an ordinary one, it's ordinary."                "Ordinary" means it's up to the discretion of the district judge.                     And there may be many reasons.              Do we want a third one, where --        -- let's say they pass this -- and it's "unusual"?                I mean, we're going to get several categorizations and shadings of statutes.          I don't have an answer.          I'm not suggesting a point of view on this.                     I'm curious what you think.
04-1144 +++$+++         Well, suppose it were from your point of view. I don't know from the other side's point of view, I guess it would satisfy you to say that this statute can not be enforced in any circumstance in which a physician certifies in good faith that he believes an immediate abortion is necessary for the health of the mother.        All you're looking to is the state of mind of the physician. Now, the problem that I think we would see with that is you would then be writing into the law the broadest possible definition of what that health exception means.          So I'm not sure the New Hampshire legislator would have wanted to do it and I'm not sure the other side would like to do it.                   But looking at it from your point of view, do you have any objection to it?        I don't want you to agree to this unless you've focused on it and think it really is your position.             I take it, as I'm listening, that you would not object to an injunction that says that this statute cannot be applied in any circumstance where a doctor, in good faith, himself or herself, believes that there is a health emergency, period. Now, I take it as soon as we get more narrow than that, you might object on the ground that that will leave ambiguous cases where there really is a health emergency, but the doctor doesn't know what to do and would have to go to court, by which time it will be too late.        Have I stated it correctly? You've focused on it, thought about it, stated it?        Okay.     Thank you.
04-1152 +++$+++        But that isn't --       -- that isn't relevant.       Oh, there are --       -- students --       So, why isn't --       So, in fact, to be clear, you also think schools that are angry at the military because they're too favorable to gays in the military, they have the same right.       Okay.       And also the same right Bob Jones University, because they disapprove of social mixing of the races?       All right, so --       -- so, what -- and there are a lot of people in the country, they may -- there's few, anyway -- may not believe in either affirmative action, they may not believe in -- they may not believe in diversity, they may not -- they may even believe in racial segregation, for all I know.                    I hope there are not too many --       -- but there might, and those people all have the same right.       Yes, okay.          So, if that --       -- if that's the case, then of course it's going to be pretty tough --       -- for the military to get people on campus.         And I just wonder, if that's an important need, why you don't have here what I'd say is normal in the first-amendment area, that the remedy for speech you don't like, is not less speech, it is more speech.            But I would --            -- I would like the answer to my question, because I'm thinking, as you correctly say, if you have that right, so do all the worse segregationists you can imagine, et cetera.       And here -- yes, and here there is a need of some kind to get the military in. And what the Government in this statute asks you -- because I, personally, couldn't find anything in the record that finds that student who thinks, by letting the military person in, that that school, which basically is completely against the military in this area, suddenly becomes for it.               And I haven't even found in the record an instance where there was a recruiter who told people that they couldn't join the military if they were gay.       So, we have not a tremendous demonstration there of a need on the university side. And my question was, What's wrong with the Government saying, "University, you disapprove of what we do.                The remedy for such a situation is not less speech, it is more speech."       Go and explain it.         Do you agree with the Government, that the statute, as fairly interpreted, is violated when a school which uniformly applies to all employers the rule, "You can't come in if you have the discrimination against hiring gay people"?         Well, the speech is on their side.       The Government just says, "Let our recruiters in."      So, why isn't it sort of like, "Pay the property tax"?       "I don't want to.         I hate the government."         -- "I'm withholding the money because I want to express my message."         The message is, "Join the Army."        The --           -- message of the property tax is, "Pay the -- pay for the" --           -- "Government's expenses."
04-1170 +++$+++        No, no.       They're -- they're saying it is appropriate.                They're saying it is appropriate.             We have the people put in the box.          The box is are they in a situation that is different from the average murderer.              Yes.     And they're making the determination that although they're in that box, that morally they're no different.                  Morally they're the same --           -- because for every factor that makes them morally one way, there's a factor that makes them morally the other way.                    So they're different, but they're not morally different. Now, that's -- that's what I think this case presents.           And I -- I mean, I imagine a juror who's thinking just what I said.                 I don't know if there ever was such a juror, but if there was such a juror, the statute in this instant tells him what to do.           It says where you think there is an equivalent, but not a moral difference, death.             That's different from saying not decided.             I thought the Kansas Supreme Court didn't speak of not decided.              I thought it didn't speak in Kleypas about a jury who -- a juror who can't make up its -- his mind.             I thought it said the jury has made -- it assumed the juror has made up his mind.                   That's why I think it's artificial.                    It says where the jury finds.       It finds equipoise as to the mitigating and aggravating circumstance, then death, that the jury has to find that.            That's true I -- I think, isn't it? And then the question is, does a State have a right not to do with burden of proof, not to do with anything else, but to have perhaps the artificial situation where the jury finds that the evidence is in equipoise whoever has the burden of proof.                   Put it all on you, whoever had it.                That was their final conclusion.              I find it is in equipoise. Next question:          what happens?       Oh, I agree with you. That's not the problem.
04-1186 +++$+++         What -- what about if we go back to 1880 or whatever and they had a messenger?                  You know, they only had one office, but they had depositors in different States, and this messenger went from State to State handing out the cash and collecting a fee. Would Congress at that time have considered that bank to be located in all the States where the messenger showed up?        Couldn't have a messenger? He just delivered some mail.               The post office was slow.        The Pony Express.
04-1203 +++$+++           But was there -- there was a reporter who was one of the disabled people, I think, wasn't there, in Tennessee versus Lane?          And so --          -- what is the right that that reporter has that's specific to courthouses?       Well, was there any problem of that in Tennessee versus Lane?                I thought the courthouse officials there said, "There'll be a trial. No problem there, just whether you have to walk up the steps or don't, and we'll give you a trial down below." Was there -- it's the right of access to courthouse, specially?           In your point of view, would it help if the Court said -- I guess it would, but I -- in order to get rid of this problem, if the Court said, "Look, it says 'reasonable.'                  Of course prison has special problems," and, referring, say, to Turner versus Safley, said that, "These things about television remote controls are not really, normally, a matter of unreasonableness."                  So, in other words, we hit -- we -- you'd give considerable discretion to the -- to the warden, and the Act would have bite in cases where there is really a serious problem, like this one. It's alleged to be a really serious problem.           I thought it said "reasonableness."           Well, that's --           This is true.       This is exactly the point I had asked about before.                     This is a better point.             Because I thought that bridge was -- that -- was crossed in Lane.                  That is, I don't see how you can say that Lane was not giving -- saying it's constitutional to have prophylactic rules.                     And that's why I raised the reporter.                 I've never heard of a First Amendment right of a paper to send a particular reporter.          I mean, if there's a disabled reporter who couldn't get into the courtroom, I guess they could send a different reporter.                 Maybe that's a First Amendment right, but I have not heard of it.                     So, I thought that, really, Lane is saying, "You can sweep, within the prophylactic rules, a lot of things that are not, in fact, constitutional violations, but simply discrimination against disabled people."           I think there is a First Amendment right for a newspaper, for example, to send a particular reporter to the courtroom.                  That's an interesting question.          I never thought of that one.           I --       -- you don't think Lane stands for the proposition of their prophylactic rules being perfectly legitimate under the Eleventh Amendment, where you have a set of constitutional violations?       No, I was asking --       I'm --       Yes.           -- "is fine under Title II, given a core of constitutional violations."                       So, how do you distinguish them that?       You mean --       -- beyond a --       -- the average public, you had a constitutional right?               I mean, you might have.    I might be surprised.         But, interesting.       The average person could have brought a lawsuit, a person in a wheelchair, and said, "All the courthouses in this country, or in this county, are on the second floor, and moreover the bathrooms -- I need a special bathroom," and they would have won without the ADA.            Why did we need the ADA, then?       Ah.     Ah, you're saying -- I -- what I just heard was, it's -- the reporter just was a stand-in for the average person, that the average person had these constitutional rights, which may have been a --
04-1244 +++$+++         I'd like you to get to the meaning of the Hobbs Act.        And I'll try to focus my own thoughts on this by saying two objections to what you're arguing, related, that when they passed the Hobbs Act, it had a section 2, and section 2 said that, "This is an Act that forbids robbery and extortion, all involving interstate commerce.          And robbery/extortion involve property."          Then it had a section 5.            And section 5 said, "This Act forbids physical violence or threats of violence related to section 2."             Now, all that happened since then is, there was a recodification.                  And the recodification wasn't meant to change anything substantive. Second and related point: Enmons.             For 35 years, working people in this country have thought they had a right to strike, free of the Hobbs Act.                    And your interpretation, as the AFL-CIO points out, will gut the right to strike. Now, those are two strong arguments against you, and I'd like to hear your response.       When you see something in a criminal statute that forbids "affecting commerce by," that means that Congress wants to prevent the conduct that will follow the words "by," and it needs a jurisdictional hook, so it puts in "affecting commerce."                That's how I've always understood the Federal criminal code.                Am I --       -- wrong in that?       Well, I -- I mean, one is -- I'm attempted to say, "Well, tell Congress that."                  If they want to create a separate offense, they can do it.       But isn't the reasonable reading of that, "violence in the course of achieving -- for the purpose of achieving the object in question," as opposed to, in effect, a "by-blow against a bystander"?       Mr. --       -- I want to give you a chance, because you're quite right in thinking that I'm moved, in large part -- or worried, in large part -- not about this language, but about the change in Federal criminal law. And the change in Federal criminal law, if you're right, way beyond this case, would transform virtually every threat of violence made anywhere in the United States into a serious Federal crime.            At the least, it would -- and make a major change in threats of violence on the picket line.       And those are two aspects of the same thing.         And I'm worried about the upsetting of expectations way outside the context of this case and making a major change in Federal labor law, for example.       What does it -- 1951(c) says what?       Yeah, but I -- then perhaps I -- that's an old statute, 1951(c), isn't it?                  Is it something brand new?       Yeah.       All right.        What is it --       Well, the case that interpreted the Hobbs Act, which is Enmons --       -- seems to rely, for the labor-union exemption, on the fact that a threat of violence in an effort to obtain legitimate wages is not within the Act.           But if we read "legitimate wages" out of the Act, then I guess we would be left with "the threat of violence."         No, the -- it's not a -- that's wrong.        It says "affect commerce."         And, therefore, we have the instance of any threat of violence that affects commerce becomes a Federal crime subject to 20 years of imprisonment.             And, of course, in today's world, as you know, I believe almost everything affects commerce.                    And if I'm even close to being right, this is a major incursion of Federal law, serious criminal Federal law, into what could be fairly minor matters of State criminal law.
04-1264 +++$+++            When I was working on the first options in those cases, I thought there was from Southland a pretty clear distinction between whether the person is attacking the arbitration clause itself. If he says that s not valid, that probably goes to the court, unless there s some other special thing.                     But if what he s doing is attacking the rest of the contract as illegal, that doesn t.                That goes to the arbitrator. Now, I really did think that was the law. And even if I was wrong in thinking that was the law, it seems to me the whole community, the whole business community in the United States thinks it s the law. Everybody else thinks it s the law, and the briefs on your side don t even say that it isn t the law, except for yours.          They say go and overrule the cases that make it the law.        I mean, logically you re right.        I accept all that you re saying logically.           You could make those distinctions, but you also could come out the other way logically.               And so to expose to you what s really bothering me about the case are two things. One, I think you re worried about consumer contracts, and there are a lot of good arguments on your side. But this rule also applies to business contracts, and there what s bothering me is that -- that the whole business community seems to have developed an arbitration system throughout the world that depends upon the distinction I just made.                And if we decide for you, we re going to throw a large section of those contracts back into the laws of the 50 States and arbitration will be seriously injured as the commercial community has come to rely on it. Now, that s what s worrying me because I wouldn t want to reach a decision, in the absence of it being clear anyway, that would make a significant negative difference to the gross national product of the United States, for example.        I m putting it dramatically because I want to get your --       Well, what about --       It s not -- the workability of it depends on how many challenges you get to people saying this contract is void, you know.                And if there are a lot of them, then that takes a whole wide set of cases out of arbitration and puts them into the courts, just where they re trying to escape.                     And -- and so I don t know the answer to how many, to be truthful, and I suspect no one does. So I m wondering if there isn t another route to the problem you re getting at, which is, as I think in other countries, you say there s a doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz.           You know that?            You know what I m thinking of?         It s arbitration generally. They don t even look to see whether people agreed about the arbitration clause.                It says arbitration.          It goes to arbitration regardless. Now, the safeguard is, A, maybe the arbitrator will get it right or, B, if the arbitrator doesn t get it right, they have to come to court to enforce it.           And at that point, you could say, you know, this arbitrator is out to lunch.                     Our cases say he has to be really out to lunch, but you could make some distinctions there, you see.                  And -- and if this is really a problem that arbitrators are upholding illegal contracts, that might be the place to begin to make the distinctions.               Say, Judge, look at this a little more closely where it s illegal, the whole contract, et cetera. What do you think?          I had thought that the interstate commerce question was like Crowell v. Benson.        You know, it s like a constitutional fact. And in fact, if you can t -- if there s not the constitutional -- if there s not the connection with interstate commerce, Congress, at least arguably, would lack the constitutional power to tell the State court what to do in this case.               So it s not as surprising if there is a difference between that kind of fact and the kind of fact that goes to whether the -- the contract is void ab initio.          Yes, it is.       It s both.
04-1324 +++$+++           District judges can't comment on the cases?             And -- they suddenly raise something, curious about something; and, lo and behold, it becomes the subject of an amendment.          That's a violation of -- I mean, what I'm driving at is, I don't really understand Rule 15 thoroughly, because I'm not a trial lawyer.        And why do we have to decide every matter? Why don't we let the District judge free to run his trial and just say, "Hey, we don't want to proliferate law.      It's complicated enough already.              Let's leave it to Rule 15, whatever that might be"?            -- and there would be more for lawyers to look up.                Whereas, if you just say Rule 15, it's finished.        Why, though, would we have a special rule in this respect for habeas cases?                  Same question I've had throughout.               Treat it like any other civil case.        All right, if it's not a special rule, then the answer to this is, just say, "No, you don't have to raise it sua sponte.                Moreover, you cannot raise it sua sponte, except in exceptional circumstances," cite the three cases that said that. And, as far as you're suggesting it to people, you could do it just as much as you do in any other civil case, no special rule.               If they want to move to amend, fine, end of case, we did it in a paragraph.            Well, the same with strike suits.       You know, there are a lot of class-action strike suits and so forth that at least one group of people think are terrible and the other group think are great.             So, you say, "Well, we're going to have a special thing here for amendments in strike suits. Have a special amendment for some" -- you know, why proliferate law?
04-1327 +++$+++         Your point is that we're quibbling with the language.              Certainly the language can't be right.        I mean, Gregory is quoting America -- Am.Jur.        It's totally right.        And I don't -- in my opinion.         I don't see how there's a problem.       It's simply a way to prevent the defendant from confusing the jury with evidence that's not -- doesn't have high probative value.         That's -- so we --            They don't agree with that necessarily, but I'm taking that as a premise.            Now, he describes this, the writer of the opinion, and if I hadn't been guilty of this sin myself, I couldn't criticize others, but he uses language that's absolute.                   He says, where there is strong evidence of an appellant's guilt, especially where there's strong forensic evidence, the proffered evidence about a third party's alleged guilt does not raise a reasonable inference as to the appellant's own innocence.             I took that to mean doesn't tend to show that the appellant is innocent.                    And you do have to have when faced with guilt.                   It's not relevant if it doesn't tend to show he's innocent.                       So that wasn't the problem. The problem is that this sentence is wrong. You could have incredibly strong evidence that this person is guilty and it could be incredibly strong evidence that the other person did it.            And so it should come right in.     So what should have been there is the word automatically, but the word doesn't automatically show, but the word isn't there.             It doesn't say automatic.        And he goes on to write as if it isn't that automatic.               And he then favors you because he says the standards set out in Gregory and Gay, as if they aren't different.        But the language says they are different.         So what do we do?        And so what do we do?     We get the -- we read the opinion literally, and moreover, that's why I asked it.           If you look into the evidence, it looks -- you know, maybe it's closer than you might think.       And if we start looking at the evidence of every case in the United States, it's going to be a problem for everybody.           But -- but -- so what do we do? That's my question.         What do I do in this case? I'm totally with you if I read American Jurisprudence and others as saying the following.                    Judge, there's a particular kind of evidence that really has a tendency to mislead the jury, that's that somebody else did it because they start trying the other person in their minds.       So if you have a strong case that this guy did it, don't let them even introduce that evidence unless you have some reason to think it's really going to show this guy didn't do it.            That's what it's saying, isn't it?        Okay.     Now, that gets us through Gregory.        And the difficulty here is that the court went on to say something that couldn't possibly be true, which is if you have a strong case against this guy, never admit this other thing.                That couldn't be right.        And so now what do I do with that particularly?         Because the other side has said, by the way, this is that case.        The trial court's findings -- I read them the way Justice Thomas did.
04-1329 +++$+++         But that --        -- that, I would think, would be one of the strongest cases for not having a per se rule because if, in fact, you have a justification, in terms of sharing risk with a new product, that would be one of the cases where you would expect to find a tie.           And -- and so I'm not really very persuaded by the effort to draw a wedge between requirements and other things. But what I do find very difficult about this case is -- you can see from what I'm saying -- that at the bottom, I think there are cases where tying is justified.          But the way to attack that would be to say here, here, and here it's justified and that would have to do with the tied product.               It would abolish the per se rule, making it into a semi-per se rule. But here, we're attacking a different thing. We're attacking the screen, which is a -- the tying product.         Now there, that's just a screen.                And -- and so I'm -- I'm not certain whether attacking the screen and insisting on a higher standard of proof is better than nothing or whether you should say, well, leave the screen alone and let's deal with the tied product on the merits.              That I think is what Justice Stevens was getting at too. And -- and I'm -- I'm not being too clear. You understand where I'm coming from, and I -- I want you to say what you want about that.                        But that's what's bothering me here.          All right.        This case isn't what's bothering me.         Well, that isn't so.    I mean, you could have a patent that was valueless or didn't itself confer very much, but the person is trying to establish the market for the product.                It's a component, and he attaches this tied product as a counting device knowing that if it's successful, everybody makes money, and if it's not successful, he and everybody else lose.              That's -- that's the kind of justification.           And that could happen with --         Let me be more specific.        A person has a patent on an item in a machine.                 This is a great machine.           It's fabulous.        We've all had friends who have tried to get us to invest in such machines. We don't know what it does, nor does anyone. (Laughter.)       To tie something to the great machine.       Correct, if it takes off.       If it takes off, everybody will be rich, and if it doesn't take off, who cares. Now --       -- that could happen.       And there often does, I guess.       I'll put this machine in your store for a penny.           A penny.        By the way, a penny and you have to buy marvelous component.                 And by the way, if it takes off, you'll buy a lot of marvelous component, and if not, not.         Let me try this again, and I'm thinking of a way of saying this more clearly. This is my actual dilemma. If I decide this case against you in my view -- and suppose it came out that way -- I would be concerned lest there be a lot of big companies in the technology area that have real market power in tying products and get people -- and they extend that power through a tie into a second market and thereby insulate themselves from attack.             I would be afraid of that really happening, and everything gets mixed up in a war of experts in a technology area about do we have the power, don't we have the power, and who knows. If I decide this case in your favor, I would then be afraid that particularly in the patent area, there will be lots of instances where new technology, uncertain technology, uncertain new technology, does not get off the ground because a very easy way to finance the risk through a requirements contract, for example, so that we make the money if the product succeeds, because people buy the required product at a higher price.            That will never happen.           And patents is an area where new technology is particularly at risk. So I see a problem both ways, and I'm really not certain what to do.       Well, I mean, once you start that, then you're saying that -- which I thought was the -- I would have agreed with the dissent -- the concurrence in -- in Jefferson Parish, but that's not the law.         And so now what you're saying is, well, we have to go and really make that the law.       If you're going to give me -- if you're going -- well.       There are no -- I thought we were just talking about several.       Price discrimination, I gather, sometimes good, sometimes not.                 If it pushes out sales --       -- on the low side, it's good.       If it just extracts profits on the high side, it's bad.       And so I think most economists -- in fact, everyone I've ever read agrees with that.
04-1332 +++$+++          Yes, but that -- that -- see, that's what's -- I'm not at all certain about this, whether they have an appeal, whether they don't have an appeal.           I'm testing it out. But it seems to me if we take your position, we're going to make things awfully complicated.              That is, the -- the basic idea here is in the vast mine run of employee suits, go sue the Government, and you can't sue the employee at all.              That's true of the State actions.         That's true of ordinary tort actions.       And so ordinarily, if you sued the -- the employee, whether you sued him first, second, or third, you're not supposed to and he ought to have an appeal right away to get you out of court. Now, there is an exception there with the Bivens because you can bring your suit first and then there's no problem.           But if we make an exception in the appealability rule for that, people are going to get mixed up.          It's a kind of curlicue, and even in the Bivens case, it has a basic objective of trying to prevent people from harassing the employee because the instances in which you bring a Bivens suit first, as a practical matter, are probably small. Now, what's the response to that?       I'm just nervous about making these collateral rules so complicated as to whether -- you'd have to do it whether it's a Bivens suit or some other kind of suit under this, and nobody is going to understand it.        So put in --        -- put them in the whole bag. Say give the employee his appeal because most of the time it's totally to help him from being harassed. Now, what's the answer to that?        And I'm not -- I'm putting it because I want to get your answer.            Your rule would be this. It's such a complicated area.                   I'm sorry.   But if a plaintiff brings a lawsuit, tort suit, against a Government employee and the Westfall Act bars the lawsuit, period, you can't sue him at all because of -- of (b).        He gets an immediate appeal if the district court doesn't agree.            But if under the Westfall Act you could sue him, depending on the order, he doesn't get an appeal.         I don't -- I don't understand.           If we were to take that, wouldn't we have to overturn Smith?          You think not.           You just said not. But as I -- then as I understand Smith, we look to (b) and (b) says, plaintiff, you cannot bring an action under anything.              Okay?      You can't bring a State tort law action.             You can't bring an action under Federal law against the employee, with certain exceptions where you can like Bivens and where there's a specific statute. Then we have over here the exceptions section.         And over here in the exceptions section, it says there is no Federal action for, among other things, the case in front of us and, among other things, actions in a foreign country.                    And so the court says, one, this is in a foreign country, so you can't bring it under Federal Tort Claims Act, and now we'll go look to see whether this bar that you can't bring it, period, applies.           They say it does apply. Now, Justice Stevens dissented, but he didn't dissent on that ground. And -- and so -- so I don't see how we could reach the result with this other exception without overturning Smith because Smith said (b) does apply. And so if the fact that it falls within an exception means the whole thing doesn't apply, then they would have held (b) doesn't apply.              But they said (b) does apply.        So how do we get there given Smith?       I mean, that -- that would be to overturn the reasoning of Smith.                 It would say --       Yes.       So, in effect, they didn't -- the Court didn't consider this argument in Smith.
04-1350 +++$+++              Well, if that's all it means, why don't they say it?              Well, then what is this word that confused me a lot, motivation?                     I found a lot of enlightenment in Judge Rich's idea of taking all the relevant art and putting it up around the room in pictures.     And then I thought, well, okay, if that art teaches me to do what your client did, okay, it doesn't. Does it suggest it?       Not really.            Well then, you say motivated.     Where does that get you?              For who?         For me?                For me the inventor?                I know that, because otherwise --                That's true. (Laughter.)                You look at that thing, you think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's a genius, is there are wheels that turn around.                     And the wheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you make the accelerator go up and down.                     Now I think since high school a person has known that if you have three parts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio one to the other, you can measure the speed of any part by attaching a device to any other as long as you know these elementary mathematics.              I suppose it wasn't Mr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured that one out.    So he simply looks to something that moves, and he sticks a sticker on it. Now to me, I grant you I'm not an expert, but it looks at about the same level as I have a sensor on my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is coming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it.                     So I think of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper hinge, okay?    Now I just think that how could I get a patent for that, and that -- now that's very naive, that's very naive.      But the point is, I don't see what we're talking about, and what is supposed to happen with all these affidavits.        And the -- the -- Mr. Asano himself, I would think at some point when the Ford company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of course will have every motivation in the world to do precisely what your client did, because he can't use that thing that pulls back and forth anymore.                  Rather, he has to get a little electronic cap and attach it to something that moves in fixed proportion to the accelerator going up and down.                Now those are my whole reactions when I saw this and I began to think it looks pretty obvious.     What's supposed to go on, I don't understand it.                As you know, we've had a series of cases and in these series of cases we have received many, many briefs from all kinds of organizations and there are many from various parts of the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent bar and others who are saying basically that they've leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications for the economy.    So if you're going to these very basic deep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I do now think, that there is a huge argument going on in those who are interested in patent as to whether there is too much protectionism and not enough attention paid to competition or whether it's about right, or whether it goes some other way. In other words, your argument now suggests all this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it isn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us to be involved in.      So what are your views since you brought it up?               It doesn't have to go on top.   It's just to say what you've been saying, that what you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a person, as the statute says, who is familiar with the subject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a person this would have been obvious.                     Now, there are many, and this Court has listed several, factors that might count in favor of it not being obvious, such as people have been trying to do it for a long time and they haven't been able to figure out how.                That's a good one, and there are some other ones here.                 If there's a teaching right there, it seems to cut the other way. But to hope to have a nonexclusive list seems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to have an exclusive list of what counts as negligence.                    In the law we have many standards that you can get clues about, but you can't absolutely define them, and why isn't this one of them?             Supposing we then were to say exactly what this Court already said, that the standard here is obvious, we list a few of these additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as the Court said before, all these additional factors are there.    They can be considered in an appropriate case, but it is important to remember that the ultimate matter which is for the judge is to apply the word "obvious" or not in light of the evidence and what the experts say and the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the factfinder.    Would you have any objection to an opinion like that.               Is it basically an invention where in fact there are only four or five moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the accelerator going up and down, as it must be because they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle thing coming out.    And so, whichever of those four that you figured out you were going to attach it to, it's obvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to the pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to a part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the movements of one of those two?              Now, that's what I would find fairly obvious.      Why isn't that obvious?              And it so quickly modified itself.                I'm sorry.       Doesn't the axis turn?             Isn't there an axis, and the axis turns?             The pivot rotates?
04-1360 +++$+++          Well, how is that different from saying the entry is lawful, its only problem is, it was done without a warrant?                 I mean, you know, he's --        -- inside the building; just, unfortunately, the means wasn't right.                   No warrant.        The means wasn't right. No knock-and-announce.        So, in fact --        -- if they had a bazooka - -        And the same would be true if what they had was a bazooka, and blew the house up. [Laughter.]        Yes, okay.        Oh, I see your argument now.      I think your argument is, most of the fourth amendment rules are really designed to prevent warrantless entries.          But this one isn't.          This one is designed to prevent damage to property --          -- et cetera.   So, let's not have the exclusionary rule and rely on the damage remedy where that kind of thing actually occurs, which isn't often.          And if we buy that principle, suppose we were to apply it in the Miranda area -- purpose of a Miranda warning is really to make certain he can have a lawyer, if he wants one, for example.           So, now we prove this guy wouldn't have asked for a lawyer anyway.               All the evidence comes in. I mean, it's an interesting principle.            I see the logic.          But it seems to me to have a lot of implications that this Court has never bought.          I can't think of any other area, fifth or fourth, where we've bought it.                And I've tried to explain, in the question, why we haven't bought it.           Now, you go ahead.         It depends, of course, on whether you -- what you're doing.                  Now I see what you're doing.          You're applying a kind of Palsgraf causation analysis within the risk -- I think that's what you're doing -- to saying it's outside, it's not a cause.         You're saying -- you don't say it's not a necessary condition of his being there.                   It is.   You do say, "Well, the being-in-the-room-there is not within the risk, the reason for which we have a knock-and-announce rule."             But, of course, that's a matter of judgment.          I mean, you could say the purpose of the cause -- of the knock-and-announce rule is to keep people out of there without knocking and announcing.        And if that's the purpose of it, it's right within the risk, right cause.        You just are looking at the harms that his being there in that room without announcing might bring about.               That doesn't mean that's why we don't have the rule.                    We have the rule to keep him out of there without announcing.        So, you do --        No, no --        -- the difference is --        All right, look, this -- you know, I'd appreciate your explaining this -- this seems to me what you're saying in your brief was the inevitable discovery.           The inevitable-discovery rule, in my -- the way -- the way I've thought of it, and I'd like you to correct me if I haven't thought of it correctly -- to use a kind of analogy, it's like a primitive tribe that beats a tom-tom every morning so the sun comes up.         Hey, the sun's going to come up anyway, and the bodies are going to be discovered anyway, in those cases.            And, in Segura, the warrant is going to be issued anyway.               So, it isn't a question of whether it would have been issued if they had behaved properly, it's a question of what will really happen in the absence of the illegality.        Now, that's what I thought inevitable discovery here was, and, in the absence of these people entering the apartment illegally, they wouldn't have found a thing, because --        -- there was nothing else in motion.        Now, which --        -- case is contrary to what I said?        Segura?        You have just said --        -- that, in Segura, they would have gotten in, anyway, under a legal warrant that had nothing whatsoever to do with the illegal entry.        The sun rose, anyway.        Right.        Exact --        No.    Well --        -- not "would have."     Did.
04-1371 +++$+++        In that --       -- in -- suppose a person bought the stock at price 30 before any fraud took place, and then he holds it, and then the fraud, and then, subsequently, the word of the fraud gets out, the price falls a lot, and he sells it.              Does he have a claim, under Federal -- ordinary -- you know, does he -- can he go into Federal court?       No.       Okay.       Yes.       All right, then --       -- then -- I see that -- then what's worrying me is this, that -- one thing worrying me is that -- let's take an ordinary buyer case.             All right? And what happened is that the -- some buyers would like to bring a fraud suit in Federal court.                  They have to go to Federal court now.         They can't go into State court.             But they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they say, "Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim, and we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely are going to be a class of holders that would also have the kind of claim you say."              So, there we are, same actions, all in the State court, just happens to have found a different class of claimant.                  And there always will be such a class.        Well, that's fine.       And I --        -- and what I'm not facing, in the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your interpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is -- to do is to get the cases in the class actions -- not all the cases -- but the class actions in the Federal court. And then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, where we've kept this action out of Federal court, there's going to be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff, in a State court.        Now, what -- that's a -- my concern.        What do you --        Can you -- can you ease my concern there?         Is there anything you can say that could ease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll just be in State court with a different class?        And, by the way, my concern is not that it's a "bad thing," in quotes.               My concern is that it's hard for me to think Congress would have done something that wouldn't have had much effect.       Right.      That's just --       But why, in your theory -- suppose you're right.         You're right.          I assume that. You can have these holder claims.               But why couldn't any buyer, who's -- has to go to Federal court because he has a buyer claim, just say, "I'll bring the holder claim"?       Because?       I know.      But what I'm asking is, What's the logic of that?             I mean, you're either right or you're wrong.        If Congress didn't want to cut off the holder claim, they didn't.           So, what's to show that they wanted to cut it off for some people, but not other people?        Not in this suit.        Not --        -- in this suit.        So, if I'm both --        -- I bought it in May, in reliance on this ridiculous thing.                    "Buggy whips make gold."       I believed it.         I bought buggy whips.       Now -- we're now in December.              And every month, they kept repeating it.           And my claim is, "Yes, I know, I bought it in May, in reliance, but I kept it in July, because I kept seeing it repeated and repeated."                   Do I --           -- have a claim?           In the Second Circuit, I do not.      But I want to know why not.          I agree with you.       But that's the trouble.           Because, in order to make the Second Circuit's argument, you have to say the following, "Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have a buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim, because that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want to engage in a futile act."                But now you're asking us to do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who doesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us to say, "Congress thought -- Congress thought an individual action there, their own separate action in the State court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to preserve the holder claim for them."                    Now, that's possible, but it requires me to think Congress is going through quite a few hoops here.
04-1376 +++$+++        I -- but I -- I didn't understand this now.          I guess I don't.          Forget the '94/'96 periods.       Suppose it stayed the same throughout.         Would you say, then, that someone who came illegally into the country, and he's caught, and he's married to an American, there's no possibility he can stay, no matter what, no matter how appealing?                   Is that the answer?       I'm -- yes, but you're talking technically.       Maybe there's --       -- some other way you could stay.       What's the other way?         Yes.         Which was what?         All right.        Well --         -- then it comes to the --         -- same thing.        So, that -- what I'm thinking is that a person who is here, and they marry an American -- all right? -- they marry a citizen.         Now, before this Act was passed, there was a way that if they're really good -- let's assume they're the best human beings around, and the Attorney General finds all that out, and everybody knows this is like a saint, and they say, "Okay, you behave well enough. You can stay."           Now, after the Act is passed, all those relevant actions have taken place in '86, long before. Now, there's absolutely nothing they can do.                     All they can do is go home.          And now I've learned that when they go home, they will be told, "You cannot come back, no matter what, for 5 years."             Now, that's a pretty harsh consequence, to separate yourself from your family or have your family come to a foreign country.               So, if I think the first part of this is a wash, you have a great argument, they have a great argument, and I look to the second part, does it attach new consequences to old and unchangeable behavior?               I say, yes, it sure does.       Now, why doesn't it?       Ah.     So, then, you're saying the answer I got before was wrong --       -- that, in fact --       -- I now have my client in, he's come after IIRIRA has been enacted, and he says, "I've heard about this in IIRIRA, and what in heaven's name am I supposed to do?"             And the lawyer says, "Get out fast, next train.          Go back.       And if you get across that border, you're safe.            Because at that point, you can apply; and you're a saint, and you've been married, they'll let you right in, because they'll find out." That's what your view of the law is.       It must be the one way or the other.       No, in -- and this is not -- I was saying the question --            -- would be, is this Act attaching consequences to old things that you couldn't do anything about?             And you're saying, "Not entirely. You can.         You can leave.          In which case, you'll be no worse off, except for the train fare."            Okay.
04-1414 +++$+++             I don't see --          All right.        I -- I have a question that you could just clarify a confusion.                       You want to bring into this case the question of whether or not anticipatory warrants are ever valid.                    I had a case in the First Circuit where I explained my view on that. I thought they would be reasonably described.                   So I don't know if that issue should be brought up here. Maybe. I can't figure out what issue should be brought up here.           There's a Van Treska case that says we ought to read these things in a common sense fashion.         All right? I read it.     My common sense says I have a warrant here.            It says nothing about anticipatory anything.         It says you can go and search for any of 16 items, 14 of which are in his house well before the delivery.         After all, he's had all this correspondence with these people about child pornography.                    They have terrific reason for thinking he might have some.                     And that's all it says.            And then it says, is there probable cause for a warrant that says go in any time now and search for any of these items, including what will be delivered, if that's when you do it? I say I look at the probable cause.              His probable cause is he thinks that another package is being delivered, and he's right to think it.                   Now, whether it is delivered or not doesn't add anything really to the issuance of the warrant.                   It might add to his personal confidence.             But that's my common sense opinion.         The common sense is the only question here is do they have probable cause to issue a warrant that allows them to search now, because that's what it says. So now how -- how, given that -- I grant you the Ninth Circuit went into all kinds of other things, but you explain to me, please, how I'm supposed to reach those other things and what I'm supposed to do, and why I'm wrong.        Oh, no, it's not supported. It's specific.         It says go to Jeffrey Grubbs' residence and then it has an attachment A which describes it with great specificity.                    And go and search for and seize the records and materials described in attachment B, and then we have 16 different kinds of items with great specificity.               That's it.       That's the end of this warrant, and that's what it says to do, and that's what he did.         And then he has a different affidavit which gives him the probable cause for issuing the warrant I just described.       Where does it say that?       No, no.       I'm reading the warrant.         I'm not reading the affidavit.             It happens to say that the affidavit is -- that that affidavit is -- it's in appendix A, appendix B, but it doesn't say anything about going in on -- where does it say that?       It says -- mine says, you may command to search on or before April 27th for 10 days the person/place named and make the search in the daytime between 6:00 and 10:00.               That's what mine says.       Then there's an affidavit about probable cause.           That's true.           So --       What's not stated?       Where is there a limit?       It is?       What is it that tells us that?       I just happened to read an affidavit where the -- the person says that he won't enter until this package is there, but there are a lot of cause I would think --       Well -- well, he says in his affidavit he's not going to execute it until this package is delivered, but that -- if I read it in a common sense way, say, of course, he isn't going to because he wants to get everything at once.                But after all, he's in the place.           I would say there's a lot of probable cause for him to looking for 12 of these items which are there whether this package is there or not. Of course, he's not going to execute it till later.       Maybe that's the answer.       Will you -- will you just help me with this?        Justice Stevens answered my question.         The word anticipatory.         The word anticipatory does suggest it isn't valid for a while. Nothing else in the warrant does. What am I supposed to do if I think there's adequate probable cause for issuing that warrant right now in respect to 12 of the things?                    And it's really pretty hard for me to try to understand what this warrant is about if I'm supposed to understand it, by reading through about 15 or 20 pages of small print and there discovering somewhere in the back of it some -- the post office says I'm not going to execute this until this other package gets there too.                    Now, that does make me nervous.           That -- that supports you.       I understand that, but it's not going to support you enough unless you connect this anxiety I'm having now about this being buried in page 28 of an affidavit when it's an important condition of the warrant, the only clue to that fact being the word anticipatory.            And there we are.         Now, you tell me why this anxiety, which is going to help you, is connected to something in the law.          No, please don't.      I start with an assumption that an anticipatory warrant is constitutionally valid.              I start with that assumption. I'm assuming that the conditions have to reasonably describe.         My anxiety is resting only on the fact that this warrant doesn't seem to be an anticipatory warrant but for one word, and to know what it's about, you have to look through 28 pages of fine print.                   Now, you connect that anxiety to something in the law.
04-1477 +++$+++         Maybe this day -- in today's world, a registered letter is worse than ordinary mail. That is, I don't think -- my understanding is that the post office, unlike FedEx and unlike UPS, if you're not home, they leave a -- a notice, you know, and you check a box, and if you check the box, they'll leave it off the next day.           We don't live in a -- my wife isn't home.       My wife works.         And -- and most wives no longer stay home to get the mail, and we don't all have butlers at the door. And you call up the post office.          They say, oh -- if you get through to a human being, which takes 15 minutes, after you go through the menu, they say, phone the post office branch.                  And they say go get in the car, find a parking place, get in the line, and there's half a morning gone. Now, why is that a reasonable way?           Why can't they do what FedEx does?               This is a world -- husband works, wife works, two children are screaming.                  We've got to get them to the doctor.                  We have to have them at school.        They have appointments all morning, and there's nobody home. So whatever they did with Mullane and said registered mail is fine, why isn't it unreasonable to use that system rather than use FedEx's system?           Well, why not?    It says calculated.            It may be.     Now, you tell me why it's so remarkable because I think I could take judicial notice of what life is like for most families in the world today, that they don't have butlers, et cetera.          Wait.     Let -- let them do that.       Fine.      Just have a little box and the person signs and says, tomorrow leave it at the house, just like FedEx does. (Laughter.)        See what you think of this. If in fact the letter --           No, but skip that.   What about -- you know, I was thinking precisely the same, but just with slight -- if you get the letter back and you don't have the FedEx rule, you either have to have the FedEx rule or send a letter.           No, because the purpose is to get reasonably calculated to get notice, and in the world today, there are an awful lot of houses where nobody is home, you know, and there's no convenient way for them to go to the post office without giving up a certain amount of work.               And so they say, forget it. If it comes from the lands division or something, who cares?       Now, that -- I don't know how you'd know how many there are like that, but it's a question of reasonable calculation now to get the mail through.           Is it a tiny minority --            Yes, but redeliver -- you have to be there to sign for it again.            All right.      Well, then -- then the problem --        -- I'm thinking -- what I'm thinking is that where -- where you're trying to reach a person, the means has to be reasonably calculated. I'm simply saying a means today is not reasonably calculated to reach the average person unless it gives him the choice of getting it when he's not home.                 All right? Now, there are two ways that could happen. One, you could modify that form or, second, the simple rule would be if it comes back undelivered, mail them a letter.        I didn't say all that.        I said do either.     What I -- what I was thinking of, which isn't clearly I think coming across, is send it certified mail, by all means. Fine.      He either has to sign and say, leave it off tomorrow, I'm not home, or if the post office doesn't make that available, then if the letter comes back undelivered, the person who's trying to send him notice has to send him an ordinary letter.
04-1495 +++$+++            If it is applied here, I -- I thought we just granted question one.                    There were two in the cert petition.              I -- my notes say we just granted question one.              And that means what they have is the screen.            We're going to screen out absolutely any such claim as yours if there is probable cause. Now, the reason they advance for doing that is that in the -- a reason is in the absence of a screen like that, here's what's going to happen.                     Every single case -- not every one, but millions of cases or thousands, anyway -- involving companies -- well, companies are going to Congress all the time.                    They have ads all the time.              They run into agency hostility all the time.           The Hell's Angels?           That's a pretty unpopular defendant.             They say things all the time that investigators disagree with.                 And what will happen is in a vast number of cases the defendant will decide to bring a Bivens action, particularly if he gets off, and then we'll have discovery and we'll look into every statement that the -- the investigator made to the prosecutor, and before you know it, we have a nightmare of tort cases.            And they say that's unfortunate to cut off a claim like yours, but after all, the prosecutors totally cut them off because they have absolute immunity. Now, we're saying at least let's restrict them, where investigators are involved, to cases where it turned out there was no probable cause, otherwise the criminal process itself will be seriously injured. Now, I take it that's the argument.              I'd like to hear your reply.            No, but are you going to -- I mean, is there any light you could shed?                     And that's why I asked in my question initially.                     I thought maybe there were some jurisdictions somewhere that -- that survive without the rule they want, but maybe I'm wrong.       And -- and how do I judge this?                I would be concerned.             I don't -- the -- after all, these other cases you mentioned are civil tort cases and -- and they don't involve the criminal process.                    And when we get into criminal prosecutions, we have rules on selective prosecution that are designed to screen out all but the very worst.            And that's what he's arguing for here.            Leaving -- is there anything you can say before I give up on this?                     And maybe the answer is no.            Is there anything you can say that would relieve my concern, which is completely practical at the moment, that if I decide in your favor, there suddenly are going to be large numbers of criminal cases where defendants will say the reason I was prosecuted was because of something I said?                     I was advocating motorcycles.                I was advocating beating people up.             I was advocating a congressional change of something.             Many, many such cases.             They'll all get at least discovery, and the prosecutor's door will become open to the world.             Now, that's what's concerning.               Can you say anything to relieve that concern?        So he's a witness.    Suppose his testimony --        Suppose that the person is convicted.        Yes.     Can you bring your Bivens claim anyway?        Really?         So that's a -- but it's not a civil case.        So you say that if he's convicted, after all, he may have been convicted but it may be because of the retaliatory motive.        Yes.        All right.        So you -- so you say --        -- if he's convicted, that's the end of it --        -- whether there was a retaliatory motive or not.        Oh, that's 1983.        All right.      So what he does is he --        -- he brings his action and he says here I am 20 years in prison and I agree I'm guilty, but they never would have prosecuted me without the fact that they hate the Hell's Angels and they, in fact, criticize everything that we say.        Because?        No, no.         He's saying I was -- I was guilty, but the -- all right.                    Anyway --        I won't force you into that.        I'll take basically virtually never if he's convicted.                    They concede that you could bring this kind of action if there's no probable cause.        So we're talking about that range where there was probable cause but acquittal.                    That's what we're talking about here.        Now, you're -- you're in the cases, but I'm -- I'm trying to pursue this.             You've given me another idea --        -- which is I would like to say one word about this.            I'm sorry to interrupt your train of thought here, but look. I'm looking for other screens.       Is there -- is there -- the particular point that they're worried about is you say we want to establish the retaliatory motive.        That's what's worrying them because they see, in that establishment of the retaliatory motive, discovery, and discovery means you not only talk to the investigators, but you're also talking to, as a witness, the prosecutors to find out who said what to whom in order to see if you could establish that they didn't like the speech of the defendant.              Now, can you give me any screen, not your case, but any kind of a screen that will help --        -- weed out the sheep from the lambs --        -- the goats from the sheep or whatever --        -- in that area?        But that -- that's true.         I now think we're making some progress.                 I don't think it is quite a qualified immunity.               I think it's possible and don't -- I'm putting words in your mouth and deny them if I am.          One, he's convicted, no case.       Two, no probable cause, everybody agrees there's a case. Three, now there is probable cause, but he's acquitted. Okay?         In that circumstance, suppose you say we cannot even allow discovery.                You don't even get to discovery on your retaliatory motive unless you show clearly, question mark, or unless you show likely, question mark, that the investigator not only retaliated, but he retaliated under conditions where any reasonable person would have known that what he was doing was contrary to the Constitution.         And if you don't show that as a -- as a threshold, you don't even get discovery.        I'd like to ask you one other question.        Suppose you win on this on the grounds we've been discussing.           What happens in the middle of the trial when a defendant wants to say the same thing? Can he avoid conviction by showing the same thing?        What happens when the same claim is made in the middle of a trial that I -- whether I'm guilty or innocent?                I haven't been convicted yet, and I want to show that this prosecution wouldn't have been brought in the absence of the retaliatory motive.          Can he make that claim in the middle of trial or not?        Well, no, he believes it.        No, no.         He's not acquitted.        He's in the middle of trial and he wants to say --        It's a criminal trial.        He's in a criminal trial, and what he wants --        No.        They read our opinion which holds in your favor.          Then the next thing is in -- in the criminal cases the defense lawyers say, hey, I -- I think my client wouldn't be here today were it not that the FBI had a retaliatory motive.        Because?        No, no, no.     They're going to show exactly the elements that we write in our opinion.
04-1506 +++$+++        Well, so why -- why then is it unreasonable for the State to take this position, the one that the government took?                They said, of course, we, the governments of State and Federal have only the right to attach the portion of that settlement that is representative of the medical expenditure.                 And where we're in on the deal, you'll all agree what that portion is, or there won't be a settlement and we'll proceed to trial.        But where we're cut out of the deal -- and we shouldn't be because there's a duty to cooperate -- we will assume in that instance that it -- every penny of that medical expense is included in the amount that was settled for.               And they say, given the statutes, that's a reasonable way of enforcing their Federal obligation to recover the money. Now, whether we agree or disagree with it as a matter of policy, what is wrong with their saying as a matter of law, we choose to interpret the words this way and implement the statute that way and we have every right to do it?          Why don't they?       But that's all consistent, of course, with their position.               They say Congress delegated to us the authority to interpret the words this way.         It is a reasonable interpretation of the words.       We don't deny that you can settle for what you want.       All we're saying is, where we're cut out, that that pile of money is deemed by us to include every penny of medical expense, and therefore we get it because we're not taking money that isn't medical expense.         We are taking money that does represent medical expense according to our deeming rules.       Now, what's legally wrong with that?       Suppose, though, that were the rule.           Just given your experience -- say, think of the generality of cases like this one -- would it be difficult for you, representing the victims, if the rule were that these statutes give the Government the authority that they want here, as I understand it -- the Federal Government -- which is to say you have an obligation to notify the State of the presence of settlement negotiations.                        Now, once you've done that, you've given them an opportunity to participate.             If they have that opportunity, thereafter they cannot attach more than what are the real medical expenses, which could be a matter for argument in a settlement like this.              But if you don't give them that opportunity, they have the right to presume that that settlement, which they knew nothing about, contains the full amount.           Because?          What are the practicalities of that?               Why would it hurt the lawyers representing victims?           It would just require a letter, certified.        Yes, but it's -- it's relevant.         And I'm trying to think through the practicalities of it, which you're more familiar with. Suppose that you win this.             If you win this, then the defendant's insurance companies know that they're subject to further liability for the medicals in every case.       And why won't they sit there and tell you at this settlement, hey, we're not going to enter into this unless you get the State involved so they sign off on it too?          We're not going to just compromise some of our liability.            I mean, it sounds as if we're going to get to the same place, that if -- if you prevail, probably the insurance companies will want the State to be involved or they haven't limited their liability, and if you lose, then we would have said that you have to get the -- the State involved.
04-1527 +++$+++         Yes, I --            -- I think the question -- maybe it just -- I don't understand, totally, how the Clean Water Act works, but I thought that what we're talking in this statute is a State rule that's called the State Clean Water Act rule.                    It's a creature of the Clean Water Act, isn't it?                 A water quality standard?            All right.      And, therefore, a State, I would think, that had some totally bizarre Clean Water Act standard might find that it had a standard that didn't fit within the scope of the Clean Water Act.             And, therefore, it wasn't going to be enforced here.             Is that right, or not right?          Maybe the Federal Government will explain this --           Just for the few of us who think the dictionary doesn't answer the case, is it possible you could say a word about why Congress would, or would not, have wanted, in effect, to incorporate all State water quality standards into a permission to build a dam?           Also to protect fish?
04-1528 +++$+++         He's translated it into 1974 or '72 real dollars.        It's $200.         The same question or $201.          But I have the same question Justice Scalia had.            I mean, the -- the question is you -- you have limits here of $100 per election.                 It's $200 per cycle.          For a House.     $300 for the Senate, $400 for a candidate for statewide office, including the Governor.              That's $200 for an election for Governor.           You throw in contributions in kind.           You say that the political parties themselves cannot give more than that $200 for an election for the Governor. If we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just the numbers Justice Scalia mentioned, and I would like to know why are they -- why does not give incumbents a tremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent plus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of spending as a challenger.                 In other words, why aren't these limits far too low?            It's not going to help to say incumbents had a bigger advantage before.                     That is, the question is, what we're interested in is -- at least what I've written that I'm interested in, is at what point do these become so low that they really, as a significant matter, shut off the possibility of a challenge.             And from that point of view, your numbers, which do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive district, and your numbers, which do not explain all the problems that Judge Winter had with these things, do not help.            That's why I'm asking you the question.            I want your answer.          I'm not talking about the expenditure.           I'm talking about the contribution limits.        I and my friends have the following thought. We don't know who the candidates for State rep are, but we want a Republican slate or we want a Democratic slate.       So we get all our $5 together, give them to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party in Vermont, and lo and behold, that party cannot give more than $100 in an election to a State rep, et cetera. Now, to the -- to the ear, that sounds as if a challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that wants to challenge is going to have a really tough time.       So I want you to explain it.        Just can I ask a technical question here?        Just -- is -- is it the case or not the case that if I contribute my car to drive the candidate for Governor, let's say, between Burlington and Montpelier, and I buy the gas, does that count against the limit?            Yes or no.        I'm a volunteer and I buy gas and drive him back and forth.        No.    He drives.        Okay.     I got the idea.           If he does -- if I do, it's not. What about I have a coffee -- coffee.                I wanted to get the line.            I see it.          Coffee.   I want to have coffee and donuts, free donuts because -- and coffee for people to come in.               Is that counted or not?        Okay?     Count it or not?        Donuts and coffee.           In other words, it counts as long as it's over $100.        Under $100.         Under $100.        Counts.            On your question -- the -- I'm sorry.        I thought the --        Wasn't it the State auditor?        No, I know, but didn't we have in front of us a limit, which I wrote was rather border, that involved a State auditor campaign?        I thought so, in Shrink Missouri.        Which is not quite the same political volatility perhaps, but --        I have a different question I'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed yet.      On the expenditure limits, there is a case, Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that expenditure limits are not constitutional.              Now, whether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am I not bound by that? And insofar as you try to distinguish it, you've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts to distinguish it.         And therefore, I'd like to hear why you think I'm not bound by a past precedent in an important matter, with which I may or may not have agreed at the time.
04-1544 +++$+++          But this is all -- this has nothing -- I mean, I -- you have the total differently -- different understanding than I do of this case, and I did read Judge Carter's opinion.                    I thought that case simply held that because your clients had interfered with an effort by J. Howard to give quite a few millions of dollars to Vickie Marshall -- because of that interference, they had committed the tort of inter vivos interference with a gift, and they had to pay damages. Now, they said a lot of things by way of what the evidence was.         Indeed, they did say, as you point out, that your clients forged three pages of the will. But that was simply evidence of their bad intent, and it did not invalidate anything in the probate proceeding, as I read it. Now, what have I said that's not right?        I'm not interested in what he said.         I'm interested in what Judge Carter said --        -- because that, it seems to me, is -- and what is it that Judge Carter did that was wrong in this respect?        That -- that sounds to me like a matter of preemption, but -- but -- or not preemption but, you know, res judicata. But just out of curiosity or -- because I think it is relevant, did the Texas probate court have in front of it the documents among the lawyers that the district judge, Judge Carter, relied upon in showing that there was an intent to create the catchall trust?        It had all those documents.        Why?     Why?   Why?   That is to say, what the finding is, is that there was a different matter, a catchall trust, and he told the lawyers, go draw it up so I can give gifts to her, the increase in the value of my property during the 13 months we're married, do it, and they never did it.                    Now, that seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with the GRAT trust or with the will.             It just happens that those are evidentiary, what went on there, of what likely happened with the catchall trust. So I don't see why those are necessary.              I don't see why they're more than evidentiary, and I don't see whether or not those are barred, those particular facts have anything to do with this, as far as jurisdiction is concerned. Now, explain to me why I'm wrong.            Well, that's just one of the things.        Among other things that went on were they hired private detectives to go after her, to keep her from the bed.               I mean, you've read that opinion and there are like about 30 things in there.                      And I grant you that one of those things is the fact that three pages of the living trust, according to the judge, were created after the event of that trust and slipped in without his knowledge.             I mean, it's quite a story.        And -- and so I -- but as I read it, there were many, many, many things involved here, and this is just one of them.                   So how can Texas say that you have to prove this particular one as -- as opposed to proving a lot of others?          I don't think they're going to impose a constructive trust, are they?                 All -- all they're going to say is pay her the money.          They're going to say it because they make a finding that through a whole variety of various devices, all of which were listed, that J. Howard, who wanted to give her money through something called the catchall trust was prevented in about 15 ways.           And even if you're right that there's a Texas finding that those three pages weren't slipped in, well, how do we know?               Maybe it was a valid GRAT trust, but if only they hadn't tried to isolate J. Howard from contact with her, J. Howard would have figured out what had happened before he died and he would have told his lawyers, hey, cut this out.                  Do what I want.           Revoke it.     But all that is just hypothetical.           I'm just using that to show you why I think this is evidentiary not a matter of what the elements of the crime are -- or the elements of the tort are.        What's the cite on that that I -- that I need for --        You're saying you can't bring an inter vivos trust -- an inter vivos -- interference with an inter vivos gift action in Texas unless you show that a will, for example, is invalid.        By the way, in Texas if you have to go through all this probate stuff and everything, and they want to claim 15 years ago my mother gave a ring to my cousin who stole it, is that precluded to bring that tort action when the person who, you know, was supposed to get it finds out about it?         So -- so, in other words, if it -- when the guy is 2 years -- 15 years old, he gives a ring to somebody, and now he dies at age 93, and when they find out about that incomplete gift at age 15, nobody can bring a lawsuit anymore.                    You have to go to the probate court.
04-1581 +++$+++          What is the difference with this?       I mean, in my mind are possible as-applied challenges.          Bread for the City.        Never supported the candidate, worried about the hurricane in Louisiana. Vote for relief for New Orleans.                Write your Senator, Senator X. Organization two.        Never supported a candidate one way or the other, but has an issue they're always interested in, and they run ads cycle after cycle after cycle and they don't want to pull them just because October has come along. All right?     Now, think of those organizations where I think maybe, sure, maybe they'd win their as- applied challenge.           And here, you're not arguing it -- he doesn't have a right to bring it.                    You're arguing, of course, he can bring an as-applied challenge.                    He's just going to lose given our rationale.                    All right? Why?         But --       That's what I want to know exactly.         I didn't think -- I thought Congress considered this impossible question.                   I thought that 7 percent figure was from a study, in fact, dozens of studies, where these people who were experts, quote, decided that about 7 percent of the ads like this one distinguishing between really interested in issues or interested in issues but, in significant part, defeating the Senator.           In the latter, of course, it's campaign and it's part of the regulation of campaign funds. But they didn't think we could do it.           They thought first they could do it, and then they told the FEC to go and produce a set of regs that would, in fact, try to screen out that legitimate 7 percent.              Am I wrong about how the statute was supposed to work?       Well, why haven't they done it? And I had thought also that they were supposed to control 527's by having regs or individual cases that would decide whether there was a mix of personnel between the campaign and the 527, whether they talked to people and planned their strategy.             Have there been those regs written?
04-1618 +++$+++  
04-1704 +++$+++         Have you found any other instance in which -- any case -- there was a absolute lack of standing, prudential standing, but the Court waived that, because it was prudential and not constitutional?        Which one?
04-1739 +++$+++        Now, I'm parodying it, but you understand why I don't think it's your strongest for the reasons said. But are there others which might be a little -- you had other arguments --          No, no.       It has nothing to do with the law.            I understand your argument.         Your argument that you have made is, at the very least, you can't say that this deterrent effect is that big a deal.       I mean, now, there were other reasons justifying it.      They said, for example, if one --          Yes, and they made a big case in this.            It's on 188 in the appendix.          And they made a major point. They said that with the newspapers, they set fires, they throw feces.           They use them as a spear, and then when asked, why couldn't you do the same with library books, or couldn't you do the same with paperbacks, they said, yes, it's possible, but it's less likely because of the size of the document.                   And we don't have to forbid everything.           We just forbid the things that we think are particularly likely.                Now, what about that one?       What is it that I should read then in respect to what's actually bothering me?                   In Turner v. Safley --       -- the Court says we resolve, when a prison regulation impinges on an inmate's constitutional rights, which it does here, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.                That standard is necessary if prison administrators and not the courts are to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.            And that's where I think it's difficult to balance this case.                   If we were to decide for you, are we going too far in interfering on what the prison administrators should be doing, or have they gone too far? Now, if I'm supposed to look at this record and try and make up my mind, which I think is about that question, what do you want me to look at?         Well, I'll read the briefs. I have no problem with the briefs --
04-373 +++$+++        Well --       -- what about just simple thing like this, that there is an implication in what Reese said, that he listens to in his cell, "I guess you'd -- he'll want to talk to us now, huh?"         The implication is that he faces death, and he'll be better off by talking to them without a lawyer.       So, suppose Johns had said to the defendant, "Mr. Blake, I want to tell you something.                 My colleague here has implied that you will be better off, because of the death possibility, in talking to us without a lawyer. We want to tell you, that isn't true.               There is no way that you'll be better off talking to us without a lawyer.                  You will be at least equally, from your point of view, as well off if you talk to a lawyer."            Now, that might have cured it, I guess.        Yes, but if you're looking -- if you're taking your standard seriously --       The reason that my -- I was able to give my hypothetical before --       -- the reason that you'd have to say, "You will not be better off -- you will not be worse off in respect to the death penalty, by -- you know, we -- it won't" --       -- "make you any better off to talk to the lawyer" -- Sorry.   Strike. The reason that the policeman, to cure, would have to say, "Look, it's not going to help you, in respect to the death penalty, to talk without your lawyer," is because that was the implication of his question, that was the implication - -       -- of the wrongful statement.       The implication was, "You're not going to get death if you talk to us without a lawyer."       But if it had been some other questions, some questions, for example, about the crime, all you would have had to do was eliminate whatever negative implication came out of those questions, which might have been nothing.          So timely --          Yes.       All right, so --       -- maybe you should modify the standard.        Maybe the standard ought to be that where you have an improper line of questioning, after the warning, that the police either have to negative the implication of those questions, the relevant implication, or the State has to show that some other series of independent events, such as Justice Kennedy mentioned, made the difference.                   That is, caused the later request to talk without a lawyer.                   And if they can't show the one or the other, then they lose.
04-433 +++$+++         I mean, if that's so, then go back for a minute, please, to Justice Souter's question.         It doesn't concern violence.         I'm -- certainly if violence is involved or a direct action against an employee or the competitor himself, then I'll assume you'd win. But the line I think that he drew very clearly and I think Justice Stevens picked up on, as I heard it, is a -- a fraud where the person defrauded is not the competitor and the only effect of the fraud is to lower the cost of the person who is doing the fraud. Now, if that's so, you either draw Justice Souter's line or you don't.             If you do draw Justice Souter's line, then you stay out of the thicket.                   If you don't, you'll have all the problems that were mentioned, that there is no way to distinguish between one person, two persons, 100 people.                   There is no way to know whether the lower cost of the defrauding person did or did not lead to the shift of sales.                  There is no way to know, indeed, whether it's a rent, in which case prices didn't fall, or whether it's actually some kind of ability of the competitor -- of the defrauding person to take over the market. All those things that are issue in antitrust cases and totally unsolvable are suddenly imported into RICO, where if you really want to bring a case, bring an antitrust case, and at least people know how to face it there.         That's -- that's the -- that's the kind of claim -- that's the kind of problem that I think you're facing, and I'd like you to have the chance to respond to it.         So what does that mean? Then that means you have like the family vendetta exception to the RICO -- (Laughter.)        But, I mean, you see the point.       The point is I don't see how it's administrable in a law, particularly in an economic context --        -- where people who are interested in making money are prepared to say, look, we want to make the money.              We'd like to get rid all our competitors, and then we start distinguishing between they'd like to get rid of all of them.                No, only five.          No, one.   And does that make a difference in whether you can bring a case or not?                 I frankly don't see --          Where it would come from would be it would be an alternative way of getting to, say, Justice Souter's test, and it couldn't -- I agree with you -- depend upon whether these are within the realm of people who are relying.                   But suppose you had a fraud where nobody had relied.                  You see, it was really a failed fraud, and you can get that under Federal law.          Or suppose you have a fraud where the only party that had relied was the government, in which case you don't need them for civil RICO.       And the strong argument, I think, would be where that's the case, cut it off because of all the indirect problems that Holmes goes into.                  I'm not -- I'm not accepting it.            I'm just trying --           -- to put it in what I think of as a strong form.         The place where it comes from is the idea that if, in fact, you have these monetary crimes, white collar kinds of crimes, money is at issue, and no one is hurt.                You can proceed against a person under Federal law --         -- where no one is hurt. You catch it in the bud, for example, where no one is hurt.       You don't want the possible class of plaintiffs to spread out into every competitor, into competitors' suppliers.          It's a way of cutting off the potential class to people who are closer to any possible injury where, for example, there really wasn't any injury at all.      So, I mean, that's the kind of argument being made for it, not that you find the word reliance somewhere in the statute.          Well, I just tried to say where -- where it was.              It's a -- it's a way of -- with proximate cause, and that's how I think you have to deal with it.            You have a case where there was reliance.          The government.          So what you'd have to say is why that's good enough.
04-473 +++$+++         I guess our law clerks would meet it every day.        Yeah, maybe, maybe not.         I don't --        -- anything that goes on in my chamber that isn't a matter of public concern, and I would think everything at OSHA and everything at -- look, I'll -- let me put my question to you, because you're going to make an argument that I don't think is too widely shared; namely, that Pickering decides this case.                  If that's your argument, I'd like to ask you a question based on the assumption Pickering does not decide this case.                   And it seems to me that Pickering involves a case in which it's both a matter of public concern and outside the scope of employment.           And here we have a case that is a matter of public concern, but inside.           So, in those circumstances, I want to know how you believe the first amendment requires us to decide this case.               And as I read this case, in the record, we have one individual, your client, who looked at an affidavit.             The affidavit said that the deputy sheriffs were trying to locate where a vehicle that was chocked up came from.          They saw tire tracks.           The tire tracks went back to a fence at the end of a long driveway. So, I looked in the record.              I couldn't find the affidavit.          So, I assume that's what it says.              And I wanted to know what the deputy sheriff said.                       What they said is that your client agreed that there were tire tracks.        There were tire tracks that did not go the whole length of the driveway, but, rather, tire tracks near the house, where they got the search warrant for.                      And, they added, that -- the deputies -- that there was rocks broken up. All right.      So, we have two sides to this argument: the deputies, who might reasonably contend that they did nothing wrong; your client, who thinks they were lying.       And we also have a letter that your client wrote, where he said that these deputies are grossly inaccurate and clearly misleading. Suppose his supervisor goes to him and says, "I think that that letter is not the right tone.                 Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong; maybe they're in good faith, maybe they're not.             And so, if you don't change that tone, I'm going to discipline you."                 All right? Now, that's my hypothetical, which seemed to me, perhaps, very much like this case.                 How, in your opinion, does the first amendment handle such a matter?        Which is what I'm looking --        -- for.         I'm looking for --        -- a standard.        No, no there is --        Look --        I'm not making my question too clear.       I imagine the district judge.               I get just the facts I described to you.             Your client, who's very upset, says, "This is the most unreasonable thing that ever happened.         They were trying to prevent me from communicating with the judge.               I'm the one who saw the sheriffs.         They didn't."     The other side says, "We think it's reasonable what we did." My question to you is, What standard does that judge apply under the first amendment?                  What does he do?          We live in a world where people are leaking things all the time.                  And there are thousands of things that are in the public interest every day.                    But what's bothering me is, while I see the Government's rule as protecting the interests of the employer, it's very hard for me to believe that never is there an instance where the first amendment offers protection.                   But the only choice you've given me is a rule that says every dispute of the public interest is going to go right into constitutional litigation.             And I don't like that either. So, am I hopelessly --        -- forced to choose which is the lesser of the evils, or is there some middle approach that gives discretion to the Government, but doesn't allow them to exceed that discretion in a certain category of cases?       If so, what?     And --        -- how would you phrase it?          Is that your answer?         All right --         -- I've got -- you've got me part of the way.           Now, I'm not saying I -- I have to think this through, but you got part of the way.                      You say here, there's an independent constitutional basis for the speech being permitted.           But, now, still within that, the Government agency has to have some authority to discipline a person, even there, because, after all, he might have been accusing these sheriffs of things that were really not justified by what they, in fact, did.                      Or maybe he was right.        What about that part of the standard?                Do you want to say that the Government wins, as long as it behaved reasonably?           Do you want to say that the Government loses only if there was an abuse of ordinary employer discretion?           Do you want to say the Government -- et cetera.        What do you want to say?         All right.      Suppose --         -- we were to write this, hypothetically.           Indeed, the employer has broad discretion to discipline the employee for the manner -- or whatever he does -- even in such an area, but that discretion can be abused.          And, therefore, it is up to the judge to determine whether a jury could find such abuse of discretion here.
04-52 +++$+++             So what is the point?        The judge says, I ll give the prosecution the benefit of the doubt.          Well, he -- he knows the prosecutor and he believes the prosecutor.               I didn t see it, but I ll give him the benefit of the doubt.                    He told me that s what she did.            What s -- I mean, I really don t see why that isn t, given the present law, sufficient.          You mean benefit of the doubt just refers to youth.                  I -- I read that as referring to the whole story.          I mean, I -- it s pretty hard to read that as saying, I ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to the youth.                     It sounds as if I ll give him the benefit of the doubt in respect to the reasons he gave for challenging her.                     There are two other African American jurors on the jury.                     She is useful -- youthful.            He -- she saw him -- he saw her rolling her eyes when -- what do you think about the drugs or some other relevant question.                   And he says, I ll give him the benefit of the doubt.                   I mean, I don t see how to read that in a way that -- that comes out the way you want it to come out.         So tell me.       So what is the remedy -- the remedy if we say and hold with you that prosecutors can t give reasons like they gave here?                         How is a -- what s a prosecutor supposed to do?                         I mean, the prosecutor might be moved by stereotype.                         Young African American women -- of course, she tolerates drugs. Well, not quite of course.                  Well -- well -- well, she rolled her eyes.             Well, at least she looked in this direction.          Well, I sort of -- maybe I m seeing eye- rolling here.             I mean, we all understand that.              But that s why I guess I am where I am.                         I -- I don t see what the -- I don t see what we re telling prosecutors if we hold in your favor, and I don t see how we deal with the problem if we hold against you.            But I m asking for your experience.              You have a lot of experience as a defense lawyer.        How is this thing supposed to work?
04-593 +++$+++         Is targeted enough?       I mean, I'm thinking here not necessarily your case, but in general.         Is a claim of discrimination -- I don't know the state of the law, but maybe if a minority shareholder -- a minority person is the sole shareholder of a corporation, maybe that corporation could assert protection, or maybe it couldn't. But here, I take it that the corporation JWM brought an action and won or settled for $45,000.                  So they're out of it. Now we're just thinking about the sole shareholder, and the sole shareholder says there's another action here.         And as to the two most plausible ones that I would like to assert an action as a third party beneficiary, we've heard the other side say that you've conceded you have no right there.               And as to the other one, which might be protected in many cases, that the -- knowing that what was going to happen, they deliberately interfered with the contractual relation between me and the corporation.               That's what we're asking about now.         And you say, well, I didn't raise that. Now, is there a reason you should be given an opportunity to raise it?           You conceded that out.           Because?       That might --            Then the argument for sending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when you look at the question presented, no one could possibly file a lawsuit -- and you didn't -- on the theory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me. That isn't a legal theory.            Rather, the legal theory here was that this contract-related section of the law is violated.             And you want to say the simple fact that the contract wasn't between MCDonald and JWM, that's a separate matter.             That doesn't bar you from bringing your claim.              So, on the one hand, you argue that I can bring my claim as long as I'm a target and the motive as to why they breached some other contract, the one between the two corporations. And we seem to have it conceded that even if that's too broad, there are at least some circumstances where you could bring your claim.                  One is if you were a third party beneficiary.              That's not present here.       And the second is if you are a target such that their action violates and interferes with a contract between you and your own corporation.                At least you have that going for you.           So you say, well, if I was wrong about the broader theory, give me a chance to allege the narrower.         Is that right?         I'm trying to be helpful in this respect. (Laughter.)         No.     You have to say there's certain kind of target.             The kind of target is that they --       -- were discriminatory, aiming at me, et cetera.         Do you have an action --         -- on that in California? Wouldn't you have an action in the State if somebody goes and deliberately interferes with your credit and so forth?
04-597 +++$+++           So far, you're halfway into your argument.            I thought the basic question here was, first, whether a Court of Appeals, or anybody, can grant a J- -- what used to be called a JNOV without your making its -- whatever it's called now -- and without somebody making it a motion.             And from your not opposing that, I guess the answer to the question is, of course not.                   Of course you have to make a motion.                  You have to make a motion for everything.             The judge is not a genius.       He can't -- is not a mindreader.                 And if you don't make a motion, you lose.            Okay?    Now, is there any argument against that?          No, I -- I mean, I thought -- there are two parts to this.                Question one is, Can you possibly get a judgment -- what used to be called a JNOV or a JMOL or whatever -- from the Court of Appeals, when you didn't make a motion for it, after the jury came in, in the District Court?          They say, "Of course you have to make a motion."            And, so far, I've heard no response whatsoever to what I'd think is a fairly basic question in this case.          And I'm assuming: of course you have to make a motion.        But even if there were, how could this kind of error ever be plain?        Ever?        If there's no evidence at all. You have a patent, and a patent is a monopoly.                 And so, what -- obviously, it monopolizes a market, it monopolizes the market of the patent.             And you'd have to be a genius in antitrust law to know something's wrong with that argument.         And so, how could it all be plain?        That has nothing to do with my question.        You were saying that the mistake was that there was not sufficient evidence that there was injury of an antitrust kind, and that there was a market.         So, I'm saying a person who knows a little, but not a lot, of antitrust law would think, "Obviously, there's a market here.            There's the market covered by the patent."        Obviously, there's injury, because a patent allows you to raise the price.                 End of the matter.          Now, that's naive, but somebody who doesn't know antitrust law thoroughly couldn't possibly think that there is plain error here.             What's the response to that?        What I'm worried about, to put all my cards on the table -- if we were to say there is even a possibility of plain error in this case, the plain- error exception in the rules would become a monster, wherein complex cases, people who hadn't made the proper motions would all be arguing plain error just as if they had.
04-607 +++$+++         Now what do you say in response to my question to the Solicitor General?        That they thought it was obvious, that they thought that obviously the problem here with this particular claim is that it doesn't say specifically which tests this principle is meant to apply to.     So it isn't definite enough.             It never occurred to anyone that if you tried to apply it to every test, it was somehow a valid patent, so they made it in the definitive context.        Because for 154 years, it's been clear that you can't take a principle of nature like electricity and simply make a claim for all uses of electricity to create letters. That's their analogy. And they thought by referring to the cases and by referring to the failure to point out definitely what the tests were this applied to, it violated 112 because otherwise, it wouldn't be a valid patent, which everyone in the patent field would know.              That's at least, I think, what they're saying.          You're onto something, to me, that is absolutely fundamental.                 You have millions of doctors and scientists and computer people who are working extremely hard to think of useful ideas and if you don't give them an incentive, they may think of less.          And they're all useful.       At the same time, if you patent all of their ideas, including very useful mini-micro principle ideas, you will establish monopolies throughout this country beyond belief and it will be difficult for people, without paying vast amounts of money, to use their useful ideas. So what principle do we use to separate the scientific idea which can't be patented from the process which can be?            I thought that the claim was settled by Morse, Flook and Diehr.              Now would it make sense -- you can answer any part of this question you want.         Would it make sense to send this back and say, look, at least address their argument? You can answer any part of that.           Does that fall within it? I mean, I can't resist pointing, as one of these briefs did, the phrase anything under the sun that is made by man comes from a committee report that said something different.         It said a person may have invented a machine or a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that is made by man. So referring to that doesn't help solve the problem where we're not talking about a machine or a manufacture.             Rather we are talking about what has to be done in order to make an abstract idea fall within the patent act.          Now, sometimes you can make that happen by connecting it with some physical things in the world and sometimes you can't.        And if you have a clear statement other than Diehr, Flook, Morse, which draws that line properly, let me know.
04-623 +++$+++        Yes, because, I mean, wouldn't -- suppose that some State said that, "We think doctors can prescribe, for people who want to take it, morphine for recreational use."         No matter what?   I mean, they have cases and so forth that say, "Of course a State could go too far.           A State might decided it's" -- just what I said.       And you're going to say your case turns or falls -- you win or lose, depending on whether I accept that a State could not stop a doctor from becoming, in effect, a conduit to a group of drug dealers by saying, "I think recreational use is part of my medical practice"?                That would be up to the State?         No.       Suppose I disagreed with you about that, then would you lose the case?       I'm asking, if I disagreed with you that I thought -- we take the facts of Moore, where he's a drug pusher, the doctor, and, for some unknown reason, the State says, "That's fine, it doesn't violate State law," but the Attorney General says, "Do what you want about State law.            I think it violates the Federal law."       Suppose I think the Attorney General does have the right to do that for -- assuming it -- assuming it -- then what do you say about this case?       Would you spend a minute --       I'm sorry, on that, I didn't think that the reg was defining the word "dispense."                I thought the statute defines the word "dispense."              And it's -- persons registered by the AG to dispense controlled substances are exempt.           And then you look at who is such a person.        A person who does that is a practitioner.         And who is a practitioner?           A registered practitioner is one who prescribes, a physician registered by the United States to distribute or dispense a controlled substance in the course of professional practice.                     And I thought this reg is defining "in the course of professional practice." Am I wrong about that?            I thought it was a reg that says, "In the course of professional practice, the prescription, to be effective, must be a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner."                Now, I might be wrong.         How does it work?         On the matter of policy, I would -- since -- if you -- if you've said basically what you want to say in your argument, I would appreciate your devoting a minute to an assumption which you don't want to agree with.           But suppose I were to assume that a State is not free, through the device of defining what's good medical practice, to gut the Act -- that is, to really make marijuana or something else, like morphine, legal -- because they disagree with Congress's basic judgment that it should be illegal.            That could happen.         Now, suppose I think that the AG does have the power to stop Congress from gutting the Act.      All right?      Now, on that, do I have -- if I believe that, on that assumption, do I have to decide this case against you?        And if not, why not?        Suppose, on the commerce-clause question, I -- on assumption, I don't agree with you, either -- then do I have to decide? [Laughter.]        Far be it from me to suggest an argument that you don't want to make, but, I mean, I've found it different, in life and law, when you pass a rule in a State that guts an Act, from when you pass the rule in a State that doesn't seem to have much to do with the purpose of the Act.
04-631 +++$+++            What's strange about it?           I mean, every upstream tax, as Mr. Olson said, raises the price of goods and services.                  And it's harder to retail them, because they cost more.                  So, that's true of every single good sold on the reservation.                       So I take it your claim must -- and, of course, it may or may not be true that the tribe can put a tax on that.                  It depends upon            But suppose they can't?            Well, my question is, If we hold for you here, and we don't take an absolute principle, well, I guess States are forbidden to put any upstream taxes on.            Why isn't that so?        Well, we ought to know, because they've been -- haven't they had this for a while?                   So, there must be a dealer somewhere who's not on the reservation -- he's a distributor -- somebody delivered to him a thousand gallons, and it's sitting there in his tank.       Doe he have to pay the tax, or doesn't he?       Well, if he would --       -- pay the tax, then it is not --       -- on his --       -- redistribution.       He is -- sorry -- if -- I'd like to ask the question.       If -- and you can say why this is wrong -- if he gets a thousand gallons from whoever -- Exxon or somebody -- and he puts it in the tank, and he hasn't sold it, and he has to pay the tax, then it would seem to me to be a sale on the distribution to him, not the sale on his distribution to somebody else.               Now, why is that wrong?         So, now you're telling me something different from what I understood.                  I thought you said it probably has happened in the history of this tax --         -- that a distributor picked up a gallon of fuel, held it, and has not yet redistributed it.      So, you're saying that's never happened.         If I'm certain about what the tax is on, what should we do?                  Dismiss the case or send it to the -- ask a question, or what?            All right, suppose you're right.        Can you answer my first question?               Can you even remember it?              I'll summarize.       On your assumption.     Look, the Indians, if there is a tax -- they have a retail shop or they have things on the reservation, they go buy them -- Kansas can't impose a tax on what goes on, on the reservation.              We go through the balance.         But they certainly could impose a tax on the department store in Kansas City, couldn't they?            And so, the Indian then goes to the department store and buys it.                     He has to pay the tax, doesn't he?       Okay.     Now what he does, he says, "Call up and" -- he says, "Please deliver it."                     Now he doesn't have to pay the tax?       Is the commerce constitutionally --       All right.        Well --       -- we're now talking Federal rules.        Go ahead.           All right.         So, if balancing --           -- then how do you come out? Because what they're saying is, "Okay, balance.                        Fine. You want to balance?             Here's how you balance."           On the one hand, the Indians have to pay the tax.             Okay, that's true.             And it's harder for them to impose their own tax.                    That's true of every upstream tax.             And it goes for roads that they use all the time.       And they just have a one-and-a-half mile -- and why shouldn't they be treated every -- like everybody else, when they're going to use the roads the tax pays for?                           So, the balancing works in their favor.                        Now, what's your response?       Well, if that's a winning -- of course it is different, in the sense you say, but if, in fact, it's an interference -- look, every upstream tax raises the price of goods and services.                 Every upstream tax -- indeed, every tax in the world -- makes it harder to sell the product.         So, every tax makes it harder for the tribe to tax that item which was taxed by somebody else.       Now, if that's the basis for saying it's an interference, then every tax is an interference.                  And I don't see how that could be.       But, so far, your theory is based on economics, as I've heard it.           But if it isn't, I would like to know what it is.           The incidence of the tax --           Oh.           That's very surprising.     When I read the statute, it doesn't have one word about the retailer being obliged to pay --           -- anything.           All right, if that's --       -- the legal incidence of the tax, I would think their side would win, in my mind.                   Now suppose, actually, the legal incidence of the tax is not on that retailer, but, rather, is on the distributor.       If that's so, and if we get into balancing, which I don't know, what is to be said in favor of the Indian side?            It sounded to me as if it's harder for them to tax.            So, I'm thinking, well, that's true of every tax.         And then, put it on something else. Put it on the tires.         Put it on anything else, if you can. It'll be harder for them to tax non-Indians.                 But I didn't know they had a Federal right to tax the non-Indians.            Is the one other -- the interest other than the interest on being able to tax an item that an upstream tax prevents you from doing because of the economics?       Is that the only one, or are there other ones?       I've got the -- --       -- I --       -- I want to hear you and know if there's an additional one.              I'm not disputing that one. I just want to be sure I get them all.                 One is -- one is that one.       What else?
04-698 +++$+++         Well, if I take -- if I accept your view of that, that would be a Federal rule written into the statute.          And that would mean that, even if the Department of Education came to a different conclusion, or even if we have a bunch of States that come to a different conclusion, or even if it's in Minnesota, they want to have a rule that "sometimes it's one way, sometimes the other way," we couldn't do that.                But if I were a Member of Congress, and never thought about the issue, which I think this void in the statute suggests, I might think it would work out better if we left it up to each State to do it whatever way they wanted here, if we left it up to the Department of Education to promulgate whatever rules they wanted.        Now, couldn't we hold that?           Well, you haven't suggested leaving it up to each State, because you're suggesting a uniform rule.             So, what -- how would you have it?           Oh, it's just --           -- a default rule.           All right.     If it's just a default rule, that's a big improvement, because any State can do it any way it wants.           But then, why not, here, send it back and say that the ALJ tried to answer the wrong question?          He tried to answer the question of what was the Federal law, but what he really should have done was ask about what's the State law.                 And if he has a hard time figuring it out, perhaps he should look at that evidence harder and see.            Maybe --            No, but I've never heard of a State without law.              There is no --            -- black hole in the law --            Well --        Why?     Why should it be?          I mean, that's very interesting to me.                     Why shouldn't the law be such that particularly -- you have evidence on both sides and a neutral decision-maker who sits there -- that it encourages that decision-maker to decide.                 It's one thing if the record's blank.                But not where they have a lot of experts.           Decide.    Don't retreat to something like announcing, "Oh, it's in equipoise."        All right, but then to do that is not really to look to the interests of the child or the board.       I mean, it is to allow a sort of doctrine from left field, nothing to do with the merits, to decide the case.
04-712 +++$+++          I've never heard of that.         I thought, if you sue A, and then it turns out A doesn't own the building, well, then you've got to sue B.         And you didn't sue B.         Well, that's too bad, that, unfortunately, if you don't know who owns the building, it's going to be hard for you to bring the lawsuit.         But we had, I thought, like, pages and pages of discovery rules and -- I've never heard, before, of a lawyer who has a -- you know, in this kind of situation, can't find out who owns a building there.           There are records, there are all kinds of things.       I've looked through the appendix, actually.         I read the joint appendix, insofar as the opinion cited it.                And it cited, in the opinion, several -- five factors -- and I guess there are no others, though you can bring them out if there were -- that supported you.                   And the only two that seemed to say that it had something to do - - that seemed to have anything at all to do with suggesting that there was no diversity -- was Mr. Fred Chaney, which said that it was a partnership and not a company.        I read that.          That didn't seem to me to be what he said.            And then somebody called Mr. LeBeau, who said that Franzen is a senior vice president and -- a Virginia resident -- and partner in Lincoln Property.         So, I looked up that, and it was on, like, page 273 and, I think, 173 there.                   And they asked Mr. LeBeau, and he says, "Lincoln operates through many different structures, and I don't know what they were using here."                  Am I right - -        -- or did I misread it?        All right.        So --        -- what is the evidence?        Where is it in the appendix?          It said that he -- you sue person X, and I take it the reason that you won this case in the Fourth Circuit -- which was surprising to me -- was that a person called Mr. Franzen, who is a resident of Virginia, was a partner of the defendant.                    Now, I would like -- and, indeed, it was a partnership of which he was a partner.           So, if a Virginia resident is a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership, then maybe you were right. So, I'm interested in: What is the evidence that Mr. Franzen was a partner of the defendant, which is a partnership?       What page --       -- is that?         Is that a --       Well, that's better than what is in the opinion.           What is it?          181.            But to get the real parties before the court, you have to sue them.            And, apparently, you didn't sue the right people until you replied to me. Then I took your argument, because it seemed like seven arguments, mixed up, and I took that argument to be the following.              I'm -- I, the plaintiff, sued a defendant, who is called the Lincoln Property Company.         Now, I grant you, there is some evidence that that defendant, the one I sued, is a Texas corporation.              One, they showed us the certificate of incorporation, or they got a sworn statement.                     Two, in my complaint, I said that's what he was. However, there is some evidence the other way.      On page 179 and 181, we have a person named Mr. Franzen who says, "I am the senior president, vice president, partner for defendant Lincoln Property Company," in which case, if that's your argument, you're telling us -- is that your argument, that there is some evidence the real defendant, whom I sued, is not a corporation, despite the apparent evidence to the contrary?       Rather, it is a partner, and Mr. Franzen is a partner in it.                    Is that your argument?       Do you want to make that argument here, or are you going to give up on that argument?            No, I'd like the -- these are very expensive, this litigation.                        You're all the way in the Supreme Court.                 It's costing people a lot of money.          And if there is a legal issue here, I'd like to find out what it is. I have exactly the same question Justice Stevens had, which is where I started.                        Do you agree that the company you sued, called Lincoln Property, is a Texas corporation, yes or no?            All right.            Then that's out -- fine, that's out of the case. The next question is -- of course you could sue a real company, called Lincoln Property or Jolly Fisherman, and it could turn out that that real company is a front, that it has no real existence, its -- all its papers and everything to do with it is signed by a totally separate corporation.              Are you saying that's what happened here?       And if that's what happened here, which is the real corporation and people in interest?            I'm not talking about burden-of-proof failure.            I'm asking you, Who is the real corporation or person in interest that Lincoln Property is a kind of sham or front for?            Okay.      Then you think --       I'm getting there.       I'm not arguing with you.          I'm getting there.         Then you think that whoever it is that they are the front for has -- is a Virginia resident.               Is that what you think?       Might be a Virginia resident.       Might be.       You think there is a real party there that might be a Virginia resident.                 And do you have any idea whatsoever of what that real party is called?       And what's the evidence that there is a Virginia resident, in there?
04-721 +++$+++        But, now, maybe I'm --       So, the difficulty      of looking to that, which may be a good difficulty -- I mean, that is a serious problem, but I thought what we wrote in the case -- see, there are two problems here. First, which was bothering me, had to do with our Court's relation to the Ninth Circuit, which may be simple and -- as far as legally is concerned -- but I'm not sure about it.           The other, which is much more interesting, is what you're talking about. All right, now, on the first one, I read the words.        It says the words "on the merits."                 The Ninth Circuit thought those three words meant that the California Supreme Court could not have considered the petition too late, for, after all, it decided it on the merits, just as with the cite.                  Now, whether these words are right or wrong that follow, that's what we wrote.        The next words were, "There are many plausible answers to this question."                Sometimes, a court addresses the merits of a claim that it thought was presented in an untimely way.                 Why?        Because they don't present any difficulty, and the timeliness issue does, or because it wants to give the reviewing court alternative grounds for decision, or maybe it just wants to show the prisoner we thought about the claim on the merits.            He, after all, doesn't have a lawyer. He gets a postcard.            That helps him.             So, there are a lot of reasons.           And it says, "Conclusion."              Given the variety of reasons why they might have put the words "on the merits," the fact that they are there, those words cannot, by themselves, show that the petition was timely.        So, then I read what they wrote.            What they wrote is, "When the California Court denies a habeas petition without comment or citation, we have long treated the denial as a decision on the merits."                   Okay? And then it cites a pre-Carey case.                  "Therefore, the summary denial was on the merits, and the petition was not dismissed as untimely," citing two pre-Carey cases. Now, I don't see how, since I just said the words "on the merits do not end the issue" -- here, the words weren't even there, but they say, "We're treating it as if they were, and that ends the issue."                  So, what do we do about that? Then the next question, once I figure that one out, is, What do we do about the issue you're raising, which is quite important and interesting and so forth?       Well, we could work with that.       Now, that's, sort of, helpful, because if they say "most are timely filed," then the next question would be, "All right, what period of time is it?"       You'd have to get some professor to go through these cases, and they could -- they could figure out how long it is.                  What do you think it is, from your experience?       But, I mean, is it more like a month, or is it more like 3 years?            Because?            So, there's a special reason.        In your case, is there really a year that isn't explained at all?            Because?            No, forget that.      The library, I'll give you.                What's the rest?           But -- well, did your -- did your client file an affidavit or something saying he didn't have access to the library during the whole period of 3 years?           Well --           -- is there anything in the record that says, during the year after they said, "We'll change your job so you can get access to the library," that he didn't have access to the library?           Well, all right, so what's his reason for saying that, "Last year, I was not able to file a petition in California Supreme Court"?            So, what does it say?       What does he say?              Go ahead.       Now, the --       -- the next thing, what he actually says here, is that the C facility where he was confined was put into lockdown clearly into February 1997.       And this is all after he got access.          Then it remained quiet and lockdown free until August 11th, 1997.       So, that seems six months, on the most generous interpretation --       -- where he's not in lockdown, and he has access to the library.        About six months.       So, here we have 180 days -- 180 days, twice 90 -- with no excuse at all presented.         What about this?        You might lose under this, but it -- see, so you say -- look, in every other State, the time for appealing from an appeals court to the State Supreme Court, asking them, is 20 days, normally, or sometimes 30.                   So, if the Ninth Circuit gets a case in which it was longer than 30 days, then, irrespective of whether they say "on the merits," whether they cite a case, whether they don't say anything and just have a postcard, what the Ninth Circuit should assume that they've done is consider it untimely, in the absence of the kind of excuse that the California Courts might accept as an excuse.                   So, then they'll look into that.                And if California, in the future, wants something different -- which I'd be surprised -- they will say that their system means that a 3-year delay, or whatever it is, is actually timely. But, in the absence of some reason to think that, why not use the words, which would give you a chance to go back, and you could say, "This is not a case of total lack of excuse.             There is excuse of the kind that California would accept."         And -- now, therefore, think not of if you were arguing Carey v. Saffold afresh, but think of the words that are actually written there. And now think of what happened here.                        And now propose something, please, that will, in fact, deal with the problem that this case seems to present.
04-759 +++$+++         Well, I mean, that might have -- you might have won if they had said, "We're going to look to see what the law is in Arizona governing a private person who performs a similar kind of inspection.               And we decide that it's the same."              You would have won that, I guess.        But you didn't, because they didn't.       That isn't what they said.        That is, we're not looking to the law governing private persons, we are just looking at law governing municipalities, and they're -- it seems to me they are pretty clearly wrong about that, unless you give me a reason why they're right.        That's a good question. Suppose you really had a person who -- there's just no comparable private person in like circumstances.                I can't even imagine what that could be.                Maybe you could imagine. But I was trying to think of some secret research on turning people invisible or something for military purposes.         I mean, I -- it's just hard -- I mean, hard here, obviously.          There is such a person.        There are private mine inspectors.        Maybe there are not --           Yes, but Louie, according to the SG, says, "We say here that this person is not liable -- the Government is not liable, because, in Washington, Washington would not make a municipality liable," while adding that the law of Washington is that a municipality is liable only if a private person in Washington is liable.       So, I wouldn't think Louie is very good authority that the Ninth Circuit thought it was for the proposition that you look not to the private person, but you look to only the municipality.           Well, I'm just --           -- reading from their brief. What they say is, the court stressed that the equivalence is important.             The equivalence of what?          Under Washington law, State and municipal government entities are liable only to the same extent as a private person.                     And they cite page 825.            And they stress this equivalence, because a finding of immunity for State employees under State law does not determine the scope of the U.S. liability, etcetera.      Well, anyway, if Louie helps something other than that, it's wrong, too, isn't it? Because what the statute says is, it's a question of looking to the --      -- private person.        That's actually a rather interesting question I don't really know the answer to. The idea is that you can't find an analogous private person.        We might have to write something about that.         You could say -- you -- there always is an analogous private person.        It's impossible to think of an example. The other extreme, you have the Ninth Circuit, which could -- which says as long as the Government was involved in regulation, there is no analogous private person, because private people don't regulate.              I would think that was almost certainly wrong. But what is the right way to go about it?       Are there such people, or aren't there?        See, that's exactly what's concerning me, and I don't quite see my way to an answer. Suppose we do send it back because we think just what you said wasn't so is so, they have to now into this.                They'll have to go into it.          Should we suggest, "Look, you try harder to find a private analogy, because there's almost always a private analogy."             Every Government official has some similarities to private people, and some differences. So, we could emphasize that, or we could suggest, "No, actually, there are quite a few differences."              I don't have much of a feeling for which way to go on that.        No, that's not -- that's not what I've been asking.        And to expose everything I was -- perhaps the better thing is to say, "There's always a private analogy," or try very hard, because if you really found an instance there was no private analogy to, maybe there would be no recovery, because the statute simply speaks about private party.        And this is a statute designed to give people recovery --        -- when people commit torts.        Yes, it does, but that -- would we end up there, because of the way the statute's written?        You avoid the whole matter if you say, "Look for the closest private person, no matter what."                    And maybe that's --
04-805 +++$+++           Yes, that's right.           Let me go back for a second. I'm just trying to get it clear. My -- my belief -- I've always thought that Citizens Publishing was a case where the district court said that the formation of the joint operating venture -- the basic formation, which involved a stock acquisition -- violated section 7.                    And then they created a decree.         And the question was -- for the Supreme Court was whether the district court was right in holding there was a section 7 violation.                    Now -- now, maybe I'm wrong on that.               I'll go back and look at it.        If so, if I'm right on it, then what we're lacking from your point of view here is a claim that this whole joint venture is unlawful.                      And I agree with you.         If you make that claim, I don't think the FTC can insulate it, I guess, unless there's something I don't know about, but you're not making the claim anyway. So here, unlike Citizens Publishing, we're -- we have to deal with this on the assumption that the joint venture is lawful.        I don't see how to get out of that, but maybe you can tell me I can.                    But wait. Now, what I'm trying to get at is what precisely is your claim, given the lawfulness of the joint venture? One part I see.      One part I see is that the people who are setting the prices are the board of directors of a venture company who represent Shell and Texaco.        Now, that might run up against Justice Scalia's objection. But I want to sure -- sure I have all of them.       That is, I want to know if there's some other claim you're making here in respect to an agreement between Shell and Texaco as to Equilon's prices.                   And if so, what is it and where is the reference in the record?        7.           That -- that might be.      But I don't want you to forget the last part of my question, which for me was the most important, because I can read Citizens Publishing, but it's going to be tough for me to find in the record any claims that you make that the two companies have agreed as to price, like the Panagra example.              That's why I gave it, to put it in your mind.         So if there's anything like this that you're claiming, I'd like to know, or is your total claim that the activity of Shell and Texaco in setting the price of Equilon is to have their representatives on the Equilon board of directors tell Equilon what price to sell?         Or is there something else?          I just need to know.          Is it just that, or is there something else in this case?         Was it the board of directors that did that, or was it something else?        Well, but that -- that sounds like the complaint that you're making.            We have a problem, say, with -- with the newspapers or whatever it is.       It's awfully dicey as to whether they should form this joint venture.            It's going to eliminate a lot of competition. But now what you're saying is, look, at the very least, they should structure it in a way that the independent pricing decision is made by Equilon.               Don't structure the pricing decision so that bit by bit, day by day it's made out by six people, half of whom represent Shell, half of whom represent Texaco.             I can see that as an argument.            This is more restrictive than necessary.        Now, you get me that far, and now I -- I -- but I say why isn't that a rule of reason because you're really fighting the structure of the venture they come up with.         Really?         Suppose we walk into a department store.             In the department store, we see three perfume counters, and there are three salesmen, one behind each.                Do they compete in price? The answer is obvious.            Of course, not.          Of course --         Yes.     Three counters.       They sell perfume.         Of course, they don't compete.         But do we know the department store has to be run that way?          I mean, maybe some places it isn't.               We can't prove it has to be run that way.         Think of a -- think of a mall.       Think of a bunch of shops.             Maybe it doesn't. Maybe they could compete. The reason that -- the law says they don't have to compete is because the law thinks in general it's a reasonable way to run a department store without forcing your sales people to compete.                 And similarly, a joint venture.         You can't prove they have to have the price set at a central place, but the reason they set it at a central place, because it's a joint venture. And that's seems to me what the cases are consistent with.       You tell me which one is it.        Oh, the answer is no. You're right.        If that were a real rule of reason argument, did you waive the rule of reason here?
04-848 +++$+++        -- that kind of thing that doing it -- that kind of thing doesn't mean to fall within the "transmission."         Now, suppose that that was the holding.         How would the Government be hurt?       What we'd look to is, you'd look to the purpose of this.              The purpose of it was, basically, I gather from the history, as recounted in Kosak -- in what the Court said in Kosak -- the purpose of this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit that a person could protect himself for the loss by registering the package, by taking out this ordinary transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do.                 So, they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery claims, all that pack -- family of things, everybody'll say, "Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check." I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up. But the Government's already liable for what I'd call the "swinging the package around," leaving it -- slip-and-fall, trucks.          So that falls on the other side. Now, how does that hurt you, the Government, if that's how we'd come out?         Well, you can't get too far --         -- with the text.    I think you have a great claim, and so does the other side; but if it's just the text, that's not my question.         The question is, If I think the text is perfectly ambiguous on this, I look to the purpose, suppose I came out the way I just said.                 How would the Government be hurt? is what I want to know.            So, if --            I take it, on your theory, that that -- there is no lawsuit.           But are -- you got the -- well, that's exactly the point I'd like you to hone in on, because I don't see what's -- you say, "Well, we're defenseless."             Why are you more defenseless than any other business that leaves things on porches?                    That might be, you know, 482 million apple deliverers or Domino Pizza people.        I don't know.      Or they -- they ring the bell, probably, but some -- MCDonald's hamburgers, lots of -- department stores.          I mean, a lot of people leave things on porches.           So, why are you more defenseless than they?           All right.          Well, that's --           -- that's what people are likely to trip over.             I mean, they're not likely to trip over a letter.       What about -- but I'm surprised that there's no empirical examples of what -- well, I would think it would have happened, in 50 years and tens of millions of packages, that a package falls off a truck. You know, the next driver veers somewhere and gets into an accident, and they say it was the -- it wasn't packed properly.          I think should have happened sometime in the Post Service over -- Postal Service over 50 year.                My guess is, it did happen and you just paid.        Really?        Is there any --        Do we actually know, either of us?      I don't, I confess.        Do you -- do you --
04-881 +++$+++        So, is the statute -- I saw something here, that a person who's going to get this offset, and he has Social Security, you exempt $9,000 of the Social Security, and then you limit it to 15 percent of the remainder or whatever is reasonable, whichever is less.         But -- yeah, I think he's -- one argument that they're emphasizing, anyway, is that -- you look at the Debt Collection Act, and suppose it had said the following, "Section 207 is amended, or changed, as follows.           We refer specially now -- we can collect, through offset, but only for 10 years.                     I mean, only to claims that are more than 10 years old.                     So, we are changing what 207 says for debts over 10 year -- under 10 years old, and we can offset those."                     Now, suppose it had said that.         And you'd say it's the same.         All right.        If that's the same, let's imagine this statute.               The statute says, "We bestow upon the Social Security agency a very limited power." And it says, "This is the limited power.                     The Social Security Agency may, despite 207, levy offsets on under- 10-year-old debts."           That's what they say, right in the Act.       And then, indeed, the whole point of it -- it's entitled "Limited Offset Ability," parenthesis -- "Limited Offset Ability (Extending Only to Debts of Less than Ten Years)," end parenthesis.                 That's the title of the Act, and then it says just what I say, repeating that.       But you're not going to treat that --       -- one the same.    You see, what they're saying here is -- they want to say that what I've just said is what Congress wrote in this Act.              And --       -- I'm making it harder and harder for you to accept that saying --       -- automatically.
04-885 +++$+++      I thought (b) and (c) -- tell if I'm right about this -- but suppose an individual bankruptcy, and sometime prior to the bankruptcy the individual got into an automobile accident and ran into a State building and wrecked it.   All right?     Now, I take it that, in a State that hasn't waived sovereign immunity, that individual, were he not bankrupt, might not be able to bring a lawsuit for his damages caused by a claim that the wall was too high or something.              Each is claiming the other is negligent.       I guess the person wouldn't be able to file.      And the fact that he's bankrupt, he couldn't, either.     Okay.   Now, in (b), I guess it's saying that if the State happens to come in, after he's gone bankrupt, and brought his negligent suit against him, he can respond.     So, if, in fact, you were to lose on (a), I guess the whole section would fall, because it wouldn't make any sense anymore, and we'd just wipe out the whole thing, (a), (b), and (c).     All right.    So, then the case really turns on the extent to which the Government can -- sorry, the extent to which Congress can waive sovereign immunity, as they seem to have waived it in (a), whether the Constitution permits them to do what they did in (a).      And if you win on that, you win. And if you lose on that, the whole section 106 would probably fall.      I'm not sure, because if you lose on the whole thing -- suppose you were to say Congress doesn't have the power to do anything there.              I just wonder if (b) and (c) would survive, because they may have had something else in mind.     But maybe that's too complicated to go into now.         No, no, no, he's -- so, I'm wrong. What I said is wrong.          The answer has to be that         -- we're only talking about (a) at the moment.             And what Congress tried to do in (a) is abrogate sovereign immunity insofar as it is constitutional to do so.          So, then, you say, if you lose on it, it's unconstitutional for it to do so here, but it could -- it is constitutional for it to do so insofar as there is this situation that the State brings a case against the estate, and you can do an offset, et cetera.            But it would have nothing to do with (b) and (c).           It would have to do with reading that into (a), I guess.       All right.       A light bulb went out.       Which would not?    I'm sorry.       And you have some of those.       Are you trying to get those in this case?       Oh, okay.
04-8990 +++$+++             How was -- how was that?             I thought you'd go on to say how that -- how was it?                         I -- I read that Dr. Blake said this.                       He said, look, I -- there -- there are tiny little specks of blood on the jeans and we test them.                  They were tested.       And they show that a certain enzyme deteriorated to degree X, and that's true of the test tube blood as well. Both deteriorated to degree X.                   But if you take fresh blood and splatter it, there will be no deterioration. So conclusion:           the blood on the jeans came from the test tube.             Now, you say that was discredited, but I didn't read anywhere anything that discredited it. What was the discrediting of that?        Who said?        Right.        Yes.        Yes.        Which meant what?        Was incomplete, and what did the FBI man say it was?           He -- he says it meant incomplete.            And what do you -- what did -- what did Dr. Bigbee say it --           Now -- I -- Dr. Blake, you just said, said that the word inc meant incomplete.           And you say Dr. Bigbee discredited that by saying, no, it didn't mean that.           It meant something else. What is the something else?           Means.           Fine.     Now, all right --           Fine, okay.        They don't know how much. Now, I have on page 119, which they cite, of the transcript Mr. Pruden is talking to Mr. -- Dr. Blake.       Would your opinion change, doctor, if the, quote, inc notation meant inconclusive rather than incomplete penetration?            Answer:      same difference. Question:         so your opinion would not change?         Answer: that is correct.        But it would have been the easiest thing in the world for you if, in fact, you think that this is not true that enzyme GL706BX, contrary to what Dr. Blake said, had not deteriorated in the blood spot, do a test.                  Find out if it's deteriorated or not.             Can't -- can't that be done? I mean, Dr. Blake in this part is reading his own report.            His own report says the enzyme deteriorated in the spots on the jeans, and I see nothing here that says to the contrary.                  But if that weren't true, the blood is right there, and if it weren't true that it had deteriorated, I would have expected testimony, at the least, saying no, Dr. Blake, you are wrong.           The blood did not deteriorate.            The enzyme did not deteriorate.           But there is no such testimony.                  Instead, you seem to be relying on the difference between the word incomplete and inconclusive, a difference that Dr. Blake says is inconclusive or incomplete.           What -- what is the answer to my question?           Because I do think it turns on this. A lot does.            The trial judge sat there and said this is very important.           Dr. Blake is quoting from something called part 5, which I thought was his report.                     And then the trial judge says, where did you get that idea? Where did you get that idea, that the -- that the enzyme wasn't there in -- in the jeans' blood?                     Where did you get it?           And he says I got it from the FBI report, I think.           He's not certain because he's remembering his own conclusion.                   He isn't quite sure where he got it from. And now it turns out that the inc when they -- it said inc, which he thought meant there isn't much enzyme there.           And then they say, well, maybe it meant inconclusive.           And he says, that wouldn't matter because I guess I took it to mean that too would show there wasn't much enzyme there.                Both would come to the same thing. And now, if I'm sitting there and thinking, I'm thinking, well, either there is or there isn't this enzyme in the -- in the blood that's right there. Easiest thing in the world to prove.                     And if somebody is going to dispute it, the State will come back and say, no, no, the enzyme is there.                    But they didn't. So I read the testimony and I read the fact that you didn't dispute it with any evidence that's saying, yes, the enzyme is not there.        He did?         Where is that?        Let's --        It doesn't mean it isn't present isn't quite the same thing, is it?        Another blood question because I -- the -- you make a point of the -- the sheriff having said, well, I -- I saw blood on the jeans.       So I looked at the pictures and the pictures seem to have little tiny bits of blood, while a lot of mud.      So I came to the conclusion that no reasonable person could think that that testimony really shows that the -- that there was -- there was blood from the -- from the victim on his jeans. Now, am I right about that?            You're going to think I'm wrong, and I want to hear why.        How could you have?         It's so tiny.        So overall, if -- looking at this -- and that's why I think the question about the weight to give to the fact finding is important.                  You think -- you have a theory under which he could have done it, and it's certainly possible in my opinion. But also you think, my goodness, if he did it, going and this luring of the woman to the creek -- you know, there's nothing else in the record that suggests he would plot in that way to do this. Nothing.         The husband is away at the time from the dance.       He could have done it.          They are fighting. They could have done it.            And if the luring theory correct, the motive was sexual, but the sexual physical evidence is from the husband, not from him. So the jury is brought into this on a theory that there is a sexual attack and the one -- by the defendant, and the one thing that seems disproved pretty much is that.          And now we have two experts, Dr. Blake and Dr. Bigbee.           And reading a page, which I hadn't read thoroughly until you pointed it out, I'd say they might disagree.            They might disagree.      And it's just not conclusive. So if you're sitting there, do you have to have a reasonable doubt when there's such strong evidence for both people?             And -- and the part that's bothering me -- I -- I see what that district judge said on that one point, which he may have thought was peripheral but it turns out to be quite important about when the blood spilled.            But if you look to the underlying thing and I think, well, maybe you're right, but maybe you're not right. And so how do -- how do I -- how do I do this?       What's the -- what's the weighing?          I sit there and think, my goodness, I don't know who committed this crime if I'd been on that jury.                And could -- could a person sitting there reasonably come to a conclusion, my goodness, I know?
04-905 +++$+++          This is the Robinson --       -- and to think of those words in your mind.       It's a -- it's forbidden to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.       Now, I had always thought -- and I think the Courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of decisions -- that the words "discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities" meant you can't discriminate in price between different purchasers of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination of price exists.      That's what I thought it meant.            And it seems to me that was the general understanding in the antitrust bar, that was the general understanding of the courts.               And either it's not permissible to give such an interpretation -- I don't know why it wouldn't be; it's literal -- or there's a good policy reason for not doing it in respect to the policy. And in respect to the policy, what worries me about the broader interpretation is suddenly doing what Volvo -- forbidding Volvo from doing what it probably wants to do here. If it wants to get rid of its dealers, it's because it wants to compete better with other brands.            And that means lower prices for consumers, though individual dealers might be hurt. So, if I'm trying to read that law consistent with 60 years of history, and the basic purposes of the antitrust law, I guess I would -- might favor your opponents in this.               I'm exposing my entire line of thought.             I'm trying to protect interbrand competition, why -- while, at the same time, not being -- not being unfair to the purposes of Robinson-Patman; and, therefore, I'm reading this fairly literally, as it's been read.       So, what's your response?      No, I said -- I said they -- in -- the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination between the item, or items, the -- in respect to -- the purchase of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination existed.       Insofar as there were items, or items, purchased, there is no discrimination.           At least there is no discrimination that -- in terms of the injury of the statute, creates that kind of injury.        In respect to instances where you have a strong case of the right kind of injury, there was no purchase, defined as I just defined it.       No, let me deal --       -- with the latter.       I will say --       -- there are some items where your client bought the truck.       When he bought the truck, he got the sale, although he earned less profit.                Put those to the side.       Let's focus --       But you are.       -- on the items -- let's focus on the items where he didn't get the sale.       When he didn't get the sale, there was no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer in respect to which the discrimination existed.       Okay?    Now, it's that second class --       Yes.       Of course it's distinct.        Of course --       Oh, well, you have a --       You suggest something very -- to me, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, I think, from prior law that --      If you want to go look at this, you know, you say, all right, here's -- we should be realistic about it.    We're going to be realistic.          Realistic, they -- we're only now looking at the cases where they undoubtedly bought the item, but the profit was lower.           There's no purchaser problem.       But they got a lower profit.     And I think, there, the mine-run of cases is against you that that counts as an injury.       Yes.   Yes, but it's -- you know, it shows that they're going to be hurt, that they may be driven out of business.       Indeed, the market in -- the dealership market, whatever -- if that's a separate market, which it might be -- becomes more concentrated, and the result of -- you know, I could make a -- tell a little story there that would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust law.     So we follow that approach in this case and say goodbye to Morton Salt, because Morton Salt, after all, was a case that was quite formalistic.        It didn't really look to the injury to competition in a market.          It had a formalistic slogan that would, in fact, be a proxy for that.       So, what do you think of that?     We follow your -- we follow your advice, we say, "Okay, we're going to be very realistic in the future.                Forget the presumptions. And, court, look to see whether competition, in the sense of increased concentration through people going out of business, will lead to higher prices with the ordinary antitrust proxies there."      What about that?        I mean, I don't know if you -- you know, I --           -- I'm being a little --
04-928 +++$+++           But under --          -- Oregon law, what is not clear is -- you want to put the mother on the stand.          Now, do you want to go into anything at all that wasn't raised at the trial?          I mean, that --          That's right.     So --          -- that's why I want to know that.       That's what's ambiguous.          Look, you only get to go into something if it was not otherwise -- if it is otherwise relevant; and, therefore, if you want to. The reason they think it is relevant is because of a constitutional holding of the Oregon Supreme Court. So, if you want to go into something, we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant.                 If you want to ask the same thing, that's just a question of whether you have to have a transcript or a live witness.         And I don't know that that's a question that depends on their constitutional holding.                  So, I want to know, Do you want to go into things that are not there in the original trial, yes or no?          Okay.           Now, that doesn't mean you can't say yes or no.             You can decide right now.          So, decide.        And I'm -- I will be bound by the answer, as I think we all are.             And if your answer is, "Yes, I want to go into otherwise relevant things," I'd like to know that.       And if the answer is no, I want to know that, too.           No, if you pass -- if you pass, I will think you do.                 And as long as you do, I think we have to decide whether it is, or is not, otherwise relevant.             I'm being totally open and honest with you. [Laughter.]          Now, I'm not being tricky about it.         I want to know if we have to go to the words "otherwise relevant" in the Oregon statute -- "otherwise relevant," particularly in respect to this question of residual doubt.          I really would like an answer, if possible.          Right.      And they said that relevance is -- of residual doubt is relevant.                  And the reason that it's relevant is because the Constitution of the United States requires the jury to hear it.          That is what I am focusing on, and I want to know if you want to go into "otherwise relevant," for that reason.          Okay.      So, let's go to the constitutional --          -- issue.         Now, let's imagine we have a trial.               And at the trial, we have a lot of evidence about the alibi.          And what the State Court says, "This is our law.              When a person is" -- now go to the sentencing phase, the jury has heard it --          Okay?      So, they take it into account.         And, moreover, we tell them they have to consider it.          Okay?      That's a State law. Now, what happens when there's an appeal in the middle, and now we go back just to the sentencing?                      Here's what we do.       We introduce the transcript.                 And, moreover, we introduce some live witnesses to say what they said before, but nothing else. Now, you're saying there is a constitutional right to present an additional witness on the matter that has already been litigated to go into things that were not there in the trial before.            Now, my goodness, if you had real evidence of an alibi, why didn't you put it in the first time?              And if, in fact, you -- it's not such good evidence, and so forth, why does the State have to waste its time to hear some more about the alibi that you didn't put in the first time?                     I mean, you know, that's what you're saying the Constitution protects. I'm being a little skeptical.                   I want to know what your answer is.            No, I'm agreeing with you --            -- insofar as you have a right to put in what you've put in the first time.            I agree with you on that one.      But you said you wanted to do something else. You wouldn't say, "We don't want to do something else." You --          -- want to do more.          And, in the "more" part, where does the Constitution protect you?                     I'm willing to, at least hypothetically, go with you on the protection for what they already heard.          What about -- what about -- for example, the single most important feature leading juries to recommend against death, apparently, from the studies, is their residual doubt.                   Every juror who hears sentencing matters directly after a trial automatically takes that into account.                     Therefore, those who are resentenced and have a new jury should have the same kind of right.                 Otherwise, it's cruel and unusual. Now, I made that argument.               You didn't make it.         But it seems to me that there are several arguments that you might make in favor of the Oregon Supreme Court's approach if, at least, you concede that it is up to Oregon to control, through its evidentiary rules, whether a matter is relevant, what form it comes in, et cetera.
04-944 +++$+++         Was there an allegation that the company, petitioner, or whatever it was -- that they violated the act?        All right -- I guess that -- they must have thought that there were 15 or more employees because otherwise you wouldn't have.        Was that denied?        You denied it.     Then they presented evidence, and their evidence was A, B, C, D, E.     And I guess then you presented some contrary evidence, and you didn't present any evidence that he wasn't an employer.          So I guess the odds are he was.        And if the odds are he was, they win in the absence of any evidence.        Then I guess maybe you could have appealed on that point.               So did you?        Then I guess it's waived unless it's jurisdictional. 	 So we're back to the jurisdictional question.        I never heard of a point on the merits that if you -- you think you're right.              It's right on the merits, the element of the offense.              You don't think they proved it, but unfortunately, you don't raise that in the appeal.        And did you win or lose on that?
04-9728 +++$+++        But what do you achieve by this system that you have that you couldn't achieve by a system that more carefully worked out the rules and conditions of a random search?               I mean, rules, so that you avoid the totally discretionary element.                     And if you want to have management consultants, as I was imagining, have 'em.           They're not just going to tell you, "Go and ask anybody to search anytime he wants." They'll have a system worked out.                  So, why not at least require you to think it through that much?                 And, otherwise, it is unreasonable.       But the reasonableness here would be unreasonable, unless there are some checks. We're talking about suspicionless searches.                  And you could have checks.        But what about saying -- why is it reasonable to do it without any rule-based controls on the behavior of the police?              That's the question.        Okay.      But what interest does it serve not to have some rules, manuals, regulations that help make sure it really is random, or help make sure it isn't harassing, or help make sure that it's serving the very ends that you hope to serve with the suspicionless searches?
04-980 +++$+++         The word "special circumstances" is ambiguous, because it might refer to something in the world, in which case it's about evidence, or it might refer to something in the law, in which case it's a statement by a prosecutor to look at some of this evidence and give it some special weight.                Now, that what's confusing me throughout. As I understood this area, to go back to what Justice Scalia was saying -- no, wait, just -- I'll back up to try to get you to correct my misunderstanding -- Zant is the key, because Zant says, "Judge, if you have a 'non-weighing' State" -- that is, everything's relevant but the kitchen sink -- "the fact that the prosecutor made a mistake at the eligibility stage by including something he shouldn't is beside the point."                Is that right?       Fine.     Then we look at Stringer and Clemons, and they're making exceptions to Zant.                   And they're making exceptions for "weighing" States.                   So, even if the evidence in all three cases is identical and it made no difference to the evidence -- that is, to what really happened in the world -- still, says Clemons and Stringer -- still, you're not home free yet, State. Rather, you have to back up and do harmless-error analysis. So, the answer, I think, to Justice Scalia, if I understand it, is, Justice Scalia, you may be right, maybe all this is harmless, but we don't have before us the product of harmless-error analysis, because you didn't grant cert on it, among other reasons. Now, if I'm right so far, and if we want to straighten all this out, why not go back and say all three cases are wrong?          What you really ought to do is say, "Court, always conduct harmless-error analysis.                 Conduct it whether you're in 'non-weighing,' conduct it whether you're in 'weighing.'           We'll simplify." Now, what would be so terrible about that?        Then we would not have this crossword puzzle, which probably only five people in the United States understand, and the worst thing that would happen would be, you'd always conduct harmless-error analysis, and thus, if Justice Scalia is right about it, you would lose, and if -- because it would be harmless -- and if he's wrong about it, you'd win.           Yes, and I can imagine, in "non-weighing" State, a prosecutor banging on and on, at the eligibility stage, on factor X, and really fixing that in the mind of the jury, and it turns out that factor X is not an aggravator.             Now, the jury might have been prejudiced. And I can imagine, in a "weighing" State that, because the evidence is the same, and because there were so many factors just like it, the fact that they used the wrong factor didn't really make any difference. So, it seems to me the lineup between harm -- real harm in a case, and weighing/non-weighing, it doesn't line up terribly well.               But you have the experience.            And that's why I'd like your reaction.            Yes.     Yes.     I mean, a serious effort to go back and say, "Look, harmless error throughout."              I mean, I'm pushing the same thing I said before.            Yes.
05-1056 +++$+++               Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office --              Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and this patent is written very, very, very concretely and specifically.   Gets on the phone, phones somebody in Germany and reads it to him.             And that person, having an excellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the precise instruction necessary to change the machine around or put various things into it.                    So now it is a precise copy of the machine in the United States.               Is that -- how is that different from this?       How is it different?             No, no.          We have a genius -- we have, as they used to have to get all the stuff that we stole from England, with the -- with the -- remember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners and so forth?    This genius comes over here; he looks at a really complex machine; it is now stored in his head, the precise details that nobody else could do.                     He runs back to Germany, and he builds it.                  Well, he has absolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex details of this machine.             Now, does it matter, if instead of sending the individual, we send the machine to Germany.    This genius looks at it in Germany and there he makes the copy.          Are they any different?              How would you, how would you -- go back for a second, please, because, if you're finished with that, because I don't see how to decide for you without at the same time permitting a person to walk over to the Patent Office, to read that application and the description, which after all at least can be a very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in Europe.    They then make it.           And that on your reading would violate the statute.           It can't be right that that would and you don't even think it would.             But is there any precedent for that sort of thing?         That is, I understand your point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to come down to the fact that this very, very complex and detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set of numbers.    And I can understand how the patent application does not itself contain that set of numbers, but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate that set of numbers. But I then would be quite frightened of deciding for you and discovering that all over the world there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of information themselves and alone become components.            So I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field analogous instance where the transmission of information has itself been viewed as the transmission of a component?             Well, sure, there is.     It's a bigger --             But it's totally different in that of course it violates the patent in the United States.   The whole question here is whether or not the person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can do or not do.    And the -- the concern that I'm worried about is in the future it might be outside your field, it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the transmission purely of information is the transmission of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that detailed information abroad.             Then suddenly it's our patent law and not the foreign patent law that would govern.   That's why I asked for precedent.
05-1074 +++$+++              Justice Brennan's opinion sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the mistake was that the company made here is that they didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad act, and they were trying to eradicate it.             That's another part of the case that's part two and part three about the evidence that came in.       In fact, there are about six other parts.   I'm just talking about part one.           Yes.       All right.   So I read that.    Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit analysis here.    If we follow the other side's rule, it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies, whether there's a practice or whether it was a discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple.                 But we do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of things.   And we have heard them explain why there is a distinction.    I'd rather get to your side and then you can attack both, or whatever. Your side of it, it seems to me, if I agree to you, I now have to create in the law some kind of thing that sounds very complicated about whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get eradicated within the last few years, or was a totally discrete act, and therefore, had no implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get eradicated.    That sounds hard. And the second thing I guess I'd have to do is to create a lot of tolling law because there will be probably a significant number of circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and all she does is for the last six months get her paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a year for her to find out.          And we are going to have to toll, aren't we? So I have, legally speaking, a complicated tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your case.   I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore which is pretty hard to do.             But on the other side, they are just saying, go with the flow.                 Nobody is really hurt, because the employer has to worry about all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act.                 I'm giving you that summary so you can just shoot it down.           What would you do on the other side of this?     It if you win on this, then don't you have to have a fairly relaxed standard of allowing the woman, tolling or something, when she just gets some paychecks that would take her a while to figure out that these are really reflecting some old discrimination and she doesn't know.                   It's different in that respect from the promotion itself.           Well, she knows this. She knows that, all these boxes on her paychecks and she's not quite sure what they mean.                   All right, your answer is not much different.
05-1120 +++$+++                On this particular issue, the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32 pages.   Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with whether they have statutory authority.                    And of the 10 that deal with the issue we're talking about now, five of them give as their reason that they think that the President has a different policy.                  Of the remaining five, two more consider international aspects of the problem and how you have to get other countries to cooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in light of these considerations, we decide not to exercise our power. Now their claim with respect to that, is that at least three of the four considerations are not proper things for the agency to take into account: namely whether the President wants to do something different, whether we're running foreign policy properly, whether cooperation with other countries are relevant to this particular issue. So what they've asked us to do is send it back so they can get the right reasons.                   Now -- if they want not to do it.      What's your response to that?              The reason it depended on that is whether or not these other, improper considerations might have influenced the ultimate decision not to go ahead.              When I write an opinion -- when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words: "We decide this matter in light of the following three factors taken together."         And I guess a lawyer who said, "one of those factors alone the Court has held justified the result all by itself" -- in saying the Court has held that, I guess that wouldn't be so.                  That would be a bad lawyer, wouldn't it?              If they write that all of these considerations justify our result, again, one of them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have been sufficient.              Suppose it is not greenhouse gas.     Suppose it was Agent Orange.                  Suppose there a car is coming down the street and it sprays out Agent Orange.     And I come into the Court and I say, you know, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with cancer.   And the reply is, well, we have some scientists here who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent Orange is only 1 in 30.          Maybe 1 in 50.           Maybe 1 in a thousand.     Maybe 1 in 10,000.            And therefore, you have no standing to require the EPA to regulate this pollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all over the city. Now, would you say that the person who's made that claim has no standing?              I was only addressing, using that to -- to address your problem that the chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the material that comes out of the truck -- the CO2.             Suppose others cooperate? Suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol might be a good idea, and before you know it, they decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an impact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved.                 Now why is it unreasonable?      Why is it unreasonable to go to an agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent, and now we're going to go to a different agency like NHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal. And there are like not a million things that have to be done, maybe there are only seven.                 But by the time we get those seven things done, we'll make a big difference.    Now what is it in the law that says that somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want you to do your part?        Would you be up here saying the same thing if we're trying to regulate child pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a computer can get pornography elsewhere?                      I don't think so.                So they couldn't have gone in and asked for ozone regulations, because that requires other countries?            Or what about dumping heavy metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because of what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate that.   Acid rain they tried to regulate.                     You're saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.              But you are saying if Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2 right in this statute under ambient air, and they say anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do that, because it's Article III we're talking about?             I'd like you to address that.   You said there was a lot of legislation in Congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with serious regulation by the FDA.                And in this case, I don't think Congress is opposing the notion.                I don't know anybody there who's in favor of global warming. And it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is actually, that would be significantly interfered with by the EPA trying to do its best to deal with this problem. Or am I wrong?              What articles would be --              Is there anything in the statute that prevents them from consulting with other nations or prevents the government from doing that when they determine how best to work out whatever standards or other forms of regulation they want?              Do you think they have a good reason, yes or no?        Because I'm not an expert in foreign affairs.   The EPA probably is more than I am. But do you think that if they do rest their decision on their analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper basis for an agency like the EPA to refuse to regulate?
05-1126 +++$+++             If my case, the gasoline, oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, and they didn't cut their prices.                 Complaint?             Well, then that's the economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this economy.   Every firm in a concentrated industry engages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism, and I know there are economists who think that that should be the case, but I thought the law to date was that the Department of Justice is not given by the Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire American economy.    But if we accept your view I guess it is.             Ordinarily, if you take that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman Act section 2, then we have that radical change that many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that half the economy is in violation, because in any concentrated industry, after all, it is in the interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large market unless he knows his three competitors will also keep prices up.       Now, you have to know that or you'd cut them.    And that's called conscious parallelism.    And I had always thought that this Court had not said that that in and of itself is a violation of the Sherman Act.           I know that, but if in fact all you have to do in order to bring a price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege conscious parallelism and then add without further foundation, and we think there was a real agreement too, but there's nothing other than the conscious parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I said, with the exception you might not win at the end of the day.    What have you is a ticket to conduct discovery.    Now, that's what's bothering the Department of Justice and so I'd like to know the answer to that problem.            I'd also like a clear answer, and I would like to go back to Justice Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're thinking there.    We have three steel sheet companies in the United States, no more.               They sell at $10 a sheet.   One day we have action in the case, a memo to the president of the company.              He says Mr. President, if you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more money unless the others go along.                 And if they get there first, you will lose money.                 So whether they cut or not, you'd better cut your prices.                 Reply from the president:    But if I don't cut my prices, they won't cut theirs, and we are all better off.                 That's your evidence.    Do you win?           There is no depend. That's the evidence.       Do you win?           All right.          And you cite Matsushita for that?           If you're right, then I guess we could engage in this major restructuring of the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been recalcitrant.           Well, because we have concentrated industries throughout the economy, I guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an executive in such a company, at least they teach that at the schools of government, and people who aren't really experienced in these things, but --              Okay, fine.         Now, let's forget my immediate disagreement or not.                   Let's say I agree with you on this.          Now we have our example right in mind.     What other than the parallel to my example could one reading this complaint think you intend to prove?
05-11284 +++$+++               If the question is one of the evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error question rather than a question of whether the jury can give it effect?              The likelihood of?              Well, constitutional error is --              Yes.              All right.        So if the evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent you from considering it, then it's precluded.                  But if the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.              So imagine you're a juror and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his dangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think he did it deliberately.        And then you think to yourself, well, could I consider it because it shows a bad childhood and that is deserving of a life term?                  I'm not sure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that purpose at all?   What's my answer under Texas law?              No, no.          I have gotten -- I've finished considering it for future dangerousness. No, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous.                     Now I say to myself, can I consider it for the purpose of showing a bad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like?                     Can I consider it for that purpose?              What's the answer under State law?              The answer is no.              The answer is yes?              I'm not talking about future dangerousness.       I'm talking about -- I would be repeating myself.    You've taken that, I'm not talking about future dangerousness.              The jury's decided that matter in your favor.        I'm saying does Texas law allow -- you understood what I said, didn't you?              All right, and the answer is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?
05-11304 +++$+++              It's a question of waiver, part of it.       I mean, that's -- it's well established that, I guess, I mean, if a State waives an adequate State ground by considering the Federal issue, the Federal courts will go into the Federal ground and they can't later, can they -- is there any case you found anywhere -- I haven't found one -- where say any Federal court considered a State case where the State went into the Federal issue, the State had said nothing about a State ground, and then after the Federal court's decided it somehow the State got a hold of it again and they this time said, oh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the State ground here.      And is there any case that you found like that which says that was permissible?           Okay, there's no such case and therefore this would be the first.           Right.           No, no, no.         I'm saying the State typically decides against the defendant. They decide against the defendant on a Federal issue. There's a perfectly adequate State issue.                  It's called failure to object, and they don't mention it. I'd be repeating myself.          Are you following what my, my -- and I'm saying is there any case you found anywhere which says after that occurred that the State when it gets a hold of the case again can say, oh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate State ground, bad luck?    I've never seen such a thing.                I doubt that you have.           And I say this would be the first.            I'm making a mistake here.   I thought that the reason they bring in the Almanza standard is, as I put it before, a kind of act of charity.   That is, since there was no contemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't get any appeal normally.         But we'll let you do it if you can show egregious harm.             I'm wrong about that?           Speaking of that case, can you give me any citation?              And just give me a citation, and here there may not be one, but you give me a citation where Texas previously said that a defendant who raised an objection before trial to the application of the statute to his client, he said it's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give me one example in Texas law where that was raised and the State appeals court of any -- at any level said, I'm very sorry, you can't really appeal that because you should have said it again during the trial.           In other words, there's no case, there's no case in Texas law which says what I just said?           You can't say.             I thought it was because he didn't raise it again in the trial.             What is the argument?            In, in this case suppose the following circumstance.              Suppose a Federal court has decided in the case of this defendant --            -- there was an error of Federal constitutional law, search and seizure or confessions or something, and now we send it back. And let's suppose further the State has no independent State ground, they are not trying to make the argument, whether or not they're trying to make it here.    There's no independent State ground, no objection to problem, nothing.               Now, I read that one standard that could be applied is the structural error standard.    A second is a harmless error standard.   But I've never seen a case, but that's perhaps my ignorance -- -that's whey want you to show me -- where it's definitively established by a Federal court anyway that there was a serious Federal error, I've never seen a case where this Court said, or I can't recall one, that the State applied yet some third kind of standard, such as, well, I know there was a very important error, I know it was Federal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not going to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely egregious harm.     I've never seen that in the law. Now, can you point to me in the law where, which will correct my lacuna?              Have you ever seen it in a State?   Have you ever seen a State which gets a case back from --              Where?         Where should I look on that?              No, no.             I'm not talking about that because obviously they can do what they want, I think, in the State courts, but they might violate Federal law if they do it.                   And now so what's happened is somebody has gone into Federal court or this Court and Federal court or this Court has said: Here's a Federal error, of course you're free to apply harmless error or whatever, you don't have to let the person have a new trial or let him out. But I've never seen an instance I can think of where, that having happened, the State then applied yet some third standard like absolutely egregious horrible harm or not totally wonderful harm or something like that.         I've never seen.          That's what I'm looking for.       Is there such an instance?              Yes, that's possible.             I guess the reason would be that there is a problem with enforcing Federal constitutional standards.            I have not heard of a State that says, suppose the jury was chosen in a racially discriminatory way, suppose there are all kinds of things, the State says, well, we admit, we admit that there is this violation, but we're just not going to apply a harmless error standard.               We're going to apply a tough one.               I guess that would be the reason.     That's why I don't think I've ever seen it.
05-1157 +++$+++               Well, it might well be, because the reasoning would be, which I find very strong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an antitrust court in, you're talking about juries and treble damages.     And as soon as that happens, the people who are subject to it stay miles away from the conduct that, in fact, would subject them to liability.                 And yet staying miles away, they will not engage in conduct that, A, the SEC might believe is permissible, or, B, actually favor. Where you get a complex complaint like yours, that begins to ring true, that argument.                 And that's what's concerning me.               What they say in respect to that is the other side says it's common to try to what's called make a book or something.                 I don't know these terms.               And when they do, what happens is that the marketer goes out and he asks people:    What's your plan?          What are you thinking of doing next month?     What's your plan for this stock? Hold it?     Not?   It doesn't require much imagination to see how certain answers to that kind of question could be brought by a plaintiff in perfectly good faith as evidence that there's an agreement that next month they will pay more for the stock and next month they'll pay a lot more.              The problem -- I'd be repeating it.    we're not talking about, say, your case. I don't know what your evidence is.                       But let's imagine a case where the evidence of just what you said consists of some rather ambiguous discussions which might be characterized in a variety of ways, including the way the way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who would repeat the very words you just said. Now, the issue, it seems to me here, is in light of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge to say whether that's so?           I know you do.           Or do you want the SEC to say whether that's so in the particular case?   Or that's why I thought of primary jurisdiction: Maybe first send it to the SEC. What's your view?              What about an agreement among underwriters, among underwriters, which says the following:    We agree that we go -- when we go on our tour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers whether they plan to hold this stock for at least a month.             No problem.             How do you know that isn't a disguise when they say --             Ah, ah.          What they've said was -- you see, they have the same allegations.                     I don't know how to -- you see what I'm driving at?             What's the answer?                Can you get damages for that from the SEC?       I mean, it sounds like bad conduct.                Suppose you lose, your client -- suppose all these bad things happen and you don't have an antitrust claim.                 Is there somewhere in the law that you can get damages?             So what's at issue here is not whether you get a remedy.             It's whether you get treble damages.             All right.       So what are the words you use in the opinion, that would separate your case, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to charge them, from the case that they're worried about, which is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation is, really involves activity that could be quite legitimate? Now, now -- what words would I write in the opinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep from the goats?              What about -- what about -- listen to what I'm about to say.                I'm thinking of the standard. The standard would be where the allegations are such, where the case is such that -- to go further -- that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of illegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is of longstandingly prohibited under the securities law; and there is evidence to support that, of -- strong evidence to support it, or the evidence in support thereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the jury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected. Under those circumstances there is no immunity.             I don't know if it's -- I mean, you know -- (Laughter.)             I would always -- I think the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty close to what the SG says.           And I think he says that -- that -- that Justice Alito's point, which is certainly a good point, is that you would have to allege facts such that it was clear from the face of the complaint that you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was -- that's what he means by protected -- and there's an ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out of this conduct that is arguably okay.              You, you could live with the SG --
05-1240 +++$+++               But that's the problem.        I don't know if it is easy.            It seems to me if you take your point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call it an unconstitutional action allegedly.                  So, I don't want to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and Fifth.     On January 1 the event occurs. Then you say you have two years to file your claim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for example. Then that happens.              Let's say two months later they file it.       The defendant files it.             A month after that, there is a state criminal proceeding.                  Now, you're the Federal judge.            What's supposed to happen? It sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under your theory, is going to have to make a decision.                  He's going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's being argued in my court that the policemen did something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct, that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that the conviction if there is a conviction in the state court later, will necessarily be vitiated.                  If the answer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead; is that right?                All right.       If that's correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal tolling rules. I don't see any way to get to a sensible result here without either having clear abstention rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I suggested before.    Am I right?             If I'm wrong, let me know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?                 If you do it with a stay, I mean, I see that disadvantage.                If you do it with a stay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence, think what's going to happen in the trial at the criminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then make a determination.        It sounds like a very difficult decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it wrong, sometimes they'll get it right.                    The defendant might be arguing two different things, you know, one in the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the other to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal court. What do you --             If you delay accrual by tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some instances the policemen won't know for quite a while whether the case is being brought.                  That's true; and in the other instance, he won't know for quite a while how the case is going to come out, which may be worse.                 But you don't have any uncertainty.               You have no uncertainty.    You would know once the man is released. It's no tolling.    Once he's convicted, it's tolled. Then the conviction comes in.              Not tolled until they bring a proceeding.
05-1256 +++$+++            Why, why -- why though? I'm having the same problem.              As I read the sentence that we have just been quoted it seems to me at first blush that it's completely right.            You may consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the reasonable relationship is.             Now you have to be sophisticated in this.            Don't ask me how the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered by this victim in court.      And if it's really bad, you're going to maybe have a hundred times this compensation instead of only ten times or five times. So -- we take it into account, the extent of the harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that ratio should be.   That means it goes to the evilness of the conduct.   But you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons who aren't here in court.           In other words, what you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in court, think about her suffering, which is real and serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant because of what he did to her.          Which would be a natural human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless, the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do. So reading it as I just read it naturally, it seems to describe what our cases have said is the law.   Why isn't that right?          I'm looking for a real answer to the question.        I'm posing it in a hostile way and hope I'll get an answer. [Laughter.]             I --             Yes.           Because you read it's about harm.   You say look here is the person doing something absolutely awful, I mean really awful.           And look at how awful it is.   It's the kind of thing that would have hurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them.           Now I think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say.          And as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?            The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors like that, or many do.       Alabama did.          You know, not quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you know.    And there are other cases that would bring up products liability.      And it's pretty hard to think of a products liability case where the jury found negligence, where they might not also find these factors.              Because in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the company.   Somebody will have been hurt and likely seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often is, at least in this instance.            And now you read these five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, well, you read the jury factors like that and they can do almost anything.      And it's that, it's that fact that anything goes that I found disturbing.
05-1272 +++$+++  
05-128 +++$+++        There -- there are two parts in my mind to this.         The question is what is the difference between a workmen's -- worker compensation and health benefits.         I agree with you, so far tentatively, that that difference can't lie in the nature of the contract providing the benefit.           Now, I know they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that to the side. If it doesn't depend on that, it depends on the difference between workers' compensation and health benefits.         And you want to say there isn't enough of a difference there, though they argued the mandate makes a difference.            Of course, you could mandate health benefits too, and I don't think that would matter. But if you're right, what about a -- a long- term contract for bottled water for the workers?          Well, actually -- this is -- to me anyway, this is an important point because at some point you have to draw the line between the things of a kind that workers might bargain for and things not.      Now, if that's where we're getting there, the history of workers' compensation may cut the other way.          Because?          What's -- what's the principle I'm going to use?
05-1284 +++$+++              Is this right?       If I have it -- I'm using sort of a silly example to explain it to myself.    But I'm thinking the FDA -- or no, the Agriculture Department decides they're really interested in red apples not being red.            So they say we hire thousands of apple lookers, and the apple lookers look at all the apples and they devise a redness test which is really fabulous, you know, very precise.              The other possibility is they say to the apple companies, you do your own looking.   Now I think there'd be the difference that you're trying to argue, and I don't think it cuts or you.   Because in the first case, what they've done is hire somebody to perform a governmental function.               In the second case, what they've done is to the people who are regulated and have the interest, in announcing they have red apples, they've said, you do it yourself.                 That wouldn't be relevant, because the -- the problem with the, with the approach that you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that there are probably a lot of instances where a regulated firm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market; yes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of tests to see if it is yes or no. And if you're going to start taking that kind of firm and breaking it apart to say whether it's doing the testing part or some other part, you're really opening the gates.              All right.           So what you are saying is that this function is so separable and it is so much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating it to the third party that did nothing of the testing, that even if you delegate it to the second party which does testing and then benefits from the testing, that's still not enough to take it out.              Is that -- have I got that right?              No.     But I -- so, so to use my silly example, I mean, it is like the lipstick company.    You're saying, well if they did it to the lipstick company it would be clearly that they're the Government agent.    And it is so technical, so governmental, so heavily involved with the Government for testing, that even though you give it to the apple growers themselves, they are still Government agents when they perform it.              I, I see the argument now.              Then is there any, any authority ever, that you found for that? (Laughter.)              I have a quick question. Is there anything in the complaint that alleges you didn't perform the tests properly?             Is it the apple institute who's doing the testing?             No, I said apple institute. You know, that seemed to me to be the case where it was the apple institute or whatever it was that was the delegate, and then they applied the test, and the people they were applying the test to weren't.
05-130 +++$+++        Suppose --       There isn't an automatic distinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who is licensing a patent that probably won't be developed very much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to -- I'll ask Mr. Waxman.       Why?     I mean, I think there are so many factors that could enter into it.       What I was going to ask was if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and, moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large, will not take that product and develop it further, then it's fairly easy to calculate damages. Now, couple that with a client or a patentee who also waits for a long time, waits till the invention is embedded in a series of other inventions so that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far more than this particular invention is worth because the infringer would have to give up the entire invention.          Couple that with a patent that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief, reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me, that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent their process for a supermarket.                   I -- I mean, you'd worry about that as a judge.                  And couple that with all the other things that are here. Now, special case?           Why not?          The main point -- what I was trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the patent troll case.           On that very point, my question there really was -- that was the heart of it -- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent- related value attached to whether you practice it yourself or not.             It's just that when you license it, it's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.            But it's easier to calculate the damage.              Now, at least in some subset of cases. So if you have a case where, on the one hand, it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the same time you fear that to issue an injunction will produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in the balance.            So the -- other things being equal --            No.     Willful, willful.    It wouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's willful, the reason that he might be willful is he thinks that the patentee is holding him up.
05-1342 +++$+++               That's the question I had. I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question, because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab, that those things that are preempted are those things that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.             But I thought we were basically dealing with conflict --             -- not fielding.             But -- but the last part of the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply to the parent bank.       And I began to think it fields preemption.    Am I right in thinking that it is conflict preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the case of a national bank?                 Conflict preemption basically strikes down a State law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.                 All right.         Now, with that in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 34.4(a)(B). Neither existed.              But we listened to what the agency said as a Court and they explained how the regulation worked.      Would you expect to come to precisely the same result?              Would you or not?              I know, but would you -- would you expect to come to the same result or not?
05-1345 +++$+++ 
05-1429 +++$+++                 Well, how do you avoid -- what about their statement from Collier?                No.     No.      It said -- a pre-petition claim, if a creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post-petition, they incur it post-petition, afterwards they file, after the petition they file a claim with the bankruptcy court, in exercising or protecting a pre-petition claim that included a right to recover attorneys' fees.          And they say that's what we have, we had a contract that gave us this right to attorneys' fees.     The fees will be pre- petitioned in nature, constituting a contingent pre-petition obligation that became fixed post-petition when the fees were incurred.     All right.         Now, what is your response to that?                Because?                Then you explain that to me?                Well, that's because 506 had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts how to deal with secured claims.              Of course, that is exactly what's puzzling me.      But why haven't they gone out and got?    So why -- what you're pointing to so far is that Congress has said a particular class of people get the attorneys' fees out of the security insofar as the security will support it.           It doesn't say a word about what happens to the attorneys' fees after the security is exhausted, nor about anybody else's attorneys' fees, where so provided by contract.               Colliers says they can get it.              Same puzzlement.                 Suppose I sell you a house and I make a promise that I'll fix any leaks in the bathroom.   And lo and behold, before there's a leak the --   I'm bankrupt.        And while I'm bankrupt it floods, the bathroom.   No claim?                 It is a contingent claim. And you're saying this is the same.              Well, are those 15 places -- do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative expenses?    Do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply as an unsecured claim for attorneys' fees?              What's the answer to my question?    Is the answer that 11 of them say you can collect attorneys' fees, but only as an unsecured claim against creditors.               All right, so six.               So six are administrative, and then the remaining two say that the creditor can collect it as an unsecured debt?               Which are those two?               Which is that?               That seems to cut the other way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be allowed insofar as it's reasonable.              Yes, but I mean you don't have exactly what I was driving to.                    I was quite interested that you said there are 11 other provisions that we could look at for support, and I wouldn't think it was support if those consider -- concern administrative expenses, which nobody's asking for here, they just want an unsecured claim, or if they concern some other --              -- irrelevant thing.                 How -- can we decide?         But I'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong, everybody will agree with us.               But we should have to say why it's wrong.     And if we say the reason that it's wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at all, you'll be delighted.            And if we say the reason it's wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees regardless, they'll be delighted.                  And our only other alternative is to not say why it's wrong or -- I mean, that's the problem.             You're saying this particular set of pre-petition obligations.               Collier, I think in context must be saying, you get paid the money. I mean, he goes on in the next sentence and says by the way, despite my last sentence, you don't get the money?             Oh, in other words what he implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?                Sorry, I'll --                I think your 506(b) argument, I see your point, I see your point, is there -- I mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not.                 I got that point.   I also have your point about, well, there are other references.     Now, is there any other point in the code?              How do they do it with my leaky bathroom?
05-1448 +++$+++                 What's the -- I'm trying to work this out now.      Suppose I buy the annuity for these employees from the X insurance company, all right, and so the insurance company promises when they retire we'll pay them a thousand dollars a month.                      Suppose the company goes bankrupt.         Does the, what is it, the PGPB, what do you call it, the Pension Guarantee --                Yes.      Do they pick up any of that?              They do not, okay.    So I'm trying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and it says:     Administrator, you buy the, the annuity from an insurance company, for example, or do the same thing, get an irrevocable commitment in another permitted form. So one question is when they do that the administrator doesn't have to have any fiduciary thought in his mind. The second position is -- that's their position.     The second position is, even if that's so, this is not another permitted form because a merger isn't a determination.         And the third position is, that's what we were just getting to, is that we don't see any way in which this could help the employee.               Now you say, oh yes, there is a way. Now suppose we're choosing between two insurance companies.        Insurance company A says:         We will pay precisely what is owed, precisely; we're as solid as a rock.     Insurance company B is hungry for business, so it says:     We'll give those employees exactly what's owed and we'll write each of them a check for $500.                Now, is that something that means then -- remember, this statute says you have to get what they promised them and not a penny more.     Is that something that the insurance, the administrator then has to do?               He has to take B because the insurance company is promising him a bonus?                 Well then, if not that why this?               Could you go back for just one second to Justice Alito's question, because that's what I'm having trouble with, because I think the question is what, assuming you're right on all the other points for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to the worker here?   And the answer I heard you give was the advantage is, well, maybe the worker if he goes and works in the right place will get some more money. Well, and I wonder is that relevant.                  And you told me in respect to the two insurance companies it wasn't relevant.   So if it isn't relevant in respect to the two insurance companies, how can that be relevant here, and if that isn't relevant here what is the possible advantage to the worker?              So then you're saying that the answer -- we have annuity company A and B, they're identical, the worker has a pension that promises them $1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says, we'll give you $500 extra.         Then in your opinion under the current regs and so forth, the administrator must choose that company; is that right?              I said they are equivalent in terms of -- of the security and so forth; they are each good companies and one will write out a check for $500, which is what I thought my example was.           And now you're saying under the law the fiduciary must choose the first but you're hesitating on that which means I think I don't understand it fully.
05-1508 +++$+++              Why doesn't it -- why doesn't absolutely compel it?             Where is the ambiguity, you say?             -- the 5th percentile of such per-pupil expenditure.            And that --               Now how are you going to get that so it doesn't just say just list cards with per-pupil expenditure on it, different ones and take the top five?               Do you have a lot of cards that have the same cards that have the same number?                   You have a lot --               Yeah.               And why, why don't you take the top five where we have 10 percent of the students, let's take the second five and they happens to have the same number on the card as the first five, and why don't they fall in the first 5 percent?               All right.       Forget it. (Laughter.)              To include the words per-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're saying?              How do you want to say it, per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?              Or how do you want to say it then?              What is attached to each pupil?     You say the word such is broad enough to include per-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil?              And I don't know where to look to discover if you're right or wrong.              Is there any statistical text that you could look at to see it that's the way people use the words?
05-1541 +++$+++                 It looks like it's the same in the Kreider case.        I can't tell, I don't know.                    But this case was a specific statute of limitations acted after the general refund statute, right?              And in the prior case it seems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926. I just got it out of the library.                  They give it to us, you know, if you ask them.              And it was the 1926 code and it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been brought, the suit, fairly close to when that was enacted.     And the general provision was a general judicial code provision having to do with general statute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say.                       It looks -- I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in existence.
05-1575 +++$+++              What is the standard?     I ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard previously -- I think the State was saying that the only issue that was raised before the State proceeding, collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something like that. When I've looked at this, it's on page 88, the motion filed says we have two claims.               One claim is the claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and alcohol.             Joint appendix A.     And then there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to failing to investigate these alternative sources, we also want to say that counsel failed to explore additional grounds, and that was the sister.                  And the sister was going to testify that the mother -- the foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she has a whole list of things in her affidavit. So is that still before us?                I mean, isn't that something you want to argue?             All right.             And then the claim would be this:   You want a hearing in which you're going to present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what the school says, what happened to him at school, all things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the State court, and that the biological gene.                 And you want to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this been looked into and presented to the defendant, the defendant would not have said don't present any of that, it would have been presented, and it would have made a difference. What -- is that what you want to do?               All right.               All right, with that too.               Now, what the Ninth Circuit said is, we'll give you a hearing.                  We don't know if you're right or wrong.        What's the standard for giving you the hearing?   I -- a lot of things in the law aren't always written down exactly, and I was under the impression that trial judges often give hearings on what you might call seat of the pants.                 I'd like to hear more about it.   I've been on appellate courts where rightly or wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know more about this.   I can't quite understand it.                Let's have a hearing.    And we're going to tell the trial judge to do it.              I'm not actually talking about waiver.     My question was just generally what I asked.     What is the standard there on whether you get a hearing?
05-1589 +++$+++              I'm just curious below in the opinion, I didn't notice in footnote 6, which I hadn't taken in, that the court explicitly says that you did not make any argument about underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness with respect to other organizations, corporations and so forth. Now, did -- I can't recall, I just don't recall.   What you're saying now, I take it, is that the word "election," you can't use it for elections, and elections involve candidates and they also involve ballot issues.              And you're saying that the real problem with this statute is that it throws in ballot issues along with candidate elections.              But on that first one, did they discuss that at some length in the lower court opinion?   I don't --              So this is really a ground that they haven't considered.              But this thing about the ballot issue is not there.              In fact, you want to us decide that question, and was there another one that -- you just said there were two reasons basically.              And I see that you've put a lot of weight on this argument.              What you're saying right now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the word "election."              And that has a lot of implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that has nothing to do, I think, with unions.              And the lower court didn't consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back for other things such as the State Constitution, for them to consider this matter on remand?              And I don't know, perhaps you don't know, what the implication of a decision say in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign finance law or California's or some other.
05-1629 +++$+++               So then the Ninth Circuit was wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft as the taking or exercising control over property without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent or total?   They're wrong in your opinion?              Well then, I don't see how you make --              Isn't that inconsistent with what you just said?              Why not?              I don't understand how that could be right, though.        I mean, when you joyride it's less than personal.     In other words, their definition is if you take somebody else's property for an hour that that isn't theft, but if you take it for a day it is?               They're trying to -- is there a common law, because they're trying to report -- is under the common law there a rule or any generic rule that says if you take somebody else's property for a couple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for several hours or several days it is theft?              You're saying that the rule is something is theft only if you take it long enough to deprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?              No, no, no.          Wait.   I want to know where that comes from, because I would think I have a Volvo.     It lasts for about 30 years, apparently. So I guess if you took my car for a year, that that then would not be a theft, or maybe it would be.                      Where is the source of the rule you just cited?              No, no.          I want a book.     I want a book that will tell me that if they take my car for a month it isn't theft, but if they take it for a year it is.     What book, or where do I look to verify that this is common law?           I'm not denying what you're saying.    I just want to know where to look.              But what do we do about that?     No, you have no interest in answering my question, but the question, it seems to me under the law, here is what I do -- and I'm a good deference lawyer, as you are.       I simply look at the statute.            And I imagine some very weird case that the statute could cover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or it wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing. There's no possibility in the world that applied to my client.    But most charges are simply stated in the wording of the statute.          And most judgments simply say guilty. So I say "see, you see, it is theoretically possible."    And now when you decide what really happened, Court, you're supposed to look only to the charging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it didn't.    So the whole congressional scheme is basically put to the side. Now what's the answer to that problem, insofar as you want to answer it?                Have you been able to think of any examples where a person could have been, convicted of this statute, under the statute would he actually have been some kind of accessory to another person committing another crime, and the natural and probable consequence was that that other person would violate this statute?              Have you been able to think of one?              Yes, I am.                Well then, what's an example of where you're held guilty on the ground that you aided and abetted natural and probable -- somebody did X and the natural and probable consequence was Y. Because after all, you are properly held guilty when you do an act and a known consequence is Y. So what's an example of that?                One would be good enough. The best one.                That's a known and probable consequence?    That's a probable consequence?              Well then, maybe the problem is that they don't define natural and probable consequence properly.              You're asking us to say that not only do the states have to have the same rule, but they have to interpret the rule the same way.               This would make the application of the categorical approach impossible.    You'd have to look not only to the expression of the rule of law by the state courts, but to its application by the state courts in every jurisdiction.     I mean, that just makes the whole enterprise infeasible, it seems to me.
05-1631 +++$+++                 Did Scott, know that?     Did Scott --   Do you have evidence to show that Scott knew that the underlying offense was a speeding violation?             And Scott has testified he didn't know it.             Now, do you think you can get to the jury on the question of whether he knew it.             I'd like a yes or no answer.             That doesn't sound like yes or no.             The question is, can you get to the jury on the question of whether Scott knew that the underlying offense was for speeding?             All right.       If Scott didn't know it, I mean, my goodness, then I don't see the relevance of whether it was speeding or not.                And I was with you when I read the -- the opinion of the court below.     And I read the other brief.                    I was on the other side.    Then I've been shifting back and forth.                     Then I look at that tape, and I have to say that when I looked at the tape, my reaction was somewhat similar to Justice Alito's.     And so if it's doubtful and then you can't even show that the person who did it knew that this was for speeding rather than for murder, how can you get to the jury?             That's exactly where I started.     And I wondered -- that's what I'm uncertain about the standard for this.              Because as you and the others have been arguing, if the question is one about rules surrounding the use of deadly force.                But then when I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed to me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's not the standard.     Graham is a standard of simple reasonableness and Garner is simply an illustration of that as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as applied to cars which threaten other people much more.              Well, what is the standard? Am I supposed to apply -- am I not supposed to apply Graham?              So you're saying I cannot do the following under the law, which would seem to be contrary to common sense, to say there is a big difference between a policeman shooting a person who is running away and threatens no harm to others, and a policeman using a gun -- using a car on a highway to try to get a person to stop who is threatening others.                      I have to treat those exactly as if they were the same thing.               I don't see how -- I mean, you know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see how that's the issue.       Because you say we have to assume that the Defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all that was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.               That conduct -- it could be conduct -- you could say exactly your same question, just as the Chief just said.             I mean, I don't know how to get around this.      You could say the question was, does a person who reasonably thinks he might be being pursued for a murder --               What am I -- you said factually.   What am I supposed to assume?                     You said in light of -- I mean, I looked at the tape and that tape shows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving around automobiles that are coming in the opposite direction with their lights on, goes through a red light where there are several cars that are right there, weaves around them, and there are cars coming the other way, weaves back, goes down the road. Now, what in fact -- am I supposed to pretend I haven't seen that?              What am I supposed to pretend to here?               You didn't see that?               You didn't -- I thought that -- you didn't see that?               No, no.          I -- what I saw is he is driving down one lane, what I mean by weaving, and this lane goes with me in traffic.                   And there is some cars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where the cars are now coming right directly at him.                  And then before they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and he does this while going through a red light, it seemed to me. Am I -- did I mis-see that?                 I'll go look at it again if you --              Yeah.              Well that's, that's what I wonder.   If the court says that isn't what happened, and I see with my eyes that is what happened, what am I supposed to do?
05-18 +++$+++         Would you read the phrase from the conference report as a limitation?             That is, that -- we're trying to figure out what the Congress meant by the phrase costs.              It says it means includes reasonable expense and fees of expert witnesses and reasonable costs of any test or evaluation that's necessary.          So then is that -- have the courts read that as a -- as a limitation?       Was there any opposition? Was there any -- is there any history of anyone in this Senate or the House either before or after suggesting that they didn't want to allow recovery for the expert fees?
05-184 +++$+++         It's hard for me to --        -- see that with the language of this, because the language that you're talking about refers to "such standards."              "Such standards and procedures" refer to the preceding paragraph, which is standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (a).                That military order is an order of August 31st which talks about procedures. It's not the order that sets up the commission, which is an order issued the preceding November.                 Rather, this language seems to mean what it says. But even if it didn't -- even if it didn't, wouldn't your reading raise a terrifically difficult constitutional question, if not this case, in cases that are pending right now, where prisoners in Guantanamo are claiming that they have not yet had the CSRT hearing, they're claiming, one or two, "We had it, and we're still here.       We won, but we're still here."            They're claiming, "We don't want to be sent back to Qatar."                 And they're claiming, some, that they were tortured.                 All right? Now, if we could avoid that case with your interpretation here, and avoid that constitutional question -- we can't avoid it.              So, my question is, one, How is what you're arguing consistent with the language I quoted?        And, two, How could it, if we accepted your interpretation, possibly avoid the most terribly difficult and important constitutional question of whether Congress can constitutionally deprive this Court of jurisdiction in habeas cases?       I still don't see the answer to my question, which had two parts.               As to the language, (a) which is what's cross-referenced, refers to Military Commission Order Number 1, August 31, 2005, or any successor military order.           The order, as I understand it, that's created the commission by the President, is an order which was November 13, 2001, not a successor to 2005. But leaving the language aside, what I'm mostly interested in, because I think your interpretation inevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim that it is not constitutional for Congress, without suspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the same result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a significant number of cases, even one?       I listed four sets of cases that I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2) and E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one.               And my language was designed to make you see how difficult it is.       I listed four that I don't see how anybody could shoehorn into that.        No, the argument --        -- the other side -- if you want the argument, the other side is, there are several hundred cases already pending.               And, therefore, if we accept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the constitutional argument.            If we reject your interpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of them, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be brought.         But, of course, "new ones won't" might.              And, therefore, what is your answer to --        -- the question that this is unconstitutional -- if not here, in other places?       Can I put the --       -- that issue in -- don't -- ignore my question, which is the same as Justice Kennedy's, if it doesn't help.              I'm trying to focus this. And, in my mind, I take their argument as saying, "Look, you want to try a war crime.             You want to say this is a war crimes tribunal.         One, this is not a war, at least not an ordinary war.        Two, it's not a war crime, because that doesn't fall under international law.                And, three, it's not a war crime tribunal or commission, because no emergency, not on the battlefield, civil courts are open, there is no military commander asking for it, it's not in any of those in other respects, like past history.                  And if the President can do this, well, then he can set up commissions to go to Toledo, and, in Toledo, pick up an alien, and not have any trial at all, except before that special commission." Now, I've tried to summarize a whole bunch of points for you to get at, as you wish.       Does it -- does it -- does it define the contours, along with other relevant international sources, of the meaning of the statutory words "laws of war."         He's being charged with a violation of the laws of war in both statutes, like -- what is it? -- 2240 -- 2441, in Quirin.             To get the meaning of that term, courts looked to other law.       Is it the President, and not Congress, defining the content of the law, the criminal law, under which a person will be tried?             Isn't there a "separation of powers" problem there?
05-200 +++$+++          It's quite possible no one in Congress thought about this --         -- which is common.      So if it is common, why is it that we would not use the same approach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in Kimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the contract?         Whereas here, the rights at stake are really those of the United States in that they are going to get the money.           We have a statute.          We have all those things I just listed.            It covers only Federal employees.          Should -- there are strong interests in uniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera. So what is the difference between this case, other than a technical difference?                   I concede that one. The title is not United States.                 It's Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever.         Empire, et cetera.      But aside from that, why is it different?       Why -- why?       The obvious reason for uniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether you're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia.       And it's unreasonable to think Congress would want the rights of those different Federal employees to differ just because of where they live.       And so what's the answer to that?       But I'm curious --        I -- I wasn't thinking of that kind of uniformity. (Laughter.)        I was thinking of the contract -- the contracts that the carriers enter into with the individual Federal employees in different places.        And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those contracts all read the same or they don't.                   And so far, you have found one example of where they read differently.             Some contracts apparently say when you reimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and others say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract attorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it. And I grant you that is a difference. And I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as to whether you have to get OPM approval for that difference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off, we want the same.            And also I'd like other examples. What I'm trying to do, to be clear about it, is I'm trying to see how similar this is to the instance of the Federal employee checks, which this Court many, many years ago said, when you pay your Federal employees and you write a check, it's Federal law that's going to govern the interpretation of the endorsement.             I want to see how similar it is and how different. I have two differences.             One is the name on this case is Empire, not United States, and the second difference is the one you just mentioned about may rather than must.            Now, are there others?       Well, I would have thought the issue is whether Federal law governs this --       -- and they come to Federal court. So what is clearly -- maybe I -- maybe you've -- I don't think you've said this.                 We know this. That if the United States issues checks to all of its employees throughout the country and then it seeks to recover from one of the drawees or one of the people who endorsed the check on the ground it was fraudulent, we know that it is Federal law that must govern those checks.        Right?    From Clearfield.        All right.        Now, what is the difference in this case?             In this case, we have a private administrator of this Federal -- of this -- of this Federal program.           There are Federal employees throughout the country.            They are supposed to receive uniform -- reasonably uniform health insurance, and the private administrator wants to obtain money that it thinks it's entitled to to put into the Federal Treasury.         Now, aside from the name, what's the difference?        That's exactly what I'm trying to find out.           That's -- that's what I'm -- I'm trying to figure out in my mind how close this is to the Federal Government running a uniform program.                  I mean, everybody agrees Federal law governs questions involving the rights of the United States --        -- arising under nationwide Federal programs.         And here, we have not the United States.        We have Empire.       And so how close is Empire to being simply an instrument of the United States in this respect, and how close is it to being really an independent company that sets up its own insurance contracts?          That's what I'm trying --          That's quite good.       What are you reading from?          What are you reading from there?
05-204 +++$+++         -- from the point of view of -- of taking that standard, which you agree with, I'm glad to say, apparently, and modifying it to be sure it works out the same way for both.            Would a -- I'd like you to elaborate a little because, as I understood your claim, particularly in response to Justice Stevens, you agree that if 23 violated section 2, they can't make up for it somewhere else.             You agree they can't make up for it particularly when their only way is for political reasons.         But your argument is they never violated -- that 23 as redrawn didn't violate section 2.        And the reason that it didn't violate section 2, I want to know, is what? Because you have the three preconditions which seem to be met, and then you have some kind of -- it doesn't violate section 2 from De Grandy if, despite the preconditions, there is some kind of overall proportionality.        But all that is rather unclear in my mind, and I want to know what your view of it is.           What -- district 24.       I take it -- it's a long walking stick is what it looks like. And the -- I take it you're saying when I go back to the record here, I'll discover a finding that the district court made.             They said this was not an effort to use race to district.               Is that right? And one of the reasons that you think that is because, although it's not a circle, it's not absolutely terrible.             That -- that is a supporter of the ultimate conclusion they did not use race.                     Is that right?           Then -- then if I -- if I -- so I have to go back, look at the record, and see what it says. Now, suppose I came to a different conclusion.            Then you might still win on this point if the rationale for using race to district was because we want to avoid a section 2 violation.                     And there, you would lose, however, because you can't use that rationale unless, according to Bush v. Vera, the district that you draw is, in their words, reasonably compact.         So, again, you'd have to say that this district that looks like a walking stick is reasonably compact for that other purpose.                Is that right?        Yes, so I understand that. But -- but if -- if I -- you have two bites at this apple with your reasonably compactness.                One, you want to say it wasn't -- you think this proves it wasn't to use race in the first place, but if I'm wrong on that, it's still a legitimate use of race because it's a reasonably compact effort to conform with section 2.        And is there anything I can look to to decide what reasonably compact means in that second --          Yes, 25.        On the -- either it is reasonably compact or it isn't.                If it is reasonably compact, we never get into Bush v. Vera, whatever, the Vera case in the first place.               And if it isn't, you can't get out of it by saying it's an effort to cure a section 2 violation.        Is it possible it violates section 2, the following?             We look at the map as it's drawn.       We ask the question, is there a way to redraw this map so that, say, the minority group has a more significant influence for their bloc voting, et cetera, et cetera?             Gingles.   Answer:       Of course, there is. It's the old way.             And you say, well, why didn't you do it the old way?            Well, the only reason you didn't do it the old way was pure politics and that that isn't a sufficient justification.        I was thinking of district 23.
05-259 +++$+++           Well --          It's not -- it's not -- the -- the words of the statute that I think are relevant is it -- is it -- you can't discriminate with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.           Now, the words I just cited are present in 703.        So that's the substantive offense.         Those words, as Justice Scalia pointed out and others, are missing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a broader definition than those words I just cited as to what counts as harm flowing from a discrimination. That's the statutory argument. And then you add, there could be good reason for that.          These people typically are at work and there are lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so subtle.            Well, I'd be curious.   In the -- in the Seventh Circuit, they have a test, I gather, like the D.C. Circuit, which you've characterized as broader. Have there suddenly been a flow of these claims towards the Seventh Circuit?                  Is there any empirical data that this concern that has been brought up is empirically present in the Seventh Circuit?           Am I right in thinking -- I just want to clarify this -- that in the circuit court, they applied a pretty tough standard, namely, a standard that sounds a lot like Ellerth, the Kocsis, or whatever it is?          Tangible employment actions, a significant change in employment status, hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.                   And that's basically what the jury was instructed.         And you won under the toughest standard.         So in a sense, you have nowhere to go but up. (Laughter.)         You don't care what standard --         -- for this case.
05-260 +++$+++             He just said -- your brother said, well -- because I simplified that to the ring, and he says, well, if in fact you had a subrogation right or some other absolutely clear contractual right to get repaid from the ring, you know, which is a physical thing, you couldn't -- stronger than your case -- you couldn't get it in equity.        If I really knew about the 18th century cases, I would realize that, and it's only my ignorance that and my dissent that prevents me from understanding this.       All right, fine.     Then where do I look?        What do you think --       If -- if you understand as I -- that four people on the Court took a broader view that Congress didn't want to get into this matter, and restitution is restitution, whatever it means now; but five took the historical view.               Now, if we're in the historical view, which we are, that was the majority. At that point, I want to know how you think this case should come out.         What words should be written there if I'm thinking of the next case? And after you win this case, if you do, the next case will simply be precisely the same as yours, but the lawyers, having acted 5 minutes quickly -- more quickly, will mix up all the funds.                    Now it's commingled and all we have is exactly the same with every future case that you have, and now the pension fund can't get a penny back of the money that it loaned that it should get back in good conscience.                       No doubt about it.         A promise, good conscience, and they can't get a penny. Now, you have the interest in telling me what words this Court should write, other than overrule Great-Western, that will prevent that result from coming about.             I would like to know your --            In other words, you don't care about these other --            Well, I was actually interested in what your response was because I thought you have an interest in not losing your recovery in all those other cases.
05-352 +++$+++  
05-380 +++$+++           So in terms of --           I didn't like your characterization and the Government's of the state of the record.    I asked my law clerk basically to go look up every statement that was made in four forums.                 The first was the first Stenberg case.                 Second was Congress. Third is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is the other case here.       Now, my own impression of that is if you're talking about the medical need for such a case, that is for intact D&E, that there is a risk attached if you don't use it in some instances.                The fewest number of statements for that proposition was in the first Stenberg.           More statements in Congress, more statements that you -- doctors who say, I need this procedure for safety.           There are many more in this case than there were -- in these two cases there are many more than there were in Congress and in Congress there are many more than they were in first Stenberg.           Now, if we look to the other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it isn't safe, there I'd have to say there are probably many more in Congress than there are -- who say it isn't safe, there are probably many more in Congress; and then there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly any in Stenberg, not too many.           It was against you, in other words.           Yes.           All right, so I'm left with a record where I guess you have a subjective characterization that there is at least as much evidence in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case. But Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with the finding?           My question basically I think you might have been going after is, I was saying that I agreed with you in that there is more evidence supporting your side in these cases than there was before Congress, than there was in first Stenberg.           But still there was a finding in Congress and there wasn't a finding in the Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska legislature -- what kind of legal difference does that make?
05-381 +++$+++                But even it does hurt the suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't know just as, but they are just as concerned about a group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a monopoly seller.               I mean that's pretty well established, isn't it?               No, no, Congress has actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so -- you want me to write the proposition that the antitrust laws are not concerned --               -- with the monopoly buyer who would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers, farmers?               Okay.               That can't possibly be right, can it?   I mean if in fact the object here is to strike, is -- suppose their object is what you say. Their object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the buying side over a group of small woodsmen.                     And they might do that if they drove out all the buying competitors, and now what are they going to try to do? What they will try to do if they get that terrible monopoly, which would be bad --               Right.           Drive prices way down, below what the woodsmen could get for them.                     And if that's going to have any effect aside from an income effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread line or go to other places where they have other jobs at lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the woods business and selling at a reasonable price.                     That would be an antitrust concern.               So where we are is at the problem.    The problem is the same as at the buying side. What we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad effects.    On the other hand, low prices are good for the consumer.               Here we have bad effects, bad possibilities.      On the other hand, higher prices are good for the woodsmen.         So we need rules to separate the sheep from the goats.        And the other side is proposing a rule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad conduct, unless the person who pays the money for the goods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when he tries to sell them he will incur a loss. Now I would have thought for 40 years that was a traditional idea.          If you're trying to decide whether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad purposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good purposes, then a very good key to that is do these people expect in the long run to make money out of this without driving those victims out?                  If the answer is yes; they can make money on the market, they are storing up nuts for winter.      It's good.           And if the answer is no it's bad.    That's called the recoupment test.                    I don't think that's new.     I think it's old.                   And I'm not sure what your view of it is.              -- I agree with you.           But I don't still think you can defend this retail versus maximum price restraint.          That's a whole another kettle of fish.    And what I'm interested --                   I guess my question particularly is, I propose one test not two, but it might be that my test encompasses the dollar test and incremental costs and so forth.                      What do you think of my one test?              One test is if they are not going to make money legitimately out of this in the long run, it's bad, unless they can explain it away.                   But if they are, it's okay.             Why did they say they needed it?    I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy up there?    Why don't you just prove what you just said?             Fine.       Then why do you need all these other instructions about pricing?                 I suppose the only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute as to whether it was in their economic interest in the absence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy all these logs or not.        And so it would be very interesting if you have a way of proving that they did not need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter which is likely to be disputed.              So, I think the hard thing in these cases is to prove that.                  And if you can tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an instruction something like, look to see whether they can sell them reasonably at a profit.                Or, look to see even if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could recoup whatever they are losing later.                  Or, or, and you fill in some blanks, and now I'll have some candidates for testing.              Oh.     But of course, I want to injure competition always when I in fact sell at a lower price that I very much hope my competitor can't possibly meet, indeed would go out of business.                 I cheer.   I would love to get a monopoly.                I would love to make a better product, lower prices, et cetera.                 Do you see the problem?   And so what you've told the jury there on that instruction --                 -- is that they can find this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive selling market.                 What if it were the highest cost producer?    Suppose still, they think that by buying these logs we later can make a profit when we resell them on the competitive market.                You see, the reason they're coming up with this test is they don't think you can give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think that you can produce a better one.                   So I'm listening.
05-409 +++$+++        I'm confused now.          You're saying both sides agreed that section 1447(d) does not apply?       All right.         Now, then -- then I understand that. What I don't understand is the question about something remaining to be done.               What -- what 77p(b) says is the covered class action, I take it, is any private party alleging.           And when I see the word alleging, I think you're supposed to look at the complaint to see what they allege, not some other thing about what's going to happen later.                    But you're telling me that's wrong.          And if you're right that that's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision before final judgment, that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.            Because if you're right, then this is before final judgment, it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.            That's the end of your case.          All right.        You have to disagree with -- I guess -- go ahead.                     Disagree.     I'd like to hear the answer. (Laughter.)          Yes.          Yes, which would have to be a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the plaintiff that falls within (b).       In other words, if -- I mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue in a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted or not.        They've never had an appeal.            So they get it tried.       The whole case is tried out, and then the -- some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted. But they can't decide that.              They can't decide it because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite in the same case before the case was final.       And if they don't -- and if they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say, this is the same case?           There is only one case.        It isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think that district judge was wrong.               We think that Federal district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising since it was decided after he wrote the opinion. (Laughter.)          But it's so odd.          So -- so it goes back to the State court and the State court says, yes, that's right.       We've not heard of Romania either.              It's not a country. All right.     Now, you're saying there we are for all time.            Everybody is stuck with this holding.          Is that right?      Maybe that's why I'm so surprised that such could be the law.
05-416 +++$+++            Yes, all right, but the thing I don't understand in this, which is hard -- Is there any answer to this point from the other side?                    What this statute does seem to be about is exhaustion, which normally does carry with it the notion, "If you don't exhaust, you lose."          Dozens of cases say that.        And it seems to make it a requirement, not leaving it to the discretion of the prisoner.              Well, your interpretation leaves it up to the prisoner.               If the prisoner doesn't want to do it, he doesn't do it.                He pays a price, he has to wait, but it's up to him.                Now, that's the point that is bothering me the most, frankly.         Why not?         No, no, but, I mean, that's a -- that sounds to me like a verbal gimmick, to tell you the truth.          If he waits, and he waits to past the deadline, sure, he'll put a piece of paper in, but it'll be denied.         Isn't that true?     So, I'm not counting he puts a piece of paper in, and it's -- in my way of speaking, if what's left for him to do in the system, because there is this deadline, 6 months, it's passed, it's now 9 months, so he says, "Here's my paper. I'm exhausting."        Denied.        Okay.     Now, I'd say that's -- means he isn't exhausting.            He's failed to exhaust, as I'm using the term.        All right.        Now, I want to get rid of that argument.         Use my --        -- terminology --        -- and now answer what I am, frankly, bothered by the most --        -- which is what I just said. It leaves it up to him.            Not necessarily.            That -- that's what I find interesting.             It might be, if you're representing the interests of defendants here, you'd love this to have the procedural default rule, because it will end up with the Federal judges all over the country systematically reviewing the exhaustion procedures -- or the -- yes, the remedies in the prisons.               And where those remedies are not right or unfair or too short or have other problems with them, the judges will say, "You can't have this kind of remedy.        If you want me to apply exhaustion principles, you can't do it."           And, therefore, we'll get a force for improvement.             And that's, I thought, maybe why nobody wanted, really, to bring it up.
05-465 +++$+++            There is --        Yes, but if we're trying to think of what they were getting at, it's possible that Congress was worried about organized crime taking over the pizza parlor or taking over a trades union or taking over a similar kind of enterprise.               So that's what they're thinking about. Now, if we're thinking about that, they put in the word groups of individuals because they understand that organized crime could take over a group of individuals.          Now, once you do that, you RICO-ize vast amounts of conspiracy law.        But -- but they had no reason whatsoever for doing the same thing for what we have are associations of trade unions with each other or associations of -- of corporations with each other. And to do that, adding that in when it doesn't say that, would RICO-ize, with its treble damages and private plaintiffs and everything, vast amounts of ordinary commercial activity, not ordinary only in that, but importantly, a certain amount of criminal activity like passing bad checks or fraudulent behavior is involved.             But Congress wouldn't have wanted to -- that has not to do with organized crime.                    That does not have to do with taking over legitimate enterprises. So read this, I think he's saying, to mean what it says most naturally.                   They're worried about groups of individuals.               They're not worried about groups of corporations or groups of trade unions interacting with each other. And I'm trying to put the argument the other way, and I wanted see what you respond.       You're -- you're willing to go this far with them.           You say take those words, groups of individuals, and throw them away.                  And you're saying after we throw them away, they're still covered, and the reason that they're still covered is even though the word enterprise includes any individual, partnership, corporation, the word enterprise also includes groups of legal entities, groups of trades unions, groups of associations, even without that word group of individuals.       All right.        Now, is there any indication in the legislative history or anywhere else in the statute that this meaning of the word enterprise is what is intended, that is, that this meaning of the word enterprise went beyond what it says here, excluding group of individuals?       Are there any dissents in any of those cases?
05-493 +++$+++                I don't see, anywhere in Mr. Schick's statement, at least from 165 to 170, where he says what you said he said.               Now, maybe he says it some other place, but -- I'd like the reference to it -- but I -- what I have him as saying is that -- he says, for example, several times, "The presence -- I don't suggest that the -- that the presence of religion, in itself, is totally mitigating."        Well, it certainly wasn't, in this instance.     I gather I'm right.             Am I right in thinking that all this religious conversion took place before he murdered the girl?      So, this is not a case of your trying to get some evidence that took place after the crime.            All right.           If --            -- that's right, then maybe it does more easily fit within factor (k).                     The prosecutor told the jury they should consider it, or they could.                     The judge told the jury they could consider it -- it sounded as -- says, "You take it -- this is an example" -- he says, "It's an example in factor (k)."                    Maybe he's wrong, but they certainly likely think they can consider it.                     And Mr. Schick doesn't say it's not in factor (k).                      At least, I don't see it.    That's why I'm asking.            No, no, I know the point of factor (k).    I'm trying to be absolutely certain, before thinking --             -- he didn't say it, that I've made every effort to get from you the place where -- that this -- where the defense counsel says, "Jury, I agree, you cannot put this into factor (k)."             Were his words "it doesn't constitute an excuse"?           -- "in any way."           Where?           Thank you.
05-502 +++$+++         Why can't you?    Is there any case or anything that says you don't look at the whole circumstance to decide if it was reasonable to enter? I mean, suppose I just wrote an opinion, for a hypothetical's sake, that says, look, there was so much noise at 3:00 in the morning nobody could even hear a knock and he looks in the window, sees one of the -- a kid there being held, who's obviously been drinking under age.          He takes a swing at somebody else and pokes him in the nose and blood starts to run or -- and under those circumstances, of course, it was reasonable to go in.      End of the matter.          You mean -- you mean the noise stopped?          No.     The question is whether he could go into the house, and are you saying that before he went into the house, all the noise stopped?          Okay.      So my question is I'm interested in the law of it.                  Why can't I -- what's -- what -- the -- the Constitution says reasonable or unreasonable, forbids an unreasonable entry, search. So this doesn't seem unreasonable.                    A policeman isn't a lawyer.        He just has to do what's reasonable in the circumstance.            It's a huge -- well, I would be repeating myself.        But what I want to know is what in the law makes that opinion wrong?       And there are two reasons why he didn't want to go get a warrant.                   It would take about half an hour, at which time all the neighbors are awake, and they have to lose an hour of sleep.                  And in addition to that, the underage drinking will continue for another half an hour or an hour.                   And in addition to that, somebody else might get poked in the nose.                    So those are the reasons why -- or worse.                  So those are the reasons why he thought it was reasonable to go in.       Those are the reasons why it was reasonable to go in.       Now, what's wrong with that opinion?       Now, suppose I were to say at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under those circumstances.         What I'm looking for you to do is to tell me why.        Does it say that in a case somewhere, or is that just your opinion?       All right.        Now, what I would like to know is what does it say in a case because I -- I agree, at 3:00 in the morning, it might not appear to many people to be unreasonable when the party is so loud that no one can sleep, that they have to take an extra hour or half an hour or 40 minutes to just tell the people inside the house, knock it off. Now, is there a case somewhere that says -- I guess, we could take a poll or something, but is there a case that casts some light on this?       Which case?       Was that involving a -- is that in this Court?         Yes?       And was that involving a party or noise, or what was it involving?       I mean, I wouldn't want this to be the party case.          This also involves violence and it also involves underage drinking and all three are there together. But I guess a policeman, where he sees or hears or knows a crime is going on, can take steps to try to stop it so that it doesn't have to continue. And is there any case that says it depends on how serious a crime?         Is there a case that says if it's a sort of minor crime, like a disturbance of the peace, you have to permit it to continue, but if it's a major crime like homicide, you don't have to?
05-5224 +++$+++        What do you say in that respect about the blue brief's reference to 17th century cases, the hue and the cry where someone went out and told the sheriff, help, I'm being beaten up, and that that evidence wasn't admissible?       Well, rather than build that into the law, it might be wiser to deal with Justice Kennedy's case, in whatever system we come up with, explaining it.           So what is your full explanation of the diamond necklace?
05-547 +++$+++          I'm prepared to accept perfect ambiguity here, linguistically.          And I thought of an empirical question, that you may know the answer to, that might shed some light. Now, going along the way -- maybe I'm making a mistake to point it out, if I am -- but I go to the key thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a "drug-trafficking crime"?       A "drug-trafficking crime" is a crime -- "any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act."   That could mean an act, physically, that is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor.           Okay? Felony under -- it could pick that up.           And it also could mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act.       And I could look at those words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means. So, I thought of an empirical test.           This statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years.        That's the point of it.     And the Government does all the prosecuting.     So, in how many cases where a person committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5- years minimum?     Now, if you're prepared to tell me "a lot of 'em," I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now. But if you're prepared to tell me "zero," I would say I would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along now for the first time.        And my mind is open on it.   I'm quite interested in the answer.           But if --         No, no.         We both agree.   All -- everybody agrees here.    It doesn't have to be a Federal crime.         And --         Correct, it doesn't have --         -- to be.        It could be conduct that violates the State law, but -- and punish it under the State law -- but the conduct involved would have to constitute what is a felony under the Controlled Substances --         -- Act.         A felony or a misdemeanor.         Yes.         All right.         All right.      So, I say it's suspicious.          But why not?          But 924(c)(1) says that if you have a gun, and you have a drug-trafficking crime, book, 5 years. Okay, now we go to two, what's a "drug- trafficking crime"?      It means any felony punishable under the -- under the Controlled Substances Act.             Now, in your definition, we first look to see whether simple possession is punishable under the -- in Controlled Substances Act. It sure is.    It sure is.      It's punishable as a misdemeanor.    So, it meets that.           Under your definition, is it a felony?    Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota. Okay.    So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court in South Dakota.    And, on your reading of the statute, that guy should get a bump-up of 5 years.          Because?         Yes.         Yes.         Right.         Right.         That's correct.         Right.         Right.         Yes.         But you still have to know whether that word, "felony," in (2) means "any felony punishable as a felony under the Controlled" --         -- "Substances Act."         And there --         Yeah.       You have to know the answer to that.
05-593 +++$+++            So that's the issue then. And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too complicated and probably is one that the Government should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of employment, everybody concedes it but Government.                   And the Government's position is, nothing happened.                 All right?     Nothing happened.      You say Government, would you like to argue that if something happened, and they may be able to prove something, something like a movement? No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend on any scope of employment ground.                 All we are arguing is that ordinary work went on and that was within the scope of employment.      Now, does this act cover it or not?     Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought it was a close question but you read what I thought the other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close question.    So what is your basic response to that?              The basic point I think in Wood is this.     I'm the district judge.             And the Government, you come in and argue in the alternative. Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the scope of employment and they say there is no possibility.     You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that a jury could find that something went on here that was within the scope of employment that shouldn't have.                  And if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins either because of summary judgment or because -- no, sorry.   I've gotten lost in what I said.               Do you follow it?              All right.      Good, I'm glad that someone did. [Laughter.]              I was talking really about practicality of it.     I don't think you can give me a case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government, to tell me if anything went on here that might have been within the scope of employment.            And I look at what you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't defend it.   If you say yes, you can defend it and that's going to be the end of it as long as your view is based on a reasonable reading of the record.            And as long as a jury could find that there is a view of the record such that the plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it. What's the problem?            The only problem is if you admit that you can't prove anything like that.            No, not a fortiori, for the reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the defendant the right to call in the Government to defend him no matter what he did.         The reason that Congress wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the question of the scope of Government responsibility to take away that limited determination in Westfall.                   That was the only point.     Congress could have written a statute the way.    What's your response to that?           Right, but that's the strongest argument I thought the other way initially, that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of his own.    That you resolve in a bench trial.              If the answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court anyway.    I understand that. But if you're going to take your position whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope of employment, well, then you're going to have all these things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's supposed to normally be before a jury, for example.
05-595 +++$+++                  You can still argue -- what hearsay exception did it come in under?             Adequate indicia of reliability?             Is that universal in Nevada?   I mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in Nevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in every case?               So if you lose this case, you can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even under Roberts it shouldn't have come in?
05-5966 +++$+++         That would present a serious constitutional question, wouldn't it?                   Or what -- I mean, I -- that's -- but I thought some of these questions might be in this case, but I now doubt -- I'm having doubts about that.             But suppose the State so limits the defense that an individual defendant, who, by any ordinary psychiatric test, would be viewed as seriously insane, and, therefore, not a person who is capable of being held responsible in any moral sense for the crime, is, nonetheless, going to be convicted of murder?          I mean -- and that might be -- come up with irresistible impulse, because the person is totally insane, not like any other human being.                   Anyone would normally say he lacked the knowledge of -- he's not responsible for what he does.               And then, the State, nonetheless, convicts him of murder.       If he knew right from wrong, if they -- so, I mean, he -- it's not his intellectual capacity that's wrong, it's his ability to control his impulse.       But that's not in this case, I agree with you.       But is a variation of that in this case -- namely, the variation -- but we've discussed that at length, and I take it you think that's not in this case.       But we don't have to reach that question here, in your view.       Or do we?       But if we have to reach it, this -- they're arguing we do, because they're saying the person is so insane he doesn't know whether this is a human being or a sack of lemons.                 Now --       -- he said that they didn't consider that in the insanity defense.                 And he's not attacking the burden of proof, at least not in this Court.       And so, I -- do you think we do have to -- that we have to --       -- assume that he's right on that?       What is "diminished capacity," if it is -- what is that?           But partial responsibility does not -- insanity -- they use the words "insanity" and "diminished responsibility."                    I took the word "insanity" to mean the kind of mental state that would, in fact, show a lack of intent.                   I took the word "diminished responsibility" to mean there is intent, but it's excusable.           Now, am I --
05-5992 +++$+++        It's pretty hard to read those pages as if they were anything other than what they seemed to be on their face, that he didn't worry about the Speedy Trial Act because he thought that it had been waived.       Well, then why isn't that the end of that, that the -- if you agree that the defendant can't waive it, well, the reason that he got the continuance is because he waived it, otherwise there would have been something else done and -- or at least might have been.           Suppose you ask the judge. You say, Judge, 2 months ago the defendant came to you and said, I waive the Speedy Trial Act.                    Now the defendant says, Judge, I now would like a month's continuance.             The judge says, I'll give it to you.             The opposing counsel says why.                He says, because he waived it. Now, you're telling me that, one, he cannot waive it, but two, even though the judge said I did it because he waived it, that still itself is okay.                       We go ahead and let him exclude it because the judge might have done something differently.                   Is that what you're saying?            But it's possible you could argue, looking at the record, that the judge should have tried it -- should have excluded it on a different basis.             He should have excluded it on the basis of the interests of justice, et cetera required. So what the judge said, just to make it clear, is I'm not even thinking about this different basis, though I might.            I'm doing it just because he waived it.          And now you're telling me, I take it, he can't waive it, but nonetheless, the error is harmless because he waived it, or something like that.        It's not harmless.      You're saying it's a procedural error.        So we don't say the judge is right because he waived it.              We're saying he's right because the judge made a procedural error.                 I'm having a hard time following that.
05-608 +++$+++            Shouldn't we send that back?    I mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution of the United States."        Now, I have to admit, I've looked up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a requirement.    Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the contract.    But I might be wrong about that. But you've now argued a different point.           So, isn't the right thing for us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send it back?    If you're right that they have to pay, whether they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might win.     But should we decide those grounds today?                    Why?            Let's suppose --            Well --            Will you assume Justice Stevens' hypothetical?          Assume it, take it as given.        They did put that in.      I know you think they didn't, but I want to assume it.             Now, I'd like to also assume --             The hypothetical is --             -- that they write into the contract -- the party who's the licensee says, "And we stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is invalid."    Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for business reasons.      Therefore, the licensee and the licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he can go into court and challenge the patent."               So, we assume that's written into the contract.             And now, let us also assume a state of the law.      The state of the law is that there is no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a condition in a contract.        All right? Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory judgment that the patent is invalid. On those assumptions, is there a case or controversy under the Federal Constitution?             If not, why not?            But he says, by the way, "If I win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses" --            -- "I would other have to pay." And the other side will -- or -- I was a thousand dollars, I meant 42 billion, okay? [Laughter.]            No.      Now, that's --            I'm not asking --           -- your hypothetical.           I'm asking --           -- my hypothetical. [Laughter.]             It is --             -- it is, under other fields of the law, isn't it?      I mean, I imagine that the very -- we see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State passes a law and the individual says, "Well, I think this is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to jail; my preferences are not to be penalized.                      So, my first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey it."   There's no possibility in the world that he will violate that law.     And yet, we've often held that, with regulations, you have to have the other requirements.                       You have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not just ideological, there's real harm.                      But, if those other requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where it said that there also has to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the declaratory judgment.        I've just never found that phrase, and I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.             And you say there has never been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance where, in the absence of the action, the person would have violated the law, if it's a Government law.                  In other words, if they're -- so, it's really not --           Yes.           As I think as we --           -- both know --           -- in the Government area, it happens --           -- a lot.           Yes.
05-6551 +++$+++           It wouldn't necessarily be a fact.     It could be a fact.         What it says in here is that if the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the crime, or the offender.         And in a case in which no such aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose the upper term. Now, I grant you there's some language that I -- it seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say something a little different.              But that language, if you just take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to go above the middle range, you can't, under the law. Now, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I find it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely and other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is what the majority says.         So that seems to me almost like it, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.         Well, that's critical, and that's what I didn't understand about --         It's appendix page 3 in the brief.           What do I do here?         Because the sentence I read to you seems to say the opposite.               But then, two sentences on, they list, the Federal judge is not bound by the guidelines, he must consult the guidelines.   And after they say, an aggravating California -- it says the discretion available -- the -- in California law, that may include any fact that the judge reasonably determines to be relevant.              The Determinate Sentencing Law, about an upper term, is comparable to Booker's requirement that a Federal judge's sentencing decision not be unreasonable. Well, I assumed until this minute that the first statement trumped the second.              But now when I see the court rule, certainly that court rule is possible, given that to be read as permitting them, particularly with the second statement, you could read the second statement as saying, yes, they can say a particular instance or a kind of sentence seemingly mandated at the middle level is, in this community, so contrary to the purposes of punishment that I'm giving a higher one.              To be honest, I don't know what Black means.         So what we have -- now, this has clarified it, but I don't know what to do.                 I think if I read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the California court, which is a good court, conscientious, managing a huge system of criminal law in the state, probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely and they see that those guidelines in California as previously understood were violated. And they're thinking, how do we maintain this system as constitutional.            And therefore, they write 1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it, and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it constitutional. Now, that would be an understandable judicial reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say, because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on grounds other than factual grounds related to the circumstances of the crime or offender.                   But I also have no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the California system.      All right, so now what do I do?
05-669 +++$+++  
05-705 +++$+++          Is it possible -- I was worried somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia raised, that old regulations become unjust and unreasonable.    And then I thought, no, but tell me if this is right.    That they're going to fall within 201(b) only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable. Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to find that a violation of these rates is unjust and unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that determination.   And then, of course, that determination has to be a reasonable interpretation.               In other words, it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable --         And it has to focus on the fact that their doing so will create this private remedy in the courts.         That that -- if you have that tough -- which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of a thousand different actions in ten thousand different courts and a big mess. But I mean, how much is written into those words unjust and unreasonable?       I'm certain you can't squeeze any rate -- it is not the case that any and every regulation can be -- fall within.         Yeah --
05-7053 +++$+++           Well, why is this worse in that respect?            And lots of things in the case that you have to prove may be hard to prove because it requires finding out what someone said to the defendant over the telephone, what happened 4 years ago in a room where the defendant was the only one now alive present. There are lots of cases like that. Traditionally in the law, I take it, it's been that most instances where the defendant excuses his conduct on the ground he wasn't morally culpable, mistake, accident, self-defense.                    Entrapment?    Not -- that's a different kind of ground.                     This one?   Evidence mixed. But you have to prove lots of things where it's really in the hands of the defendant, and the defendant saying I'm so innocent because I'm not morally culpable.            I was asleep.          I was -- you know, we can imagine.             So I don't see why this is different.           And that's going back to Justice Kennedy's question.                 I would look -- I guess if we're supposed to get the better rule, the first place I'd look is what did the Model Penal Code think.                      They think you should have the burden. Then I think has this turned into a practical problem in the 29 States that have had it for 20 to 40 years.       And you say we don't have any evidence to that effect. Now, I've listed about four things here that I'd like your response to.       But if we're thinking of things logically, logically you're right.                  I can see that this is in the hands of the defendant.                  But I've wondered why hasn't this turned into evidence of a problem in the 29 States.                 And the following occurred to me, which I'll put to you to see what your reaction is. The defense has to do something if they are going to put duress in issue.                   They have to get the defendant to testify.               So the prosecutor has something that the prosecutor doesn't ordinarily get.                    He has that defendant right on the stand, ready for jury evaluation.              And that is something a -- a prosecutor may want, and it's something the defense lawyer may not want.       He has to choose.            So when you get into the practicalities of it, I see things both ways, and I'd like to find some evidence of what's actually happened.         If -- if does that --         He has a few other things, the prosecutor.          He has that defendant on the stand. There was an implication that you were in Chicago at the time.         Where you on the night of such and such?         And that's an advantage for the prosecutor.            Well, that's why this is problematic.       I mean, I don't have the experience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say whether it would be one way or the other.                You're saying -- and I'll repeat that.               Is there anything at all I could look to try to figure this out?                Because I think it is a question we're supposed to get the better rule. What did the Model Penal Code authors do? Did they take testimony --       Did they have evidence or did they have -- take testimony?                Did they go around trying to find out how prosecutors and defense attorneys -- you know.           I don't know.       What about mistake?          I thought it was a deer.          And would you distinguish between instances of duress where it may a negative mens rea and instances where it may not?
05-7058 +++$+++               Basically, I mean you've heard the question and so forth.                It seems to me that my questions and certainly others were based on certain empirical premises that might be true, might not be true.   So why isn't this a question for the Rules Committee?   Why not go to the Rules Committee if this really is a burden and so forth, rather than doing something unusual, which is to make exhaustion something other than an affirmative defense, to dismiss the whole complaint, which appear to be rules that reached draconian results in a few cases anyway.             It could be, because the statute of limitations could have run.                     So it depends. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.                     But my basic question here, isn't this a matter for the Rules Committees rather than for the Sixth Circuit to go off on its own?              I think Y is Mr. Gearin.
05-746 +++$+++        I guess they want to make the argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with contributory negligence.      I don't see anything else.          It doesn't speak of causation at all.       It just says if there's some contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished according to the negligence attributable to the employee. So I take it their argument was, maybe with hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language, because nothing requires it.            And since, other things being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the same language you gave for the other side. And they said the judge rejected that argument, so now they tell us, well, that was wrong, he should have accepted it.    And all the rest of what he's saying is just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something like that.     But what about that one?          Well, I mean, should we answer the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a causation instruction.       The judge's causation instruction in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's causation instruction on contributory negligence, if there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the defendant's negligence.        And he says that isn't what happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one of them was this equivalence thing. So he's saying to us:               Decide it, say that they were wrong.    What's your view of that?          I'm not surprised. (Laughter.)          No, no.         That's just an argument.         It was not, but they say, nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was wrong.    One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of causation differently than when they spoke of causation in respect to the railroad.             We thought that was a reason why it was wrong then.         We think that's a reason why it is wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong for that reason.         Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon all that, that's just a series of different arguments that we'd like the Court to say.         If you read it carefully, you'll see it, basically. (Laughter.)
05-785 +++$+++              I thought the key sentence in this is he says the simple photograph of Tom Studer on a button which -- I don't know what the size is.                    Nobody has told them what the button is about.                    Nobody has put for the judge a picture of it.                 Nobody showed him what the button is.      So he says a simple photograph of Tom Studer was unlikely to have been taken as anything other than the normal grief occasioned by the loss of a family member.   Period.     Now, what else is there to say?                That's the court's conclusion. And it is pretty hard for me -- I looked for the button.   I couldn't even find the button in the record. I didn't even know what this looks like.                   It is a button, somebody later must have said two inches to four inches. I don't know who said that.                I don't know how the judge could have known that.          The button isn't in the record. So why isn't it just a normal sign of grief unlikely to influence anybody?       That's what they say.         In this case.         It goes on frequently in an opinion.    I have been known to do that myself.                   And I say this court over here says it's a da-da-da, and I say "sure isn't that."       Well, what is it?           Well, what was the -- what in your opinion -- this is why -- as you can see, I'm concerned about buttons.          I think they're probably a problem.     I think all judges are concerned about them. But then I think about this particular case.                   And I look at that single sentence:           "It was unlikely to be taken as a sign of anything other than normal grief." I mean, suppose this had been a different case. Suppose the defense in this case was the defendant Smith didn't pull the trigger.           It was an unknown person called Jones.     Then if I were on the jury, I would look out, see the buttons, and I'd say, hmmm, the family thinks it was Smith.     Otherwise they wouldn't be here with those buttons.     I could think that. But this isn't that case.               This is a case where everyone thinks your client pulled the trigger.                  The only question is whether the family's son came at him with a machete.     So when I look at the buttons, I'd think sure, they don't think the son came at him with -- I mean, they don't think that.       He's their son.              What would you expect them to think? So that's why I thought that they are saying that sentence, in this case.          In this case, it would be taken as sign of grief and nothing more.          This reason -- suppose, hypothetically, I would think -- well, the rule should be no buttons.     No buttons, no signs, no banners.         A courtroom is a place of fair trial, not a place for a demonstration of any kind.            Now, if I were to think that, and I also were to think it's just too difficult to figure out case by case whether there is or is not an improper influence, suppose I thought both of those things. Now, you've heard, quite rightly, the other side says:     One, you're supposed to decide whether this was clear in the law.      Two, if you're worried about the future, you can't lay down a rule that's clear in the law either because of A, AEDPA, and B, the case that was cited, which said it's holdings that count, not dicta. All right.      You write for me the words I'm supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.
05-83 +++$+++           Take Justice Alito's case, and nobody litigated it because nobody doubted that it was a loaded gun.        Now, what's the result?            All right.        So -- so, therefore, it's harmless.                 So, therefore, we use harmless error analysis.                 So what's the difference between that case and this case?            Yes, I quite -- I quite agree with you that there is the difference that in the Alito case as amended, it all happened before the jury got its verdict.             In our case, it happened after the jury reached a verdict.                Now, absolutely true. And my question, of course, is why does that matter.            No, no.       It was improperly instructed.              The judge forgot to give this instruction about the nature of the firearm.                     I take it -- at least my case -- the judge forgets to instruct about the firearm.         He just forgets.         All right?       And then the jury goes out.           It comes back and the lawyer says, Judge, I handed you the instruction.                      Why didn't you give it?         He says, oh, my God, I forgot.              Now, does harmless error apply to that case?          And I want to know why that matters because the only thing I've tried to create the hypothetical to matter is the one thing happens before the jury goes out, and the other happens after.                     And why does that matter?
05-848 +++$+++             It looks like -- I went back and read the Puerto Rico cement case.                And it certainly looks as if -- though the issue was somewhat different.   It looks as if the interpretation that the EPA is taking there is not consistent with what you are reading now and is consistent with what they're saying today.   And that was in 1988-89, I guess.               They must have been starting on that in '87.             So it seemed to me we have a mixed bag.   Some people were saying the one thing.                  Some people were saying the other thing.                And the later in time seems to be the Puerto Rico cement.                And that was at least 17 years ago.     And --              The analysis which was probably pretty much based on what they said, I think was that the reason there was increased potential here to pollute, was really because this change would permit the plant to be run more intensively or more hours, something like that.              No, we didn't address it. I'm not taking it as evidence of that.             I'm taking it as evidence that the EPA then had a basic position similar to what they have now. That's what I'm using it as a basis for thinking that they were not saying to have a change, the word "change" includes only a change in physical facilities that increases the amount of emission per hour.     Am I right?    Or --              So then they'll say your argument here, even if you are right, I think they think you're wrong -- but even if you're right, they'll say well, that's an argument that it is arbitrary, capricious abuse of discretion for them to change horses in the middle of the stream, i.e., for them to take an interpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without adequate notice and comment and so forth radically reverse that interpretation.             Now that's not the issue in front of us now.            Because?            They say because the Fourth Circuit didn't go really on that, it went on some statutory thing, and --          The obvious reason to do it is, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say, which is quite clean in the air.              And there is a power plant.     And what somebody works out, which is normal, is demand for electricity is increasing.              And so what we will do is we're going to take these turbines and system, and we're going to change it really radically. It doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 12 hours a day.     So there's going to be twice as much pollution in the air.      Now the whole idea of the PSD system is you don't have twice as much pollution in the air, and I guess that's why they wanted to do it.           Because you can use the same word, you can apply the same word in different places differently, depending on what your basic object is in the different place.         It's very hard to say what kind of modification might exist over here, there, the other place.    And you put your finger on a very difficult question for power companies, because those turbines do go at different amounts of rates and so forth during a day, during a month, during a year, so it's hard for them.     Therefore, you have a complex definition. What's wrong with that?             Why?    Because the language, I don't see anywhere in the statute where -- the words of modification are, it's a physical changing or change in a method of operation which increases the amount of any air pollutant.    Now those words, "physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant," could mean different things in different places.             Where does it say in the statute that they can't?           But you do have a brief here.   You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which is Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions Definition.           And throughout that brief it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even though you don't change the capacity of the machine. There's a whole brief on that.            So you already argued that whole brief, that what they were doing was inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.            No.    As being outside the statute at that time, and you did.            No.    I was just thinking, then you're left with what you called the weak argument, arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see how you make the stronger one, what you think is stronger, since you made it before, or a version of it before the D.C. Circuit.            No, not collateral estoppel, but you know, I'd be repeating myself.           That's what it is.
05-85 +++$+++               Well, what, what reason would Congress have for wanting a system that says -- and there are many, many, many people in the United States who would like to sue Pakistan.                   They would like to sue China.    They would like to sue Russia.                 There are all kinds of places they would like to sue.                   And why would Congress want to have a system that says to those countries, you can come into Federal court and get your claim adjudicated, whether it is really you, China a; but by the way, if the Federal judge makes a mistake, there you are in Mississippi, Alabama, Illinois, any one of 50 different states?         In front of juries, the very thing that we gave you this statute so you wouldn't have to do. Now what would their theory be?             They were saying they were an organ of --             Yeah, and therefore they are immune unless -- unless they fall within an exception.   And it may be they do. Is that not right?             Well, I'm saying, that's how the statute works.             But I take it if you win this, it's precisely the same, in respect to a person who has total immunity.             Why not?             Why not?             Yeah.             Yeah.       Yeah.             Yes.              And a Judge makes a big mistake --              China comes in --              And says of course you're China.    And then it signs a remand order.              No.     Well, after all -- if you're going to say, you say that one is reviewable on appeal.              Is it or not, in your view?              Fine.       And now all they want here is the organ issue reviewed on appeal.              And what's the difference between the one and the other?              Okay, and you agree with that?              Fine.       Then why is it in your opinion that the immunity thing is so important that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ thing is not so important since all, what turns on that is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.              We have this very old judge like me.    China is there.         And he says:         This isn't China; Formosa is China.          So he says remand.          So there we are, China is now in the Western District State Court for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money. Now, you said, I thought, before that where that happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they could, China, appeal in the Federal system.                  I thought you said that.              All right.              What?              All they want is a definitive appeal that this is really China, all right. Now, can they do that, yes or no?                 You said yes. So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was, if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly the same way on the question of whether they're an organ.    What's the difference?              I don't care.      I don't call this an appeal of a remand.            What this is, it is an Appeal of the determination precedent to remand that Powerex is not an organ.              That would make them just as happy, I believe.                Why not say, depending on the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be, why not just say Congress intended that you do get an underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but rather significant and important rights attach in the Federal court that do not attach in the State court. And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and the necessity to hire clever lawyers.
05-8794 +++$+++            But what he -- I -- I take it the ripeness issue is -- he delayed in bringing it because he wasn't certain what you'd do.                   And -- and one of the reasons, I think, would be that it's only recently there was an article in the Lancet --           -- that says the -- in the opinion of the doctors who wrote it, a significant number of executed people are conscious when they die, and that's painful. And then it's been suggested there are ways around that.             Just give them more sodium pentothal or have a doctor or somebody there to make certain the individual is unconscious at the time that the death- causing drugs take effect. All right.    Now, that doesn't seem too difficult.          Maybe it's difficult, but it doesn't seem too difficult.           So why can't they think, you know, Florida -- they can read there too.                      They have people who read these articles, and indeed, maybe they'll just do it.       They don't have any real interest in -- in causing suffering.          Why don't they just do it? And so he thinks, up until the last minute, that maybe Florida will just do it, and lo and behold, when the death warrant is actually executed, it now begins to appear that they won't.                  And therefore, at that time, he brings the case. Now, I've spun out a story which seems probable, but if it's true, it would be very understandable why this wasn't ripe before the execution warrant is issued and thereafter it is.                      Now, what is your reply on the ripeness question?        -- my -- my little story was inaccurate as to Florida or accurate as to Florida.        Is the kind of thing I was explaining why it would be ripe I think -- is that accurate enough for the purposes of ripeness as to what happened in Florida?        No.       But in respect to that core position, I can understand the State's concern with the possibility of abuse.          But in Nelson, what the Court says is it points to Gomez, and Gomez was a 1983 case. And there, the Court denied a stay of the execution because it looked into the history of the litigation, and they said that this particular individual had done just what worries you, though in a somewhat different context.         He kept bringing the cases, and every time, you know, he'd lose.         Then he'd think of another way of making the same point, and in your context, it would be first he challenges this method and he says there are others that are fine.          So we go to another.          Then he challenges that.         Then he challenges that.            Then he challenges that, always at the very last minute.                    So there's a case that provides a weapon if the abuse that you worry about occurs. So why do we need something else like an absolute rule of some sort that the Petitioner has to think of a method of execution, a matter on which he is not necessarily expert, that would turn out in the future to be not painful?             I mean, you don't need to put on your overcoat and also turn up the heat.         You've got the case that helps you if that occurs.             Why do you need to argue for something else?          Well -- well, why?      But I mean, suppose he doesn't.               Okay?      But it's absolutely clear he's not saying all methods are unconstitutional. He's saying this method is unconstitutional.               If he says this method of constitutional and he wins, then his challenge will not necessarily prevent the State from carrying out its execution.                And, of course, I'm reading to you directly from Nelson v. Campbell.                That would seem right in point.             And why isn't that the end of this case?       Yes, and if I bring a claim that my prison cell is so cold, I actually get pneumonia and die, or near it, and then I challenge the coldness of the cell, I'm preventing my confinement in one particular way.       It's a cold cell.      And so that would similarly, on your theory, be habeas, but we know it isn't.       My cold cell is habeas?            Why more than in Nelson?       So you're saying -- saying then that the defense bar, the capital punishment bar, and the prisoners are the group of people that have to go and do the research on humane methods of putting people to death rather than the government.       That strikes me as a little odd, doesn't it?   Why?       Old age.          They'll come with that alternative, old age.             Right? (Laughter.)
05-8820 +++$+++              That was the issue in that case.    This issue wasn't in that case.             I can't when I write something, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it happens to be a state case, refrain from using the word state.   I wouldn't say there is an implication in writing an opinion that it doesn't mean Federal as well. As least I can't find that written in the opinion anywhere.             Those are the most likely where people are going to get mixed up.                  I mean, I'm not following -- I think I think this argument about the word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both sides of this.    I just can't get a clear answer.               So if I were right about that and there is no clear answer from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns are practical.    If we take your position, we have words right next to each other, near each other in the same statutory provision, meaning different things.                  And I've learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up. And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have. The second concern of Justice Stevens, which is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who intuitively are going to cause the problem.                    Because on a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very good Supreme Court case.         And that's going to be the case where he forgets to file in the Federal court because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and behold, the Court grants it.            And now what happens?           On your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other interpretation, it seems to work out fine.                    So those, I would say are the two practical problems, and anything you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.              That's if you're formally right on the metaphysical question.                       But if you're not, now thinking you just gave a response to the Chief Justice that said, well, really the Federal district judge when he gets these things just has to look at them and then he figures out whether he is going to stay it or whether he's going to proceed on some issues or whether he is going to do something else. And that's what you thought was fairly easy. You have the experience there and I just wonder how easy it is.     I mean, why wouldn't it be easy?                   Because I guess before doing anything the judge has to know what this thing is about.        And that's where it seems to me to take the time of a district judge.                   They have many, many petitions.     Sometimes they are well organized, sometimes not.     He sends them to a magistrate possibly.                   The magistrate has a lot to do, and the time consumed is the time finding out what is this case about.                      Is that fair characterization or not?           How easy is it?
05-908 +++$+++               Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was is this basically a kind of last report? Or how close to a has resort is it?                     What's the history of this?   I thought the history involved a lawsuit to desegregate the schools, a much more rigid system of racial -- abuse of race.         Ultimately you come to this. Now you stop this.      And what happened after you stopped it?               Well, what is the history basically?     Am I right?               But that's not what I'm thinking.               I mean I'm thinking that, I thought as I read this, and you have to correct me because you have a better knowledge, originally the schools were highly segregated in fact.                   People brought a lawsuit.     Then to stop that Seattle engaged in a plan that really bused people around on the basis of race. That led to white flight.            That was bad for the schools. They then tried a voluntary choice plan.                 This is part of that plan.    Then when they abandon this plan, they discover more segregation.           Is that basically right or not?
05-9222 +++$+++            The fact is, we're looking at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the first petition that was filed; is that right?           So you look at it and it says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you said.     Then it says date of judgment of conviction, December 16, 1994.     So looking at that, you'd think that is what he was attacking.         Where does it say he's attacking anything else?           Yes, but I imagine there are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal system.    And I would think that judges when they're trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking, he has to figure that out often for statute of limitations purposes, or some other purpose.           He'd look over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked, unless of course there's some indication that it's something else. I've never heard of this before.           Is there any precedent on that where even though the petition refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest anything other than date A, because it turns out that there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're attacking date B. Is there any precedent that says that's how it's read?          No.    So this might be the first time.    I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it refers to.          I don't know what implication this is going to have for a lot of these petitions.    I don't know one way or the other, but it might be there are thousands right now in the Federal court which have date A, and somebody is going to go back and say no, it is really date B or something.                I'm a little nervous about it.       If you're not nervous, you're the ones in charge.          I don't want to take you up.   Let me just have one on the merits, one.          I mean, the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in my dissent.    I was trying as hard as I could to show why I thought this case was wrong.           I start the dissent by saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum, again quote, means "solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict."           Okay. Then at the end of the opinion I say: "Until now I would have thought the Court might have limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't cause so much harm."     Now, the next sentence of course I explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I guess I couldn't think of it. So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I didn't say how they might have limited Apprendi and I couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi, and they read Apprendi to mean what it said.            Now, you tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't think of that would have limited Apprendi?
05-9264 +++$+++            So in an ordinary city street in Miami walking along the street, there are a lot of houses, and there's a little bit of lawn or bushes in front, and there's not a fence, because there isn't, or there aren't fences in many city blocks, a person goes up to the house and starts to monkey around with the window to raise it or whatever, that's attempted burglary, not burglary, in Florida?           All right.     So then I doubt -- then again I'm left at sea.           I don't know how often that happens or is dangerous.           So if I think that this is really a statistical question, and I think maybe it is -- and the Government is in the best position, they have all the statistics, they have whole bureaus over there.   So what about a presumption against the Government? In a case where it seems to be a close case and it is a statistical question, and the Government doesn't have any statistics?            How are you supposed to decide it if there's a question as there is this instance I think?     I just don't know how dangerous attempted burglaries are.     I mean, maybe I'm not supposed to admit there are a lot of things I don't know but there are. And this is one of them.            I read the text several times.            Correct.    And here I think it might be less than burglary.            And extortion, though one thinks of somebody writing a poison pen letter or something and revealing a secret from the past -- many such crimes are threats of violence.               I mean, and that just read through the statutes, and that's what they are aiming at.    So I would say extortion is something that quite often could involve violence. But again that's cogitating.            So I get to attempted burglary.       I don't know.         Now what do I do?            What about attempted assault?    I bet nobody has ever been hurt in an attempted assault.            All right.    But it wouldn't fit within your -- I mean, I just wonder what happens when you try to get away from numbers.             Maybe there are a certain number of people injured during mail fraud or embezzlement, you know, some people get annoyed during an embezzlement and start hitting each other. I can't get away from the numbers.          So what's the test?        The test is either a high statistical number of injuries or if not, a nexus to a crime that does have a high statistical number of injuries?           I like the word nexus because whenever I see it in an opinion, I have no idea what it means. (Laughter.)
05-983 +++$+++                What is this to do -- I mean, I'm -- I'm puzzled about why we're talking about this complicated thing.          I mean why -- the statute as I read it has a section and it's called procedural, procedural rights.              And it says that the procedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both the children and the parents.              And it sets up some procedures in the agency which is for the children and the parents and school board, and everybody is supposed to be there.    And then another part of the same section says any person aggrieved by the first has a court hearing. Why isn't that the end of it?               It's clearly aimed, as the statute is aimed, at both students and parents.    And then we give them all procedural rights, and what in the statute says that the procedures that they're following before the school board happen to be for both parents and students.               But without saying a word, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure in the same section, without saying anything, would be just for the students and not for the parents? I mean, I find that hard to read the statute that way.              No, I'm not.     I'm talking about the whole Act.       Throughout the whole Act, they talk about parents and students.                And who writes the check? The student?                No.     Of course.   The parent writes the check.    And has the interest?               I have an interest in educating my children as you do in yours. And this statute talks about that throughout.                But you have --                You have to convince me that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every other section talks about, namely just children, not parents. Now why should I read that it way?             Your argument, I guess, is this argument.   Now you're conceding the parent does have a right to go to court, but he can only complain about something that hurts him.              Right?             He can't complain in court or -- well, it sounds as if you were saying that. You're saying that the hearing officer has to decide against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent. Isn't that your point?              Oh, well -- right.   I'm sorry.    Then you go ahead.         I thought I heard you say that the problem is that the parent didn't have a right taken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the parent can't go to court.              Oh, I would agree, we can be on the same grounds there.              I agree that if the parent isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to complain about, you know, whereas another section of the statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if the panther has something to complain about.             Isn't that so?   It says the -- I think so -- it says a parent is to be reimbursed.   I thought that was one of the things that --              So, now it looks as if the parent has something to complain about.                The parent hasn't got the money that he was supposed to get.                   Now we have something to complain about, so therefore, we're aggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved person can go to court.                 So I take it your argument is, your red brief argument is that Congress said, states, if you get some judgments against you and they award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't?                   Is that what it said?                 You don't pay for it, you can't pay for it out of the grant?                 Okay.       So we're not paying for this, you pay for it.            Is that right?                 States --                 -- if some people bring claims against you under this because you didn't have a good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant. Isn't that what you're saying it says?               I thought what your argument was -- and if it's not, forget it, it's just that I don't understand it.            That here the Government says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own action. And then later on they say, they define it differently.   They talk about prevailing party.                The parents of the prevailing party.               But you say that second phrase must mean the first phrase.                 Because it wouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for that out of the grant but not this out of the grant. That's your argument?               Okay.       It is an argument.
05-996 +++$+++              Is it true or not what I said, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you had a dishonest debtor, the present -- the proceeding is dismissed on 7.    He gets the papers back.               The papers permit him access to a hidden source of resources, and he steals them basically.         Is that possible or is that fanciful?
05-998 +++$+++           Suppose -- suppose we found out.   Somebody told what happened, and it was a crime of bank robbery or it's an assault of a mailman, a postman. And you know, it turns out they didn't present one word of evidence, not a word that says that this individual who was assaulted had anything to do with the mail. There's complete absence of any evidence whatsoever on a major element of the offense.            And now, suppose we get finished with the trial.       Plenty of evidence. Conviction.    Can you go back and raise that?          No.     No.   I mean can you win.          Yeah.          I mean, you see, I'm saying is that error?    Is that correctible error?           I'm saying there is an absolute error.          It is far worse than here. We know for a certainty there was no evidence whatsoever presented to the grand jury on a major element of the crime.          Yes, I assume we know that. Take that as a given.       We know.          Yeah, we know.           Yes.    Zero.           Yes, but what is the answer to my question, yes or no?      I'm saying after the --           That's right.   So the answer is no?           And if you can't raise that, which is a major area because there's a harmless error is what it really amounts to, why isn't the same true here where the error is far more likely to be simply technical and make no difference given the adequacy of the evidence?           It does as well in my case.              Can't you ask for a bill of particulars?              Well, then you would have had no problem.             That's a separate requirement.     I don't know if it's constitutional or not constitutional, but I didn't think that requirement was at issue here. The requirement of stating the facts is not the requirement of setting out the elements of the law. At least that's my understanding.             Now, you can correct me if I'm wrong.             No, I'm not denying that. I just didn't think that had anything to do with this case.   I mean, I thought that the object of the indictment initially was to set forth what crime the person was accused of and inform him of that. You are saying, and then there is another requirement, which seems a little vague.             It's been hard for me to find out, to pin this down, and it's the one you state, which is that it says in addition in the rule you have to have facts. I don't know if those are the same.            I thought they were two separate things.          That's exactly what I -- I tried to read some treatises on this, and the more I read, the more confused I got. I started out thinking, well, it's sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October 14, 2004, in the city of such and such, at the corner of such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by force or threat of force, take property belonging to someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be sufficient.    And that you don't have to say, and in addition he, you know, what the force consisted of, did it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist.          Can you give me some enlightenment, at least if you think that's relevant here?          If it's excessive detail, the central fact, then why isn't on such and such a date at such and such a time he attempted to?            All right.           Then why, if that's so, why wouldn't that apply as well if they said he attempted to and committed an overt act in -- that is a substantial step.     And then you're saying in addition, they have to list the particular facts.            I couldn't find any case in this Court that said that.         I mean, I found in Hamling a case that went the other way, a general statement.                    They said all you have to do is say obscenity, you don't have to say how obscene or in what way it's obscene, et cetera.            Yeah.        Yeah.    Yeah.   And then Russell seems lost from sight for quite a while, or isn't followed a lot.           Suppose that it's an assault and the indictment says on such and such a day, at such and such a time, he assaulted the postman, right?     You also have to say what, that he waved his fist or that he had a knife?              You have to say that in the indictment?           No.    All right.   So I thought normally essential facts means simply the facts -- you can state the essential facts by writing the statute and normally that tells you.             Now, is that true?    One case that seems to go the other way is Russell.           Normally, yes.           Why more than any other word in the statute?      "Attempt," people know what that means.            And they also know what "assault" means.   And if you tried, you could spell out "assault."   They know what "robbery" means, but you could spell it out. So why does the Ninth Circuit think this one you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't have to?
06-1005 +++$+++                  The question is can you violate the statute by financial transactions which -- have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are no more than part of the crime itself? That's basically the question.                 And I think Justice Kennedy is asking if, in fact, we wanted to reach that question, is this a case in which we could do it, through reargument or in some other way?                And was it raised in the court below?
06-10119 +++$+++                 Can I go back to Ms. Scott?                Could I go back to Ms. Scott?                Yes.      If you look at the top of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I think, is that the prosecutor is posing a general question.   And then he poses his question -- or she -- and goes around and gets an answer.                       Here is Mr. Lindey. So they start out with the death penalty.                       They have some ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366.                       Then the prosecutor says, "Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said you could not impose the death penalty."                       "Mrs. Goff -- Ms. Goff:     I could consider the death penalty."                    "Ms. DuPont:     I couldn't hear."          Prosecutor:            You could consider both?"      "Yes, I would consider it."                   "Ms. DuBois:     I could consider it.             Yes."         "Ms. Archonie:    I could consider it."        "Mrs. Alvino:              I could consider it."   "Ms. Scott:     I could.           I could." Now, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me -- to me.    It seems that what they're talking about, each of them, is the death penalty because that's what, by the time they got to the top of 367, they were talking about.    Maybe there's ambiguity there.               But I haven't noticed in anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you just made.               No -- well, there's -- I just read you what it was, so I guess people make up their own mind about that.           But by -- what I don't think you can make up your own mind as ambiguous is when this prosecutor met with an answer that he considered not -- call it strictly kosher, when he found that, like Mrs. Calligan, she said, "I'm not sure."                      That's more ambiguous than Mrs. Scott.           And then he goes on, for three pages of additional questioning, and then 26 pages later, he doesn't excuse her yet and he doesn't excuse her until she volunteers, "I could give a verdict -- I don't think I could give a verdict to take someone's life." And it's at that point that the prosecutor excuses her. Now, compare that to Ms. Scott, who started out saying "I think I could" and then, as I read it, said "I could."    Now, that's the kind of comparison here.    No follow-up.     At the worst, minor ambiguity.              And a slight hesitation. Now, what do you say to that?               And that, of course, is a problem I have generally in this area.                    We can always imagine that things that are not in the transcript, perhaps what she said spokenly not in the transcript is "I hate the death penalty.            I'll never -- I'll never apply it under any circumstances."                   And I grant you, if that's the law, we are never going to find that there's any prejudice.    But I just don't see how that could be the law.               Well, of course -- sorry.                Exactly.         He's entitled to a fair trial without prejudice.                What it says is the clerk called the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't worry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told.                     He's challenged for that reason.              He might still worry about it.   But Mr. Laws is not.           And Mr. Laws is a self-employed contractor who announced to the court, I have a big problem this weekend; two houses are near completion, the owners are supposed to be moving in; my wife has just had a hysterectomy, she's supposed to be taking care of the children back home, and I -- she has nobody to help. Okay?     He's not challenged. So we're not worried about Mr. Laws worried about his wife and his business which going down -- you know, serious.    But we are worried about Mr. Brooks, who has been told by the dean you have no problem.                   Now, that's a little bit of a problem to me.                If you add them up, we have Ms. Scott we have Mr. Brooks, we have the mention of -- and three others -- three others, the only other three black people are challenged off, and we have the -- no black juror us on and we have the references to O. J. Simpson beside. Okay?     All right so, there you are.                 Full case against you.             No, she means the dean. The dean --             -- said no problem at all. What better arrangement can you want?               I don't know the answer to this at all but how this is supposed to work?                      A defense attorneys -- the jury selection, and he sees that the prosecutor doesn't challenge for peremptory or any other reason one black member.          Let's call it five. And then they start challenging black members.   Obviously, he didn't at the beginning impose any Batson claim.     He had no Batson claim.               There were five people on the jury who were black.                  What claim could you make? And then after you begin to get suspicious and start to make them, now they do this thing called black strike and they get everybody off the jury. How is it supposed to work?               They don't know.               I'm speaking reality.                 That was my question.              Can I ask you one other question.     You are the only one who will know the answer to, this too.     I noticed in looking at the opinion of the Louisiana Supreme Court that they start out by saying we have conducted another review of the voir dire transcript and find nothing there to disparage the Batson claim.     In reading that opinion in several places they refer to their having gone back and having read the whole transcript themselves. And then they have two full pages, or one and a half anyway where they seem to be talking about what happened in a pretrial conference and they refer to that prior review and covered a factor favorable to the State's use of a peremptory challenge. They went back and found a factor of favorable to.    Now, was that factor argued to them in the brief?    Do you remember that?              I thought that's why you might know. (Laughter.)              I thought that, in reading it, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking about how a judge can't think of everything.                   But if they're going to think beyond what the briefs tell them, they ought to think of it for both sides, and not just for one side.

06-1037 +++$+++               Let me ask you this sort of basic question:    Does it use age any differently than it uses years of service?             What is wrong with using that as a benchmark?      If you can fire a person when he is 55, why can't you use it as a benchmark as to how much you're going to give a disability person on pension?             The lesser or greater -- this would be an instance where greater includes lesser for the reason that this lesser business has no stereotypes.   All they're trying to do is to help people who are disabled at a time when they are younger and probably have fairly good expenses, and everybody gets this kind of insurance. And this man who is the Plaintiff here had it, too, while he was there.            So it's true you are really using in a minimal sense age, but you are doing it in a statute that permits you to do it because it's a lesser version of that.              It doesn't say it's inapplicable.   I wasn't saying it's inapplicable.             What I am worried about -- and this is a perfect example of people using absolutely mechanical rules, and particularly when you talk about pension systems, which, of course, age is relevant to a pension system, and what they do is find comparisons; and, before you know it, you are in the kind of a -- of a hamburger situation where it's so chopped up that perfectly worthwhile things are forbidden.      And this would seem to be a number 1 exhibit.              No, because what you are looking at is to see whether the purpose of Congress is somehow implicated, a purpose designed to prevent stereotypical thinking from being used to put older people at a disadvantage.           And there is no indication that this is so in this case.              Now, what's the response?               What about this idea, which is -- would this wreck the statute?                     You say we're talking about age, which is not an immutable characteristic.   Everybody goes through it.                    Everybody is younger, everybody is older.              And therefore we take the word "discriminate" and the word "discriminate" in this context, when considered in terms of pension requirements, which inevitably are age mixed to a considerable degree, means that if there are plausible justifications and no significant reason for thinking that it reflects stereotypical thinking, that it does not fall within the scope of the word "discriminate."               I started out by saying, that's why I said that this is not an immutable characteristic, and it is -- that's why I put all the qualifications in there.              Would it be the same as -- I mean it seems to me now -- I'm thinking the problem is we are going into the package; we are starting opening up the package that the 55-year-old retiree normally gets. Suppose they said this:                     here's what we'll do to the disabled person.           We'll treat him just as if he retired at 55.    He is only 35; and, moreover, at 55 when you retire in our police force, we give you a big party and a gold watch.         Well, we don't do that if you retire later on.    Same kind of claim. Why not?     Over 65 years old, he retired. Hey, you didn't give him the gold watch.                    Why did you give the other person the gold watch?                    You said the reason is we treat them all like we treat them when you retire at 55.             That's fair, that you don't understand. (Laughter.)
06-1082 +++$+++               The particular illegal arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit, is I take it they arrested him because he had a suspended -- he was driving without a good license?              Okay.       So that Virginia law says if you stop somebody, arrest him -- if you stop somebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive, you can arrest him if you think he's going to continue driving?   Can't you?              Okay.       So the policemen here, according to you and I guess the Virginia court, made a misjudgment.     He thought this guy might still drive somewhere or he might have thought it or a policeman in similar circumstances might have thought it. So Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you stop somebody for suspended -- for driving without a license, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we don't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's going to continue to drive.            We don't even suspend.          We don't even suspend.     We don't even suppress the evidence.   That's Virginia. So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make, for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a person who's driving without a license will keep driving once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?             What is the difference between this and Whren?         That is, in Whren the arrest violated a D.C. regulation that says a plainclothes officer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases of immediate danger.       And in Whren we said that isn't such a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment turns on that kind of triviality. All right.      If it doesn't turn on that kind of arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized it there, how is this any any different?              Can we go back for a second?    Because, the reason I asked my question is I was thinking about this very differently, and I just want to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on this.     My thought is that the answer to the question of whether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State -- when a person is arrested in violation of State law, the answer is:     it depends.       Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law, herein -- there embodied in a rule, the answer is no. So I look at this one.         And this one it seems to me there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is a crime for which the State permits arrest where the officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving. So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what we had in Whren. Now I want you to say -- I want your comments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement, because I want to get your reaction to that point of view.   I'm not saying I hold it.              But I'm putting it forward so that I can get your reaction and argument.             Putting cases aside for the moment --             I mean if we reach this question, you must have lost on the first question.                 I mean you win -- if you win on the first question, you win. If you -- all right.              If you have lost on the first question, this is not an unreasonable search -- arrest, rather, under the Fourth Amendment. And, moreover, it's not enough of a big deal, so the State makes it suppressible.                Otherwise, a -- and so now we're talking about minor things under State law that is secondary at the least. And there, when the policeman make a mistake about that, the reason we let him search is he might be hurt, the policeman.     There's danger involved. And so I don't see why at the moment that rationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason for it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is a violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he, you know, thought the guy was going to keep driving under the suspended license or, you know, might be risky or might not show up.
06-11206 +++$+++              What one are we to do with -- Justice Stevens -- I think you should address the statistics in the sentencing report.             As I read them, they put together -- if you put together failing to report and failing to return, you get 160 cases in their sample. And the number of those cases, whether you looked at the time when he had left or whether you looked at the time he was apprehended, in which force was involved is zero. The number of cases in which injury was involved is zero.   The number of cases where he had a dangerous weapon is five.             All right.       So now there we are.              You had every opportunity, when we have 160 cases out of the universe -- I guess I don't know what the universe is, but sampling proceeds through a small amount of cases.                 And you could, of course, criticize the Sentencing Commission effort if you have the statistician or someone who will tell us that that sampling was not an appropriate method to proceed.     Is there any such person?               No.     Why -- that was my question.   Why take into account the sample size in the absence of a statistician who would tell us that the sample size is too small to reach the conclusion that the commission reaches?
06-11429 +++$+++ 
06-11543 +++$+++                So there is no State where speeding -- even if maybe you hurt somebody or something -- there is no State where speeding is under a statute that you could be imprisoned for more than a year?               Well, a felony as defined here.   I just wanted to be sure you're focusing -- it's defined here as "subject to by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."       Now is --               Okay, I just want to be sure we're on the same wavelength.                  Fine.                Then they could have turned it just on dangerousness.           I'm back to Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of repeating those in a sense that make it quite specific. Imagine a universe of crimes.              Every member of that universe we concede has precisely the same degree of danger as arson, explosives, burglary.                   So there's no argument about the risk to human life.                   It is identical. And now we write a statute, and the statute's object is to take people who are felons in possession of a gun and those persons whom it is particularly bad that they have a gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum.                   So what we're looking are people who are particularly bad that they have a gun.       Now go back to our universe, and in that universe we have some things on the one hand like arson, but on the other hand -- I have to name a few, environmental crimes committed by negligence or recklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance down the drain or -- here's a good one I found -- if you are a steamboat captain or an executive of a steamboat company and you fail through negligence or simple inadvertence to stop somebody from not inspecting a lifeboat, well, felony or worse.              And there are quite a few dozens of these things:           Failing to stop at an inspection station if you are a trucker.               You know? There are quite a few, where what's at issue is negligence, thoughtlessness, and maybe even recklessness, but it seems to have nothing -- and it's dangerous -- but has nothing to do with whether, when later on you want a gun, you are a greater risk for having a gun, you're more likely to pull the trigger, you're more likely to aim it at somebody and shoot him. Now, that's I think what we are trying to drive at.              Is a person who deliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he had a gun might pull the trigger?                  And I will suggest that's a reasonable inference.                I also will give you this:   That a person who's so careless as to go drunk driving is a person whose gun might go off carelessly or he might leave it around the house.                       So I'll give you that one.     But my instinct is that Congress, in this Act, is not worried about guns going off carelessly around the house.     They are worried about a person being the kind of person who will point a gun at somebody and pull the trigger.     Now, is there something you can say that disabuses me of that instinct?
06-116 +++$+++                 Now their reason for doing that must be that those people who they've exempted entirely by statute are not going to be much help in paying Guam.     Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the same thing true of the two-thirds of the property that they don't take into account when they set their taxes?              Because?              No.     It doesn't secure it one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take it into account when you set your taxes.               Just as is true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind. Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its statute, but so could it change its statute in respect to a school, a university, or whatever the other things are that are off those tax rolls.               You know that, you know, your answer was circular.             That assumes that the whole property is, but it isn't.               Which one?       You say they've all used market values?               Well, which of the ones that use it have in fact an assessed value that is a percentage of market value?              All right.       Well, that doesn't help us then.              Well, we could look at Hawaii.    In Hawaii they use the word assessed value. They couldn't possibly have wanted it to be market value, I wouldn't think.              And in the District of Columbia -- where are we on this?                 It's something else in D.C.    They use assessed value in the Virgin Islands.
06-11612 +++$+++  
06-1164 +++$+++                  No, that isn't -- I don't think it's quite -- putting the argument as I understand it, you would say let's look at Irwin, and we read it, so it's in your mind.        Now think of that set of statute of limitations, the Federal ones, the Government ones, that are either just as ambiguous as Irwin or even more ambiguous.   Think of that set. Now, in Irwin the Court says in the absence of special circumstances that whole set is going to be interpreted as nonjurisdictional.                That's what it says. So you say, well, what Irwin didn't talk about is suppose there's a member of that set where previously the Court had held it was jurisdictional.                It doesn't tell us what to do.     Shall we read it as an exception or shall we not? And so what they are saying is, don't read it as an exception.     There's no need to do so.            Congress probably never really thought about any of this stuff. Read it, Irwin, as including that one, too. So what do you think of that point, whether it's theirs or not, leaving aside the argument about whether this particular statute does or does not fall within that set?   Assume it does.             Absolutely right, and then the question is does the simple fact that we previously held to the contrary count as a rebuttal?               Does Irwin mean to -- see that's the same question I had before, so what do you think about that?             Because?
06-1181 +++$+++               I'm having a lot of trouble understanding the case, because it's so complicated.                 If you -- could you track it through for a minute?                 I mean, as I understand this, this probably doesn't concern people who want to voluntarily depart before their case is finished, right?     Where they don't reopen because there is nothing to reopen?              Okay.       So we're at a person who is before the Board or before the hearing examiner and he wants to -- he is now got a final order against him.             Okay.       So now you say to him I'll tell you what we'll do to you:                  You leave, go, good-bye, and we'll let you pursue your appeals anyway, but from out of the country.             That's true?       Just tell me if I'm getting it right.             I'm not talking about reopening.    I'm talking about appeals.             And can you go to court, too?             Okay.       So no problem.   You say go, good-bye, and we'll give you some good deals here if you'll really go, but you pursue your appeals.             That's what I'm asking, I'm getting at.              I'm not talking about motions to reopen at all.              Okay.       But you can go to there?     You go to the BIA?              Okay.       Now, why wouldn't you treat --              Cannot.          Okay.   But you can go to the BIA?     Leaving the country?              You can't go anywhere.                 So you lose all your appeals, not just your motion-to-reopen appeals if you leave the country?                 Oh.     Okay.       So you say --              So your basic is -- don't tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please.                  The -- the -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position is and why you've got into this, is because you think any really meritorious case where there should be reopening will be pointed out to the Board before there is a final order in effect and before voluntary departure becomes an issue?             And if we decide against you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in every case is after there is a final order, the alien will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a few extra days.             He gets a -- several --             Have I got it right, what your point is?              Well, if they don't provide for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it arbitrary not to let him do it?               I mean -- what -- if it's -- if it's arbitrary --              It sounds almost arbitrary to say to a person, look, if you think you have some new evidence and want to reopen, do it.                      But Congress wanted you to get out of here in respect to this 60 days, so you have to give up that.            You're not getting those benefits.     Now, it's a tough bargain, but it seems reasonable.              What I don't see is to say once you ask for this you can never get status adjustment.              So why not apply them to this person?             So what about this?    I'm just trying this out.       You don't have to respond if you don't want to.    But you say, look, the AG in his rules here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that we talked about in our prior conversation.               Now hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable way of going about this, and we remand for consideration about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive discretion?
06-1195 +++$+++                They get additional process.   The question, I guess, is whether it is an adequate substitute for having withdrawn the writ of habeas corpus. On that question, suppose that you are from Bosnia, and you are held for six years in Guantanamo, and the charge is that you helped Al-Qaeda, and you had your hearing before the CSRT. And now you go to the D.C. Circuit, and here is what you say:     The CSRT is all wrong.                   Their procedures are terrible.           But just for purposes of argument, I concede those procedures are wonderful, and I also conclude it reached a perfectly good result. Okay?    So you concede it for argument's sake.   But what you want to say is:                      Judge, I don't care how good those procedures are.                I'm from Bosnia.        I've been here six years.        The Constitution of the United States does not give anyone the right to hold me six years in Guantanamo without either charging me or releasing me, in the absence of some special procedure in Congress for preventive detention. That's the argument I want to make.               I don't see anything in this CSRT provision that permits me to make that argument.     So I'm asking you:             Where can you make that argument?             Exactly.             If he cannot make that argument, how does this become an equivalent to habeas, since that happens to be the argument that a large number of these 305 people would like to make?              I thought we were here talking about -- I see that you have a strong argument and they'll have a strong argument in reply.            I think both are pretty good, how you interpret these cases.                 I thought we were talking about what the availability of a forum in which you can make your argument and they can make their argument, and that's why I'm back to the question of this is remedy that's given in the statute sufficient to allow you to make your argument and their to make their argument?         And what you said was, when I thought I produced an example of an instance they wanted to argue quite strongly, and you said no, they couldn't. Then you said well, neither could they in England.    Well, that I wonder.             That's where I'm back to.   After all, England doesn't have a written constitution.   So it is hardly surprising if they concede everything away in England, they're not going to be able to make any argument.              There's nothing left. But let's image in England you had a statute and that statute said the government cannot hold an alien in Beckawannaland for six years without either charging them or releasing them.         Or except for -- and we have some very detailed preventive detention.                 Suppose there was a statute like that.          And then our friends in England in whatever year conceded every argument but that one. Now, are you going to tell me now that the habeas courts would have said we won't even listen to your argument?              Correct.         And you told me in this statute the court of appeals will not listen to that argument.   And as I read the statute, I agree with you.   Because I can find no place where they could make that argument since it does not concern how well this tribunal did, nor does it concern the constitutionality of the procedures of the tribunal.               It wasn't cleverly redrafted.   I wanted to say that the people I'm thinking of are not challenging those procedures.                  What they say is you could have the best procedure in the world, and they're totally constitutional -- we'll assume that -- they're assuming it.        They're not going to concede it. They're assuming it. On that assumption, we still think that Congress, the President, the Supreme Court under the law, cannot hold us for six years without either trying us, releasing us, or maybe confining us under some special statute involving preventive detention and danger which has not yet been enacted.               They are arguing it.             Well, on that -- and you just mentioned remedy.      Suppose, contrary to what you hope for, that the Court were to say that this is -- we have a minute or two. Suppose they were to say that this is an unconstitutional suspension of the writ, and that the remedy here written in the statute is not adequate in respect to many claims that might be made. On that assumption, the habeas would lie. Now, it has been six years, and habeas is supposed to be speedy. And, yet, people have serious arguments, anyway, that they are being held for six years without even having those arguments heard. Is there anything in your opinion that this Court could say by way of remedy that could get the D.C. Circuit or the others to decide this and the CSRT claims, there are 305 people to do this quickly within a period of months rather than six more years?            And if so, what?             Are we faced with this problem, and I don't want to put you right on the spot, what approximately would you say in respect to this? Because it is a serious problem.
06-1204 +++$+++                 I thought the issue in the Philippines is the question of whether the money that went into the stock certificates eventually belonged to the people of the Philippines from the beginning or belonged to Marcos personally?              And you're saying that there's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine court could say that this money initially belonged to the people of the Philippines?              I'm saying whether they -- I don't care what the name of the proceeding is.                I'm saying could they decide that?              All right.       Now, if they decide that, why should your clients, terribly treated as they were, get the money ahead of the victims in the Philippines, who also were terribly treated?              I thought Justice Souter just answered that.     He said that the stock certificates might be held to belong to the people of the Philippines, in which case the stock certificates represent stock in a company that has a claim against Merrill Lynch, and so they will say, this certificate belongs to the people of the Philippines; the people of the Philippines would like you, Merrill Lynch, to pay back the money that the company gave them initially. And Merrill Lynch I imagine would pay it.                  Now that I think is as I understand it.             Is there something wrong with my understanding?               I didn't see that finding in the court of appeals decision.                 I thought the court of appeals thought that they belonged -- they couldn't possibly belong to the Philippine Government or the people there, because there is no way that the Philippine Government could win in a suit in New York in trying to recover them.         But the Solicitor General has provided about two or three ways, in which and so -- and so have the Petitioners -- and that seems to me the heart of the issue.      They have said:                 No, no, there are two or three ways in which the Philippine Government might well -- it might well ask a court for the money and the court would say, yes, you're entitled to it. So that it seems to me, that's the heart of it.   What is your response to that?              Yes, well, that isn't what they say.   I think, if I understand it, that they say that were the share certificates in the hands of the Philippine Government on the ground, that the money used to create those had been taken from the Philippine people unlawfully, if that's what they decide, at that point the owner of the certificates, the government, would say to Merrill Lynch:             We own the company, the company has the assets; please send us the money.                  And Merrill Lynch would do it. But if Merrill Lynch didn't do it, then they would file the judgment saying, these are our share certificates, in the New York court and say, will you please enforce the judgment.             Now, there is something there that I'm not quite getting and that's why I want you to respond to the line of happenings that I just suggested.               There is a huge change. The change would be that they'd a judgment of that special court over there that this company and the assets understandably belong to us, not to the Marcoses. And so this time, they go with that judgment to Merrill Lynch and say:    Give us the money. And if they -- if they don't -- if Merrill Lynch says no -- Merrill Lynch might say yes, but you'll say, no, it belongs to us, so they might not.                And if they don't, then the Philippines are never going to get the money, unless they bring the lawsuit.                And once they bring the lawsuit, then you have them, because then you go right into the court in that lawsuit and intervene and they have waived all their sovereign immunity, et cetera, they can't get the money.               With a difference.                 Do you have -- I mean I don't see you have a claim there as opposed to the -- the worst that would happen, not necessarily good for your clients, but the worst that would happen would be that the assets would be devoted to victims and their families in the Philippines.              I mean, namely to the Philippine people.      So I don't see some kind of fundamental unfairness here, unless you can point one out.                 I mean they'll treat you like another creditor and you have -- but is there some terrible unfairness going on?              Is there -- is there something special going on, specially unfair, in respect to the delays where you are treated differently than other litigants in the Philippines?
06-1221 +++$+++               All right.       So what should we do then?     Sorry.     Go ahead and conclude.            But I want to ask this after you finish answering Justice Souter.              And finish your answer to Justice Souter.             Well, that's exactly what's sort of bothering me.      You are the trial lawyer.             And I'm not.           And what's worrying me most about this is I will say something that will muck up quite a lot of trials.                     So, therefore, the sentence that jumps out the page here was where the court of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an extraordinary remedy that should be sparingly -- used sparingly. Is that a general rule? Because my impression was -- and this is why I asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401 and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that last a thousand years. And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the trial under control is to say:              Well, maybe there is some slight tendency here to make a fact more likely than not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of time. And I thought that kind of decision is what trial judges are there to make.               And, therefore, I thought this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that trial court judge unless that trial court judge is making an absolute rule, which he may have been. But as soon as we get into this case, I thought we might do quite a lot of harm by trying to let the court of appeals second-guess trial courts on this kind of thing. Now, I would appreciate your response to that.               Well, then, how are we going to -- I'm not arguing about what it says so much as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court of appeals and the trial court to decide?              And all I'm worried about -- and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth Circuit or elsewhere.      I was an appeals court judge for a quite a while.   And I think we have never -- not "never," but hardly ever second-guessed a trial judge on that kind of question.              Now, you tell me if the rules are different in the Tenth Circuit?                    Do they out there second-guess trial judges on this kind of question all the time?              All right.          If they don't normally, why should they here?              If this kind of rule is -- as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other evidence, any other evidence at all.                    It may be relevant, or it may not be.            It depends on the case.             A waste of time or not depends on the case.              I got your blanket part.            I got that.              Oh, no, not -- I'm saying -- well, you got my point, but you're just not answering my question.              And I don't want to repeat it.    And I'm not talking about whether it is hearsay or not.   I'm not talking -- I'm talking about whether it comes in 401, 402, 403.         That's the issue.
06-1249 +++$+++               The --the part I'm trying to figure out is this:         Suppose it was before trial.                   I don't care, before or after.              The plaintiff comes in with a claim.     All right.         Manufacturer:             That's pre-empted.     The claim is that you should have told the FDA and added something to your label. Manufacturer:     That's preempted.              Plaintiff:        Well, you haven't read this reg here.              The reg here which has been in existence since 1965 says that we can go and add something.     I mean you can go and add something to show a contra indication, and that's the end of it. Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess, without the horrible things happening that Justice Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know. But 30 years later the FDA makes another mention of new information.    I take it that's in 1982.                     That's the first time that happened. Now, if I'm right about that, what happens when no one says a word about that?                       Of course, if the manufacturer had said something about that, then maybe the plaintiff would have said:                And it was new.           It was new, but the manufacturer doesn't say a word.                       Are you following what I'm saying?             I mean, I'm wondering still what happens.    I believe what happened here is that in the argument in the lower courts, in the trial court, nobody said anything about the FDA's claim that the information necessary to just go ahead and change the label had to be new.       Am I right about that?             So what I'm trying to figure out -- and I don't know if "burden of proof" is the right word -- where nobody says a word about it, who wins?   If they had said a word about it, you need new information, maybe the manufacturer -- the plaintiff could have shown that the manufacturer had new information.
06-1286 +++$+++              A glass --               Before -- I mean, we have lots of good examples.         I mean, I could have colored my room at home, painted it with light green plastic, but I wouldn't have done it.         I mean, endless examples.                Well, what would -- that's why I made the suggestion I had earlier.                  I was doubtful about the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a purely factual one.       And so suppose you said, which would come to about the same thing, that expenditure would be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't hold these assets in trust.              What that means is would a -- an investor not in the trust, not holding it in trust, reasonably have been, or a reasonable investor have been likely to make this expenditure?                 That turns it into a more quasi-legal question where people -- and then it's a matter of judgment, which these things do come down to.   That's what judges are there for, to judge.     And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof problem.     It comes to about the same thing.                Is there any objection to it?        What's the reason not to do it?              But are you --              You would be, of course, exactly right, that there could be trusts, very big trusts.    Children get into fights trying to split up the assets.    Millions is paid on lawyers and investment advisors to see if each share, figured 14 different ways, is going to earn this money or that money.                   And that kind of thing exists.            And there the investment advisors are likely to be special.                   So you can't say investment advice is always special or never special. Now, again, this seems to me not unknown, this kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and therefore there tend to be methods of allowing exceptions, of putting burdens.                I mean, is this case somehow -- am I wrong about that?                I'm looking really for a form of words to write that does not use the word "could" but which gets at what I think the statute was after, which is:    Let them have this no floor for their special stuff but not for ordinary stuff that others would have incurred regardless.                I want to know what form of words.   I find it difficult to go beyond the statute, frankly.                Yes.                That's right.     That's right. (Laughter.)                If I reject this word "could" and "uniqueness," now what form of word should I write?                 If had you to choose between that and getting the idea of the reasonable taxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you choose?
06-1287 +++$+++               All right.         So they don't know, and they use all these different methods sort of as checks one on the other.              Now, the railroad simply wants to say:    Look, you had an expert here and he went and used a method, and it comes up with a certain number, but if you look at a few other methods, you'll see that's an outlier.         Okay?        Now, why shouldn't it be able to do that?              They're not going to do that.   The State has enormous leeway.                    Anyone who valued a railroad running through the center of this city, of what it would be worth if the property were sold on the private market, you'd get an astronomical number.            So the chances of this number being higher than the sales value of private property is not great. So, if you've come in with some method that puts it higher than that, well, why shouldn't they be able to come in and say:         Look, look what they've got with this method, which in our opinion is not a fair method.   Now, why not?      Because after all, if you're going to say they can't, then there is no check on the State working out a method that discriminates, as Justice Ginsburg said, seriously against the railroads.              What they're going to do is they're simply going to let people present the evidence as you've heard, which will have 15 valuation methods if they want, all serving each as checks on the other. There's no single method.          So why would you end up with that result?
06-1321 +++$+++              Am I right now in thinking, just as a matter of practice, where there is retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race discrimination, Federal Government, that the person making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court? That's right?             The same thing in respect to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go through the civil service system or the collective bargaining agreement; is that right?             No, not what they do if their claim is a retaliation claim.             Yes.             Yes.      And now, do you have -- two things:   A, do you have any evidence one way or the other that one of these two systems -- the civil service plus collective bargaining, on the other hand; or EEOC plus the court, on the other -- works better, works the same, works worse?             No.     So we don't know.              Yes.      Now what reason -- okay.   So we don't know.              But that's drawing something from where you don't know.                     Okay.   So that's fair enough. But is there any -- what is the best reason, in your opinion, that Congress would have wanted to make this distinction?    What are the best two or three reasons?    If you were just starting with a blank slate, why would Congress have wanted to send the one to the one route and the other to the other route.              For the people who complained about race.                But I'm asking you, and if you were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought -- the conclusion that I would reach from what you're saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat them differently.
06-1322 +++$+++               Suppose they made a mistake here.              What I think Miss Lensing, one of her more basic points is this:                   There is a statute.   And the statute says the EEOC shall send prompt notice in part to the conciliation.                   And she adds, if we get the notice, we also start getting evidence and preserving it and talking to people.                      There are a lot of things they would like to do with that notice.              Now, I replied to that, well, okay, they complain about the lack of notice.                     But her response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice when they file a charge.         That's just a mistake.              But if you start calling these documents charges, well, they never give notice, so they will never do it.                   It will be a big problem, so, therefore, don't call them charges. Now, I want to know what your answer is to the first part of what I said.                My -- I was assuming that if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute and a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to give notice and if they are hurt by that, they can complain about it.              But they must make mistakes in their history when they file charges and didn't give notice.    So what does the law tell us?                  If you found it any case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now the complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the complainant's fault, her response is work out some kind of equitable tolling.        But there must be law on this, because this couldn't -- this is a big agency and they must have sometimes in the past forgotten to give notice.              What does the law say happens when they don't give notice?              Well, it wouldn't be a defense.    I mean, it's not this complainant's fault. It's the --             You'd have to work out some kind of equitable tolling or something.                    I think she's right about that.    There is no law to your knowledge or what is there?              And the practical problem I want to know where do I read what the definition of a "charge" is in the EEOC rules.                The three criteria that it has certain information in it can't be the rule.                      It can't be the rule because we already know that it isn't a charge if the person says I don't want it to become public. So, where do I read the rule that you just said?     That it -- an intake questionnaire that satisfies these three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects the manifest intent of the person who files it that it be a charge. You said that.          That's a pretty modestly clear rule, except it isn't totally.                      And they qualify -- where do I read that?              We use the word there "manifest intent"?                Ah.     Well, I read those regs, and those regs had a definition that can't possibly be right as applied to "intake questionnaire," because they make it a charge when the person says I don't want notice.      So we know that isn't the thing. I also know what you just said does sound like a rule.   I just want to know where to read it, because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an agency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule that is internally inconsistent.                 So, before I defer, I would just like to know where the clear rule that you stated can be found.                No, I just want to read it somewhere.              So that if I were not here having you in front of me, as many people don't have you in front of them, where I would go to read just what you said.               But you said there were going to be four places.          I want to write them down.              One is 48 Fed.       Reg.     148?              138.      Now, the other three.              Well, that's on the notice point.   Going back to the other, more important point, your words that I found quite useful are the "manifest intent," that shows a manifest -- are those words going to be in these four sources that I look up?              No.     I suspect not.              Therefore -- I'm --
06-134 +++$+++                 The problem that actually is bothering me with your side of the case which I find difficult is, suppose I accept this principle that you have.   All right, it seems to me anything at all can be reduced to a lien, any judgment, at least certainly slip and fall cases and you didn't keep the ice up in front and I want $4 million damages plus 300 million in punitives and where it is I have a lien against the embassy here.   And I can't think of a distinction once I go down your road.      I mean, he at least has an absolute distinction which I can see, but once I go down your road where is the stopping place?                What's the principle?              I'm imagining a city or Belarus or someplace where what they do is they say slip and fall on ice -- you know, you get a lien against the property prior to -- okay.          I mean, it's easy to imagine that kind of thing.              And in a range of subject matters.   So I'm looking to what the stopping place is once I start down your road.              I still have my question because I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't carry around in my head all of the possible things that might be liens against property.              And so maybe my imagination is wrong, but I want to know are you are arguing that every lien against the property is in fact a right in property which allows a lawsuit, or are you arguing that there is some distinction between some and the other.   And I noticed that the Restatements and others are trying to distinguish between whether the lien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't grow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to work with and so I want to know how you see it.              Can I -- can I can ask you to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into a muddle here. I'm still now being very, very literal.                     I think you're very literal and you say it says, a case in which is involved rights to property.                  And you say, but this is a right to property in this case; if I win this case then I have a right to sell that house.                  Therefore, I have a right in property. Now, if that's the reasoning why doesn't that apply to every case where a State might say if you win this case you can sell his house?                  I mean, I can easily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a State would say, you win, you can sell their house to collect the judgment.              So I'm still back in a different route at where I'm having the problem, which is a problem of distinguishing in principle between either your absolute principle, "do it," his absolute principle, "don't do it," or something in the middle.              The hypothetical was doing away with the prejudgment lien.             I would say the exact same words apply with just as much force if there is no prejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State were to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell this property to collect the judgment, is a suit in which there is at issue your right to sell his property, just as there is here.              Do you?
06-1413 +++$+++               That's not the question.    I thought that the -- I agree with the same question Justice Kennedy had.       Suppose that I'm a Massachusetts company that sells tables, and I sell some tables in Illinois.    And one day I take some of the money, and I buy an iron mine in New Mexico.               And then I sell the iron mine.    And Illinois, not Massachusetts, wants to impose a tax.    And suppose there is no connection whatsoever between the iron mine and anything else but for four, which are the four listed on page 13a: One, that I have contributed capital support to the iron mine. Two, I approve the major capital expenditures of the iron mine, sitting in my office in Massachusetts. Three, sometimes -- and this is a tougher one -- I call the iron mine a division of my table company. And, four, I sometimes retain tax benefits and control over the extra cash of the iron mine, but I'm not using it in my day-to-day work. Now, are those four things alone sufficient for Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine?                  That, it seems to me, is the way they presented it.                  Maybe it is a unitary business really, but I guess we have to send it back for that.               All right.       Then why isn't that the end of this case?           That's what they said it was.   That's what they said, perhaps wrongly, that this isn't a unitary business.           And, therefore, we are left with those four facts, and why not send it back and say you haven't reached the unitary-business question; go reach it?              What?       What?    What could it be?   That is -- as I read this, I thought, well, there is no separate test.      It's just there's a certain situation that comes up fairly commonly where someone claims that an asset of a company was really quite separate, and therefore when they get income from it or they sell it it has nothing to do with my business.                   And the answer is:   It did have something to do with your business, you used the working capital and so forth, in which case it's part of the business.                   So how -- how is it -- how is it different from that?              Well, if you agree with that, do you really agree, because if you agree with that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong to consider it separately, the lower court, and they should have reached the question they didn't reach, which was is this whole thing one single business, which is normally called the unitary business test?              Good.       All right.
06-1431 +++$+++              But is the rationale of those cases -- and it's important to get the right rationale.   If I say this and I'm wrong tell me I'm wrong.   And I thought that the heart of it is not that the retaliated -- the act of retaliation is discrimination.   It isn't.         What they say is when the white man helps the black man from being discriminated against, it falls within the statute, not because you've discriminated against the black man, but because if it didn't fall within the statute it would seriously erode or destroy the black man's right.                That's what it seemed to me Douglas said in Sullivan.             And so then we're looking very hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.
06-1456 +++$+++                You go back to Justice Alito's question.             I agree with you that you could read this as including a prohibition against a method of transportation which method is to hide the money.   You could.      But you could also read it the way that the question suggests, to refer only to the transportation.     So you transport it physically in order later to hide it. Now, the difference between the two is if we accept yours, which is the broader, this statute includes everything that has nothing to do with the common word "money laundering."                 Any time you hide something, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it to pay the couriers, you're money laundering.                 Any time you run a gambling operation and the people stick the money in the wad of their shoe, they're money laundering. I mean, why would you think Congress would want that narrow reading when it can be read to focus much more closely on money laundering just by reading it literally for what it says?              He purposely puts it in his shoe, okay.             It's a design.   He knows he's going to do it.       So -- and you're saying, I take it, 100 percent of the time that's illegal.              If you're not saying that, I don't understand what you're saying.             If you are saying that, I don't know why they call this statute "Laundering of Monetary Instruments."        Why didn't they call it "shoe hiding"? (Laughter.)              How does that show what you want it to show?     I mean, what I just heard you say is that Senator Biden said if we make it very tough to launder money in the United States, then criminals will send their money abroad to be laundered.              They'll transport it abroad in order to launder it.          How does that help you?              In order to launder it. Were they not talking about money laundering?              Or were they not talking about it?   I'm just going back -- I didn't read Senator Biden's statement, so I'm just curious.
06-1457 +++$+++  
06-1463 +++$+++               Well, the question is obvious.    The question just follows from what I said. You were there nodding your head when everybody seems seemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't go run off to court.       So you're just about to address this, and I hope you'll include the answer to the question, which is if they can't run off to the Federal -- to the State court judge, the superior court judge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they run off to this man, namely the talent agency expert --              -- who happens to be an administrative agency?        Why does it matter?              It sounds as if you made the argument -- well, you say we cited a case.              Okay.       The answer to Justice Souter's question is no, we didn't raise it below.   Is that right?              Could California law do this?     I mean could they say, you know, we have a problem.     By the way, this is just a hypothetical.                   We think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know very much about building disputes. Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent judges.     But California thinks, no, they don't know enough about it.     So here's what we do.                We say when Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to go to Federal -- they can go to the Superior Court.                      In fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the other one doesn't.      And everything is delayed while the Superior Court judge decides all the issues in the case. And then after they can go back to arbitration, if of course they still want to.           Could California do that?             I've read the agreement, and I don't quite find their -- here --             In my mind is what they do is they have the same standard arbitration clause.                   So I'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about California.             No.     The answer is no.     I thought so.    And so now you explain to me how this is any different than what I just said, other than substituting the words "Labor Commissioner" for "California Superior Court" and substituting the words "talent dispute" for the words "building dispute."               Well, I guess that would be a question for the arbitrator.              Right, this is -- this is -- actually now we are getting to the bottom of something here, I think. Now, I am beginning to understand where you are coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable support, as I -- as I agreed.              All right.              Now, Volt, however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not subject to arbitrability.              Therefore, it seems to me that the question here concerns the meaning of this contract, and that's where we started.              Does this contract mean that the parties who entered have promised, one, not themselves to go to court?         Answer:             Yes.              Two, not themselves to bring a proceeding before this administrative agency? And that's where he says yes, and you say no.              And then is the proper resolution of that to say:          Well, you can raise that, too, before the arbitrator?              Why not?
06-1498 +++$+++               All that makes -- makes it worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me anyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that all of the three things that you mentioned are only aspects of something much more fundamental that underlies all these cases --              Medtronics, drugs, all of them.     You came up and began and said this drug has side effects that hurt people.            And that's a risk when you have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts people. There's a risk on the other side.              There are people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't get the drug to them they die.                So there's a problem. You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time the drug can't hurt them. Now, who would you rather have make the decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people?                  An expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled randomly for a jury role who see before them only the people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need the drug to cure them? Now, that it seems to me is Congress's fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the agency.   And that's why we're here --                -- because you want the jury to do it.     And it seems to me, reading Buckman, that Buckman says the agency should do it.                So that's what underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as well get it right out so that you can answer.                Ms. Zieve, it doesn't object to a system where the -- a court -- the State would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really true that the agency would withdraw this drug.               But what you want is to be able to convince the jury that there was fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say there was fraud.    So what you're doing is removing a drug from the market that they want out there. Now, that's the theory of Buckman.                     The theory of Buckman is --              -- they want to save people whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't be there.   I overstate it slightly.                    So, explain to me why.                 Yes, but it will lead to the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be just as many people on the other side who are dying, dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get a necessary drug.     And that's why what worries me is what happens if the jury is wrong? You are absolutely right when you say you cannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a drug; and they are absolutely right when they say we cannot promise you that juries will be right.              So the the question is Who is more likely to be right?              Then you think they should be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a drug. Now, is that the law in most places?                   Where the FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor follows the label and the label is all okay, is it the case that somebody can come in and say, despite that, this drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation? This is a serious question.                   I'm not sure how it works.              So --              That's the next issue.              I see.              Why?      That's where I am missing you.    Why, then, does Michigan even have this thing?    In other words, why -- you are saying if they didn't have it at all, you would go ahead and bring your tort action.              Thank you.              So to me, which is a good answer, is you are saying:          Look at the basic tort system here.   And if you can do that, you can do this. Is that -- do you see where I'm --
06-1505 +++$+++  
06-1509 +++$+++                Well, it depends on what you mean by that.     The Ninth Circuit said, quote, about what he has to show, that he has to show not merely that the funds could have been a return of capital, but that the funds were, in fact, the return of capital "at the time of transfer." Then, they go on to say, since there was no evidence that they were considered, intended or recorded on the corporate records as a return of capital at the time they were made, then it isn't a return of capital. Now, I thought everybody thinks that's wrong, because you might have an absolute distribution that absolutely counts as a distribution to every shareholder in the corporation.              And at the time they all think the company's going to make a billion dollars, but it just turns out that they have a loss of a billion dollars, in which case at the end of the tax year that would count as a return of capital if the basis were high enough, and it would not count as a dividend.                    Am I wrong?              All right, fine.         So if we do not know, that's the end of the Ninth Circuit test, isn't it?   Because the Ninth Circuit test says:                  What we want to do is to look at the books at the time of the distribution and see if it is entered on those books as a return of capital.      That's how I read it.              No.     No.      It was not.   What they thought at the time they distributed it was fabulous dividends because we are going to be rich.              My example was they just made a little mistake.       Instead, the corporation is close to bankrupt, so there are no earnings or profits. Is it then a return of capital or not?                 The basis?       He has more than enough basis.      He has a $14 trillion basis, okay? So there is no problem about that.                 All right.       And so it is a return of capital.      So, therefore, the test is wrong.             Can I try a third example? Because I think an example might help. Let us imagine that the company distributes $10,000 on June 1 to every shareholder. Let us imagine that every shareholder has a basis of a trillion dollars in his stock.                 There is no problem about basis.        There is no problem about the nature of the distribution. Let us imagine they put in the corporate records on June 1:      This is a very valuable corporation; we are going to make a fortune; and this is a dividend. They write it down. Now, unfortunately, four weeks later the bottom falls out of the market, and it is not a dividend for the reason that they have no profits that year. Now, is it not under ordinary tax law a return of capital?                 Okay.                 If that -- once you say yes, then the Ninth Circuit must be wrong because the Ninth Circuit said we do not look to see what happens.                 A month later, we look just to see how it's characterized by the corporation at the moment of the transfer.              Well, that's what they said.              But we don't -- we are not certain on that one, I think, because of the cases he said before would this be a possible holding.             If it was a distribution in respect to the stock, and if he had sufficient basis, then if there were no earnings and profits in the corporation during the year, it would be treated as a tax deficiency -- no tax deficiency or it would be a return of capital.             Insofar as as the Ninth Circuit says something to the contrary, it is wrong. Now, if we remand to decide whether the -- whether he intended to prove and produced enough to show they didn't have the earnings and profits and also to consider the question of whether this was a distribution in respect to stock.              Does the Government have any objection to what I just said?
06-157 +++$+++               So in fact, you have -- just help me with one point here. I mean, I see that deciding what's incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult. I guess many of these cases would end up being decided on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or maybe sometimes there is. But I'd started thinking of the question of standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when the Government spends money in favor of one religion and not another.     After all, they led to the 30 Years War. We see that in other places in the world today.           People feel strongly.     And if, in fact, they have that terribly strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in the courts at all, and the Government can do what it wants without challenge. So in Flast, they carved out an exception, and the exception was where the taxing and spending clauses were involved, because Madison and others said this is aimed at "Government shall not tax and spend". So that was my theory.         And all we're saying is where there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't incidental, there's standing. Now we're worried about the merits.          Simple and clear.     To which the response was, which has me a little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice Stewart's position, or roughly speaking.                   But the Court rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later cases, they reject it too.         And therefore, whatever you might think of it, it isn't the law.                   And I'm not free to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance with what the cases say.        So what is your response?             I'd like you to focus on that.              So you're saying that what Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested at least what Justice Stewart said?              Is that right or not?             But not neatly, I mean, in terms of the purposes of the thing.                      Are your clients claiming that it would violate the establishment clause for the President to go to lots and lots of prayer breakfasts?             No.     I never met anyone who did, but I guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody might think that, I guess.            And I guess that if people -- there is some tendency of the people that are worried, you know, there are pro ses, there are all kinds of people, somebody could claim that.                      So you want a way to keep them out.              It's Justice Kennedy's concern.              But what they're worried about is will this word "incidental" and -- be sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow decide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous claim, that the President can't go to a prayer breakfast.    Now does the word "incidental" do that? That's what I think --
06-1595 +++$+++               Well, that isn't even -- look, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate with the police when they investigate individual instances. The best way to oppose sexual discrimination in the workplace is to cooperate with the employer when, in fact, he investigates individual instances. Is what I've just said English?                Does it make sense?     And indeed, I'm just quoting the EEOC's own definition.              It is your opinion.     The EEOC's opinion is, as they state, the best way to oppose is to cooperate. Now, what are we to do with, at least ambiguity, giving you that, I'll give you ambiguity.    But we have the agency charged with the enforcement of this taking the side of it that is the opposite side that you are taking.              It is a mix.       I mean, you know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of bad things.     They don't want their reputations ruined. They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they have to pay for it.       Oh the other hand, you have problems with your costs and you have problems dismissing people who should be dismissed.                   Everybody has problems in this area.            That's why we have law and lawyers.     They try to minimize it.                This doesn't seem fruitful to me.
06-1646 +++$+++               Well, going back to what you first said, suppose with your own children:                 I told you half an hour ago not to interrupt your sister when she is doing her homework.           This is the second time you've done it.    Wouldn't you, with your own child -- I would with mine -- think that the second time he did it was worse behavior than the first time?                  I just told him not to.             Well, if it's absolutely right I don't see why we hold Congress to some kind of weird -- not weird, but more picky standard than we do with our own children.             Because their behavior is worse.               That isn't what I tell my child.   I say you behaved worse.               Well, does the word "offense" -- I haven't come across it, but does the word "offense" have some kind of special technical meaning that doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into play all kinds of circumstances?              That's the part I'm not getting.     I mean, that's why it doesn't help your client.     In general, if you did read the word "offense" as applying just to the act of selling drugs, let's say, then you go on and it says, for which a maximum term of 10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is the maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling drugs?     And the answer would be 10 years.                   Now, how do you get out of that?               You're saying because -- because fewer people are likely to get the 10-year sentence than get the five-year sentence?               What is -- what is the distinguishing -- how do you get out of it?                   I know you're trying to say this and I'm just not getting it.             So it's bank robbery -- bank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines.                  If you have a gun, eight years.             If you brandish it, four more years.    If you take, you know, $10 as opposed to $50, two years, eight years, six years.                  The statute, by the way, says a max of 20 years.                Now, what's the -- what's -- does this fall within it?                      Doesn't it?   Does it depend on whether he brandished it?                      What does it depend on, in your view?             Or what he actually faced -- that, I agree with you, that won't work because of the guidelines, if they were mandatory.                     But what they're saying here is it's right in the statute.                      You just look at the statute that has the definition of what the offense is.             No, I'm back to the same question then.    I mean which one do we pick?              You see that my question is going in the exact opposite way.               What I am finding hard is once you distinguish offender and offense characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the max for the offense?      And so I'm asking you, how is it you get out of that?      Which is the same question I had before.   I'm not so worried about your case as I am other cases.
06-1666 +++$+++               But you have only the -- the citizenship to stop the floodgate.                    What I'm wondering is -- when I read the briefs, I put in my mind a spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of Japan, where there is basically peace but it's a military occupation.      On the other side, it's a hot war or a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up troops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas.                    And I had put this case quite close to the military occupation in my mind because of the nature of these particular individuals' offense and treatment.                    But was I wrong to do that?     Should I assimilate this case to either a hot war or at least a guerilla warfare, where troops are actively engaged in rounding up those who want to shoot them?              The question is, look, suppose the government comes in tomorrow, or in the district court, you're back there.                  And the government says you want us to release him.                At noon tomorrow, we will take him to the front gate and release him.                  Do you want us to do it?    Yes or no?               Yes?               Okay.              You need all that to win this case.   That is, as I started the case I thought this involved an American being held by the military for over a year pending the resolution of criminal charges in Iraq, which are charges of kidnapping in respect to which whatever hot war is going on over there has very little to do with his being held.              Well, you've been arguing for all sorts of things that seem far broader than that. So I'd like to focus you for a second on that matter.
06-1717 +++$+++               I think that the people in Congress who hired their staffs pay attention to what the staffs say in precisely the same way that any other executive --              I mean that wouldn't be surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14 sections and section of the B bill could have been vetoed -- been vetoed because of problem with Section 14 and repassed without Section 14, in which case the legislative history for the other 13 sections would be highly illuminating as to what they mean.              That's fine.        No problem. There is no other way to get paid for them. But where you have a cap, you should shove everything the other side, if expenses are going to be paid for it, because that cap means that the lawyer will not get his full pay back and therefore, the lower the cap, the more you want to be sure it's covering only that lawyer's time.     And everything else goes into expense so that you can pay the lawyer adequately and he will recover his expenses elsewhere. Was that the theory of this bill?                  Is there any evidence that that was the theory?                  If you did it that way, would anything get mixed up?
06-179 +++$+++                  How are they not conflicting?     Go ahead; go ahead -- elaborate.
06-219 +++$+++               Who would have thought -- wait.   When you say that, I mean, there's a lot of these acts, it seems, they are plainly illegal.              Well, if they are plainly illegal, then there are remedies in the courts.              All right.       But what is actually worrying you, which probably you can address at some point, is this:        There are remedies one by one. That's true.    And each has one.              And maybe you can even get injunctions against harassing.              Well, maybe he didn't do it.              And so it may be, they thought he did do it and --              All right.              Did you bring a suit for malicious prosecution?              All right.        Now --              Maybe he should have won. What's worrying me throughout, if you want to know --              What is worrying me throughout is, put this case to the side.                If the Court recognizes what I take it has not happened in the past, that there is an action for private people to bring against the government, Bivens, under the Fifth Amendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations, the coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of that will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim that what's going on with this regulation is there are individuals in the government who have gone too far, and they are just trying to get my property and the use of it, without paying a fair price.                Now by the way, sometimes people in government do go too far, so many of those claims might have some justification.                But suddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action becoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used unjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this kind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally legitimate government regulatory action.               You see, part of what's worrying me is that once you get into the Fifth Amendment, which is -- prevents the government from taking property for a public use without just compensation, the possibility of the legal imagination becomes endless.    Because every time a person walks across the doorstep, every time a person wants to install a pipe in the basement, read the meter -- I mean, I can see possibilities of actions of this kind arising, and particularly when the government wants to buy it and is pointing out all the reasons why it should be sold.   Is there a threat lurking in that conversation?   You see what I'm worried about here, which wasn't present in the other case?               No.     The reason would be probably that the, if you can make a comparison.                The number of Government actions that affect criminal charges and so forth are tiny compared to the number of governmental actions that affect people's property. Virtually, I mean the number of Government actions affecting how people use their property, it's the whole series of law books.      It fills the room.            And suddenly to open up a new remedy in that kind of thing is what's frightening me, which is what I said already.                So you don't have to answer.               Retaliation, what is retaliation?   Isn't retaliation statutory?               Well, the two cases you cite, the first one is the person who was charged with extortion is a judge --              And he was extorted on the ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant, so the money wasn't given to the government.            So I don't see that that's a difference.            And then the second case --              -- it may have been, but you say "See Also," which is a sign to me there's something wrong with that case. (Laughter.)              I'm surprised that you didn't put it first if there wasn't. Page 49.              Why did you say "See Also"?                 No, no.          You can go to an agency and say, agency I want to do such and such, dah dah dah, here are my reasons.               Agency says no.        I want review.                 I don't know.         You might have written to the Secretary of the Interior: Secretary, I want to you do such and such, please.                     No. Okay, review.                 And what happened?
06-278 +++$+++               Yes, but you rephrased it that way, but what actually happened is the principal looks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at what's supposed to be a school event with everybody together in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes a joke out of drug use.       The principal thinks of course adolescents and post-adolescents sometimes like to test limits, and if the kids go around having 15-foot banners making a joke out of drug use that really does make it a little tougher for me to convince the students at this school not to use drugs, and particularly putting up 15-foot banners.     I don't know why everybody wants to get away from that because I think you would have had a very different case if in fact it had been a whisper or if it had been a serious effort to contest the drug laws.   It wasn't either.          It was a joke.         It was a 15-foot banner.     We have the message plus the means plus the school event. Now, what's your response?                That's an excellent response, I think. (Laughter.)                I conceive that interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a school where kids go around at public events publicly making a joke out of drugs.              That's what his thought is. Now, I don't think he has to be able to read content discrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place. He doesn't know the law, the principal.                  His job is to run the school.    And so I guess what I'm worried about is a rule that would -- is on your side, a rule that takes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing limits all over the place in the high schools.                  But a rule that against your side may really limit people's rights on free speech.        That's what I'm struggling with. Now, I want some help there and I'm worried about the principal.               But I mean, that's -- I have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the teacher said.   The entire class went to view the relay. Individual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning. They were not given the option of remaining in class, nor were they released to do as they pleased.                 They were to watch the relay with the rest of the student body, either just in front of the school or just across the street -- that's me, not them -- and then return directly to their classrooms, which I guess the school did.   So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand together, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the teachers will be there and take you back to class.                          Now is there something else in the record that suggests something different?                Just tell me where to look. Where are the conflicting affidavits?                      I'm just reading from page 51 of the joint appendix.                       I didn't know there was a dispute.                Okay, I'll look at those. Another somewhat minor point.               Can I ask you another point about the record?          I'll read those.                No, they went across the street.             Was there any -- there was no requirement, they didn't have to go across the street or stay on campus, they could wander off distantly.             Okay.              Can I ask you another record point, just so I know where to look?              You've also asked for an injunction that would require expunging his 5-day suspension from his record.              10 days.         Well, 10 or 5, unclear.   I noticed the superintendent of schools on page 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is, "Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable because he was exercising his free of speech right. Even if I were to concede his speech across from the high school is protected, which I do not, the rest of his behavior warranted the suspension."                   And then he says, "And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.                   So given that, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you -- that it is protected and so forth -- then would you concede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's over, it still stands, I don't care about the expungement or not?             No, but I'm asking that you think about it.   I'm putting you on the spot.             I want to know what the superintendent said.      As I read it is, he says, look, I don't care if this was protected or not.                 I'll give you that.   It's protected.      But the rest of his behavior, the way he treated the principal, what he did, the reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a suspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. So it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5 days.   That's what the superintendent says. Now suppose you win your point that you're interested in winning, which you may not or you may. Are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5 days, that that should be erased?              You couldn't what?       I didn't hear the last part of what you said.                  You just got to the point of --              Yes.      What's the answer?              So you would not pursue it?             Why does it matter?   That is, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that principal really reasonably thought the situation was? I mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of the school group, if the principal reasonably thought that this was a school outing, if the principal reasonably thought that students are staying together, why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take the case, we should take it that way, because the principal reasonably thinks?             But even on the merits?              Even if the principal couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if he really wasn't?
06-313 +++$+++                Can I ask you, where -- one of the passages that I thought went a little far where is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to into your head; this is far more important than William Weaver.    This case goes far beyond William Weaver.                  This touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the world.    That's the message you have to send.                  It just doesn't pertain to William Weaver.                    It pertains to all of us, the community.         The message -- there are street, et cetera. Okay.    Now.       That struck me, as you argue this is rather extreme.       Its seems to be removing the attention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you have a duty to send this man for other reasons.                Now -- to execute him. But where do I find in the U.S. reports the case or statement that then says this is the kind of argument the prosecutor cannot make?               You were talking --             Suppose that you said explicitly, the prosecutor -- which he didn't say -- but you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug dealers around, and he's one of them.                    And this sentencing phase isn't about just -- just isn't about William Weaver.    It is about sending a message to the others. And if you execute him, even if you think he shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should be, but, you see, others will think that this is a message.   So do it just to give a message.                  Even if you think he never did it.       No matter what you think of him, you think he's the best person in the world.                   Still execute him just to send a message. Now would that violate the Constitution?              Yes.      Of course.     What case in the Supreme Court would you look to to show it did?              You don't find any one where anybody ever had an argument like that.              Ah.     Ah.      So you are saying we should look not just to -- if we try to look for exact, identical arguments maybe we'll get into that problem?   Of having to uphold things we all know -- or is that right?   Or what?
06-340 +++$+++                 That isn't the -- what I'm trying to figure out with Justice Kennedy's questions and your answers is, is there really an issue here?                        And I'm beginning to see maybe there is an issue when you said what are they talking about.                    Can you -- it's a cactus.    They're kidnapping cactus, as apparently happens.     And if in fact this cactus, if the thing is transferred to the State, that cactus is going to disappear.     Now that isn't fish.                It isn't wildlife.         It isn't water.     It's a cactus. So can you take that into account?                     Is that theoretical?     I think they're trying to raise this question of, suppose you know the IRS, that if you mail a refund check at the time, the person who gets it is going to use the $500 to destroy the last salamander in the world.     Okay?    Now there we are, endangered species. Does the Act apply to the IRS?                  I would have thought the answer's no.              And then I would have thought the same reasoning is true here, but what the Act tells you to do is read your existing authority, but read it in light of informed by the endangered species objectives language, et cetera. And now I wonder if with that approach, is it possible that even the cactus could fall within the nine criteria?     You're not going to depart from them but you're going to read them generously in light of the objective of the Endangered Species Act, which is itself an environmental objective.              Now how does that work? Can you do that?     You're an imaginative lawyer.                Can you do it?              All right.       The answer is you can.   Then are you satisfied with this result in this Court?    One, it can be read that way.                 They're not going to agree with that.            It can be read that way, and therefore, it applies.         The ESA, the Endangered -- Two, that means they consult. But three, the result of the consultation here which has been done means there's no real objection to the transfer, because it's virtually inconceivable given the weapon that the EPA has, withdrawing permits, given a memorandum of agreement, given the possibility of supervision, given the fact that the wildlife service will object, writing them a letter or a phone call immediately, given all that stuff, there's simply no reason to believe that Arizona will fail to protect endangered species.               So what's your view of an opinion that roughly wrote what I just said?             Before you say why you didn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of expected you might agree when I though maybe you have hooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on. But it was the other half, which I think is what Justice Stevens is saying now.                I read through this record, not completely but pretty well, and I couldn't find a single thing that would suggest that Arizona presents any risk to you.            And so, what is the risk to an endangered species that you're actually worried about there?   And you rather -- I didn't think you'd like to agree with that, but I want to press you to find out what actually is the problem.                And how would that happen? How would it happen that they would get rid of the flycatcher in Arizona, considering the fact that they have laws themselves that protect endangered species, and that's a bird, and a bird is wildlife; and so if they decide they want to kill all their flycatchers, which I would doubt, you could intervene at EPA and stop them.   So how is that actually a problem?
06-376 +++$+++               Yeah, but is there any other instance in the law?            I suppose there probably is, but what surprised me about that is this:                 Imagine we have two citizens and they are identical in every respect in terms of their claim, they each believe the government owes them $50,000.               They each have identically strong claims.            And Congress passes a law and says one of you can come into court and the other can't.   Now suppose it said the poor person can't come into court.    Do you think there wouldn't be a constitutional problem there?               Remember, they have the same claim for the same amount, with the same precise strength of their argument.              But we say rich people can go in, and we'd say why did you do that?                         We say poor people don't have as much stake in society.                         They don't have -- now suppose you heard such an argument.                         How long would it take you to feel there's a constitutional problem?               No.     No.       No.    The rational basis is that the poor person doesn't have the stake in society that a rich one does.             Yeah.             But at the end of the day, the claim happens to be interest worth $5,000.                 The IRS abused its discretion under the statute in failing to write a check for $5,000 to both.                 What we do is we allow one of them to bring a lawsuit to get the 5,000, and we say to the other one, you can't bring the lawsuit to get the 5,000. Now my question is, what's the basis for that distinction?             Why would there be no hardship?               And so can a poor person.               By the way, this has nothing to do with the progressive income tax.              What I have not seen anywhere is the use of wealth, totally different from the dollar value of a claim, to shut the courthouse door.    I'm just saying, is there such a case anywhere, and if there is no such case, then I'd say I wonder about this assumption.              The assumption that the reason that you cannot keep the courthouse door open to everyone is because what?               What.             We know, attorneys' fees you give to poor people more than to rich people.                  That makes sense.    That has nothing to do with having a formal rule saying you cannot enter the courthouse.             I don't understand.             Wait.       That might be the answer.              Wait.       Wait.   There are two separate things.     I want to understand this.                 In other words, the Secretary does not have the power to abate the interest in respect to the rich person?              Oh.              He can do it -- in the first case with the rich person, he can abuse his discretion.              In other words, in the one case Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person you cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person you can abuse your discretion.               That's what the underlying substantive statute says.              I now think maybe I don't agree on this point that there are different standards, because it does say in this abuse of discretion.                      And indeed that's a normal administrative standard, and so as you read this you would think that the IRS does not have any legal power substantively to abuse its discretion in refusing to bring an abasement in refusing to bring an abatement -- excuse me, to abate the interest.     So far do you agree?              Once they make clear that the standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear what's there in the law anyway, that administrative authorities do not have the authority to abuse their discretion.     Now, sometimes we don't review that in the courts.     That doesn't make it legal.                   It just means you can't catch them out in court.              So there's a standard that applies to everybody.        Then all that this does, to go back to it is it closes the courthouse door.                Now I want to know what your rationale was for doing that?                It had nothing to do with the standards that applied.                It has to have something to do with why one class of people by wealth are kept out of court.              I think if it were the other way around it wouldn't last for three seconds, and the only reason maybe I don't think about it as hard this way because I think, well, privilege is involved, etcetera.   But when you force me to think about it, I want to know what the reason so.               I'll accept that characterization.     Now you give me the reason why we've opened the courthouse door to individuals who are alike in every respect but for their net worth?                Now give me that, the same reason?        I always want to know what the specific reason is, the specific rationale and.                I'm not saying there isn't one.         I just want to know what it is.
06-413 +++$+++               The law on this, and you've read the cases more recent probably -- I've skimmed through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you have.     And the statement of the law that I want to know, is it still valid law, is in Witherspoon on 522, Justice Stewart in the footnote.           And what he says in that footnote is, "the most that can be demanded of a venire man in this regard is that he be willing to consider," and those are his italics, "to consider all of the penalties provided by State law, and that he not be irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge.                      If the voir dire testimony in a given case indicates that venire men were excluded on any broader basis than this, the defendant's sentence cannot be carried out."                 Is that still a valid statement of the law or has it changed?              Of Washington law.          No, this is Justice Stewart of the Supreme Court.              This doesn't say -- that's one of the things it says.            But the other is, "the most that can be demanded of a venire man is that he be willing to consider" -- that's the word that's italicized -- now, is there any -- "and if you exclude him on a broader ground than that, the death sentence cannot be carried out".          Now, is there anything in any later case that suggests a change in that respect?
06-427 +++$+++               What was the evidence?              What was the evidence?              I mean, at this late date, you've had trials.      You're saying -- did you ask?             With all these people under oath, haven't you had trials and everything?              Did you ever ask the people who were at the meeting, what was the evidence you considered that we haven't had a chance to see?                Did you or not?                And then, and what did they say?                All right.       So there were some notes taken by investigators, which did they have anything new in them you hadn't seen before?                What was in there that you had not seen before in the notes?                I'm asking you in the notes that were presented to the decisionmaker that you had not previously seen and therefore had no opportunity to rebut?       What particularly and specifically?    And it's surprising to me that you hesitate at this very late date if this is a serious issue.              What did it say in the notes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you did not have a chance to reply to specifically?              What you learned was the investigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you previously did not know that, and if you had known that you would have said to the decisionmaker:                  The investigators did not speak to Mr. King.                  And if you had said that, how would this case be different?              And the other side says, Mr. Bart King was part of the school and had something to do with this?              Is that right.              Well then, I don't understand what the relevance of this is.              But I don't understand what Mr. King has to do with this if the other side is not claiming that Mr. King is part of your operation.              Who considered it?             Did you ask the people on the board of control, what role did Mr. King play in your decision?             So that they might have reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been under the mistaken impression that Mr. King had something to do with you when he did it.             And the probation was -- and the probation, which was for four years?             And have you served the four years.             So there is three more years?   So if in fact you are correct that they were under a misapprehension on this matter, then the thing to do would to be find out if that extra three years had something to do with this erroneous thing of Mr. King? It's surprising to me all of this is coming up now, but there we are.   So but that's your specific claim.               I thought it was a different claim.   I thought you were claiming there was a violation of due process because an investigator spoke without you present to the board.               And that I would think was not a violation of the Constitution since it happens every day of the week in administrative agencies.            But if you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen. And I think in that you're saying the Administrative Procedures Act is unconstitutional, which would be a surprising claim to me.             Thank you.

06-457 +++$+++                May I ask you this question, which is where I'm having a little trouble on your side.   I think I would agree and you would agree that if the State were to say, to protect the consumers in our State, anyone who ships in goods must do so in special padded cars -- use whatever shipper you want, but you have to have special -- that would be illegal.               Can California say, anybody who ships lettuces into our State has to use refrigerated equipment?          One product, not all products, and a good public health reason?               So you'd say that would also be preempted?
06-480 +++$+++               The Internet -- is it -- you would have said four years ago, or I think we are in this argument, you would have said that it's the large discounters, the growing discounters, the Walgreen's of the world who want to get rid of retail price maintenance, it's there to help the mom and pops.                  Okay. They're in now, they're big, and they may want to maintain resale prices because they may want to extract the other profit, while the Internet little company comes in and says I can get it to you cheaper. Now I can imagine circumstances like you say.    I can imagine they're not like you say.                I don't know.    And so what should I do if I really don't know?
06-484 +++$+++               The most suspicious thing in the complaint that I could find was where you say there's an internal market report, and it revealed demand for the 5500 was drying up, and revenue would decline by 400,000,000.         Then you date that with in or about early '01.   Now, I think if you knew or had reason to believe that it was prior to March or April of '01, you would have said so.              Yeah, and therefore, there's quite a good chance here that this report was written after he made the statements. What am I supposed to do with that?                  I mean, I know what you said.        And you said your best.              And that's your best.               What's the difference between what Justice Scalia was just saying?                You can't come into Federal court unless you have at least $200,000 damages.    Now, you might have been just as much hurt if you had less, but that would be constitutional. So here you can't get into Federal court unless you have a really strong claim, an overwhelming claim that you have to demonstrate at the beginning. Now, you might have a good claim, but we're not going to let you come into Federal court.                We only want those people who are really strong, just as we only want those people who are really suffering.                No.     No, not the burden of -- it's the entry.             That's true, but imagine a case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on both sides. And then you read that document and you conclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I do think a reasonable juror could find for the plaintiff. And that would be the weak evidence standard. And lo and behold, that could be -- you know, what do we do about that?                Because using your do you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine cases where that meets the weak evidence standard, the weak inference and not the strong inference.                   And what I'm driving at is, I don't see a way of avoiding this Seventh Amendment problem.              Because they certainly didn't intend the weak inference standard.              What do you think about the approach -- because I have had some of these cases.                      And I see -- I think words, words, words. And what Congress said was strong inference, and we're not going to get any further by looking for some other words.    So therefore, take strong inference. The most helpful thing is take it, look at the complaint, read it, and then say okay, this is a strong inference.   Or maybe we'd say it isn't.                     We read it, and avoid all the other issues.             What do you think about that?               Yeah, and so I think we have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if imported into the pleading would always mean a strong inference.   You see, that's -- that's the dilemma.            And I don't see how to remain true to the words of the statute which are strong inference, without actually producing a dichotomy.         And so either Congress can do it or it can't, and -- and -- and that's -- and we could fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment. But I don't --
06-5247 +++$+++               Suppose we apply Brecht. This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd appreciate your commenting or straightening this out. The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG in the briefs.     He states them very well.              The first is let's look at this witness.              The testimony was excluded. Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was unreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, because that testimony of the witness that was excluded was not only material, it would have substantially bolstered the claim of innocence.    So that's their finding on the merits. Then they go on to say, but the exclusion was harmless. How could both those things be true?              How could it be true that the reason that there was error in excluding it was that the evidence is so important that it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence? That's one thing they say. But the exclusion was harmless.              I just fail to understand how anyone could think both those things. But maybe in the context of the case it was possible, but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.              So --              Go ahead.             But what she heard was that they were going to kill, this other person was going to kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was the crime at issue.             What did she hear?             Do you think -- do you think, do you think I should do this?                    I'm still looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are, having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a mistake for a judge and then you never finish a proceeding.    I'm worried about that, as are you.               At the same time, I think what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge. Not what -- quite what the test says. So there has to be a conscientious effort to decide, was there -- was it harmless?                     Could a reasonable jurist in California have concluded the opposite?    Okay. So maybe we should do it in this case.                 We simply try ourselves to go through this record, make that determination to show by example, rather than by trying to find a form of words.
06-5306 +++$+++                 What about something here I hadn't run across, called the unique circumstances doctrine.   This Court in Osterneck said this:             Where a party has performed a act which if properly done would postpone the deadline for filing his appeal -- and indeed that's what happened here; he postponed the deadline for filing his appeal -- and has received specific assurance by a judicial officer that this act has been properly done -- and here he did receive specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act was properly done -- in those circumstances, you can make a little exception in the interests of justice.             Yes, yes, the act was that he filed a motion to reopen, which motion to reopen postponed the time of appeal.             And two things have to happen with that act.      One is you have to get the district judge to agree; and second, you have to file the paper. So that's the act which if properly done would, in fact, have led to the appeal.             I agree there were two parts to it or two acts, if you want.               Why does that matter?          I mean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case that took place on Tuesday.            This case took place on Thursday.   I mean, I grant you the language literally you could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what?                 The purpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what to do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo and behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing and you didn't get it right. Now, that seems to be its purpose, and the language is very close, so why not follow it?              I notice the court applied it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique circumstances.              Well -- in criminal.              But in -- though of course, you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into the rule.     So there is a statute and you read the statute as saying well there could be very some very narrow circumstances that Congress would have been willing to make an exception.               For example it is a couple of days and the judge tells you, "do it" or lets you do it.     It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?              What do you think, if we did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a case in which the judge simply said from the bench look, your -- your -- the new trial motion is timely, though it wasn't; it was out of by two days.                  While here, we have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered with a -- you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you have till the 27th to file.
06-531 +++$+++                I thought that it -- am I wrong about that?    I thought that if, A, he goes in, he gets a preliminary injunction, he says the law is da, da, da, the judge says you're right, that's what it is, preliminary injunction.         And now it's continued up on appeal, the appellate court says you're wrong about the law.   You got it, you had the event, but you're absolutely wrong, the law did not support you.                      I thought under those circumstances you were not prevailing and you couldn't get it.                      Is that the law or not?                Is there any authority for that?   Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a person has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally unsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they appeal that and the court of appeals determines it's legally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it, I'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee in those circumstances, but maybe there is.                What is it?                Is there any case you can think of that under those circumstances let's him have the attorney's fees?             No, I would be surprised.             The other thing that I wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party? And the reason I ask that is because when I look through the record it seems to me your clients are very interesting.   They have their point of view.               And their point of view, one of their points of view was that the state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a skimpy swimming suit.      No.      Well, you can have the demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want to see you don't have to see you.                And there your client said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth.                At least we didn't in the past.       And then looking at that I thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up the cloth.   It was pretty clear the State would, and it should have been pretty clear that they were going to ignore it, which they did. And why is this any different than having won an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but in your swimming suit?         In other words, they didn't want this.     They didn't want what they got.                    Now, what's the response to that?                 Well, before you leave that, I wonder if -- there's one other thing floating around in my mind.      I might as well bring it up.            The word is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground that it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things, at least you have to really be prevailing, is there a good faith element in that?              That is to say, if your clients when they went in to get this order and they got it, and at that time they had no intention of following what they had to do.        Rather, they had every intention of going out and tearing down the curtain.                Does that enter into the determination of whether they are really a prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's fees, if you're bringing the ethical element into it?
06-5618 +++$+++                What do you think about taking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly hypothesizing this -- and following up with what Justice Stevens said.        You'd say look, one thing a district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe the guideline is right for a typical case.                And I think this is a typical case.          And I won't follow the guideline.   You couldn't think those three things?               So one big power a judge has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to say the guideline itself is unreasonable.                 So we're -- let's just say -- and there if they say that, the district judge could decide whether or not, the court of appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not reasonable.     But leave those cases aside.               I imagine they'll be few and far between. Now we take one they assume is reasonable. And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three things.     One, to give the kind of thing that -- the reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits is reasonable for a typical case.                  So what's the kind of thing that leads you to think yours is not typical?                    And he says it.    And then he has the evidence as to the related facts.     And then he has the degree of departure. As to the first thing, the court of appeals could review it and decide whether it is or is not the kind of thing.     As to the second and third, they also could review it but only after giving considerable weight to what the district judge thinks about the case in front of him. Now maybe that's -- I mean, you might not have a reaction to that.           I'd have to sort of think about it.              Not quite --              That's the other thing I'm not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means. That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something, but proportional to what?          I mean, I can think of two problems.   One problem, of course, is that the chart in the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to 10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to 30, it's 2 years. Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just have nothing to do with your reason for departure.               You might have added on something for having a gun and your reason for being lenient might have to do with the person's having a gun.        So you're going to say it make a difference whether you were high up or whether you were low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to do with whether you're high up or whether you were low down?   You see?   It doesn't actually work, I don't think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to say what's proportional.               Well, why use the word "proportional," because the other thing is what the Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason justify a little departure rather than a lot?              And if he has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot just as much as it might justify a little?              That's the part, they said that.   An extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances.              What worries me about that it sounds like a slogan.           I would think an extraordinary reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that justify the extraordinary reduction, period. And it also sounds like you're going to start getting a mechanical set of charts and things, which is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force of generative law which would worry me quite a lot because I just think it's too complex to reduce to a formula.    What you want is a reason that supports the sentence. It is --
06-562 +++$+++              How?      I'm not so sure because -- unless you want to stipulate that that restitution -- if you want us to write in the opinion that in fact in a 107 action if one of the parties sued has entered into a settlement he shall have precisely the same protection from suit as if it were a 113 action.   Do you want to say that or not?             Well, I would worry about the equity.    I just want to know if you want to stipulate that that's the proper interpretation, because I could easily imagine a case where your client bought a beautiful golf course and he wants to turn it into a golf course.   Unfortunately, there's a little mess under there and he spends $10 million on that.                    And he says the real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to sue them because they're the ones who dumped this and they've cost me $9 million.            And it turns out that Union through precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has settled this very matter for one dollar with EPA. Barred?               Ah, that's what I thought, and that's what he's saying.            That's what he's saying, that's why he has brought his second acorn, because he said there's a huge difference here.                    What you will do is if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court as to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle with the Federal Government you're home free.               How are you going to choose this?   Because he is, I think you're -- maybe you're in a slightly awkward position because the Government is saying that one of the reasons that you're stuck with 113 is because Congress didn't really want through 107 to give parties like your clients an opportunity to review for fairness or equitable principles, whatever you like, the settlements that had taken place with the defendant in EPA.    And that's so we can get people to settle, among other things.             They feel they're home free. Now, you have two choices here.              I think you could say, one, well, that's the way it is, we should have a 107 action and we should review these settlements for fairness; or two, you could say one of the principles of fairness is the principle that's written into 113 about no review, and we're happy with reading that into 107.   So which is it that you would like to say?                 When you say that's absolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have that choice, or is it --                 All right, so then he's wrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this action is to permit people to get equitable review of prior settlements?      What you simply want -- and you're not interested in that; you'll go with no equitable review of private settlements.                Read 113 into it.   You want the right to bring the case where there has no settlement and Government has done nothing.
06-571 +++$+++               This is what -- this is what is bothering me about your side of this case.                       I start thinking this is a total fluke.                    Normally, you would charge him under "possession in furtherance of," which you didn't for reasons I don't know.                    Or he would be an accessory, which he isn't here because the other side was a government agent.             So we've got a fluke. Now, if I accept your linguistic approach, I don't know what I'm getting into.                 Imagine an artillery team.    One loads the ammunition; the other pulls the trigger.    We say the team used the ammunition, but the guy who pulled the trigger by himself didn't. Think of a baseball team.                   The pitcher doesn't use the bat, but the team does. Now, if I take your linguistic approach, where am I in respect to other statutes?                    But if I deny your linguistic approach on the ground that it's unnatural to say "use" of the -- the individual used it, all I've done is create a fluke case because it will never come up again.              But those are all examples that I used the gun to pay for the item.                 You don't use the word "use" when you're the seller.                 It doesn't fit.              Is -- is there any reason in such a case, if you lost this case, in the future could you not just charge, as Justice Alito said, that they're a principal in the possession by the seller?              If the government is not involved?   And if the government's involved on the other side, I guess you'd have to charge an attempt.              And so your -- your practical argument then is that there has been considerable reliance on your interpretation to the extent that many people have been convicted under it. How many?              About?           About?   Have any rough idea?
06-5754 +++$+++               Are we back to the original version, which I'll read what it says.                  It says:   "With a few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case."              That's what it said.        A part of the guidelines in the heartland.                  If it's not the heartland, depart. Now, what I wonder is are we not back under your theory of it just to where we were when it started out, before the commission started ruling all these things out and began to make all its -- the judge could do that.               We said we took nothing into account and therefore any circumstance that makes the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an exception.               You're saying more than that is necessary.               He could do this set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take account of sentencing.        But suppose he doesn't do that. Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the guideline?                 I know, but Booker says what we're trying to do is to come close to what Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment. Now, what I think we're talking about now -- I think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you clarified something very well for me, which is that in this case we're talking about the situation where the district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you have to -- you better show me a good reason to think to the contrary.   Fine. But the interesting problem is the problem of the next case which you're now talking about, is, well, what happens if the district judge and when should be the district judge and how free should the district judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence even if it's not an unusual case.                It's not that complicated. All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 percent of the defendants in the typical case have been in the Army.    And therefore, we think that just ordinary armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed -- services in the military is not a reason for a diminished sentence.       That's all, period.                Or they can say it the other way, the absence of a military service is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any way you want.   And by the way, district judge, if you disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because we think it's unreasonable.             Okay.       What about that?                It did.          But is there anything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?                Well, what do you think? Because I would think that if you're going to answer that question yes, you are saying that not even the court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness among different defendants in respect to sentencing.             It's not sub-legal rules. What it's called is precedent.               What you do is you decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you decide it the same way.         And if a district judge doesn't follow that, you reverse it.             Exactly.         You've simply substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the district court following circuit law for the guidelines. And --             If the guidelines are unconstitutional because they make facts automatically determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional because it makes facts automatically determinative.               Well then, in other words, the Constitution of the United States prevents the courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences who are -- that individuals who are in similar positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in similar ways.   That to me is possible, but of course I've been in dissent in these cases.                    But it seems to me --               We're back --
06-593 +++$+++                  Was that later?                 How much later?                 No, no.          I thought that the provision that was -- what is the number -- - where they say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many years later.                 I mean, you read --                 You read 3 and 3 says what you said it says.     All right.            How much later did they promulgate 109?              That's what I thought.         So the same day they say, 3, you have to have these domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, and then in 109 they say you don't.              All right.       Now, why is that a conflict?     Let's imagine -- it sounds like a conflict.     But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation that says birds for purposes of this are animals that fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, penguins don't and they're still covered.                   I mean, why is that a conflict?       There are lots of specific situations.     If I read that, I would have thought, well, okay, they have an exception.              Did Congress intend to cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they live in their house, there's only one way to keep them from having to go to an institution.                   Their children hire a companion to look after them.                   Now, that's a third party.              Because?             It doesn't say that.         It says "about, in or about a private home of the person by whom he is employed."       I live in San Francisco.            My mother lives in Massachusetts.               Now, if I hire a companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom she is employed.    So if we're being literal and if you win this case, I don't see how -- and I'm worried about this, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably very common, that all over the country it's the family, the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so they don't have to be brought to an institution. And if you win this case, it seems to me suddenly there will be millions of people who will be unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who will move to institutions.           Now, if I were to say that that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a legal point because it's a question of what people intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the truth.   It is a very worrisome point.               And there are many -- maybe Justice Scalia has the answer.             Since we're into that, we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that possibly they had -- they promulgated the whole thing pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular statute, because that's what it says in 552.2.                 It says "this part" -- it doesn't say subpart, it says part -- and part is 552.   And both regs we are talking about are in the part.   And B says interpretations, but they don't mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in them, and divide by 32.        Nobody thinks that Congress meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide by 33. So as I read that, I thought the whole thing is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; Part A has more general things.              Part B has more specific things.   Where am I wrong?              All of them.     All of them is what it says unless I missed something.                 Okay.       I got the point.                 Right.           Right.
06-618 +++$+++               Well, it could or couldn't be.   I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator, says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this individual is the individual's performance that revealed itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House, and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of the case, they can't bring it?              Well, all he'd have to say is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person. Now, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury matter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that into account.   If it's something the jury is entitled to take into account, you are questioning what that Senator did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it in another place, namely, a court.              Can we go back a step.       I just -- you said this is appealable and your reason for it being appealable was because the statute itself -- you said it was not appealable and the reason not is because the statute itself said that this has to be applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?              That's your reason.       So I take it, what about the reason that's been given, that this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face? What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?              No, no, no, I'm not asking about the argument you are making.                I want to ask about an argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll ask about the one you are making in a second.                The reason I want to know about -- I want to know about the other possible reason for not being appealed, namely that this is as applied and not on its face.             They don't strike down any provision.         What's your view about that one?              That is correct.   And what you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?             So then a holding of a district court in your opinion, the holdings say, imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter having to do with legislation falls within this Act because that would violate the speech and debate clause. That would be quite major in its implication.                But you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as applied.             Does that mean if I go to your argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this appellate provision at law, because the only reason that anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area, at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate Clause violation.    So in that interpretation of the statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.
06-6330 +++$+++              Well, that's because of the cliff.   But the cliff is undoubledly a negative, but the cliff is not as important as sometimes suggested, for the numbers after all, which relate punishment to amounts of drug, reflect, (a), more seriousness than what you have -- I mean more people likely to take it -- but also the role that the person is likely to play in the organization, high or low, and the likelihood that he is or this -- these groups of people are big deal offenders or not, and many other things. Therefore, a system that really is basically flat or only rises slowly until you get to the cliff, and then it again rises slowly to the next rise, is not an irrational system.       It depends on what those other correlations are.    I say that because suppose a judge, noticing the horrendous effects of this -- that the commission itself has listed and understanding that cliffs are not the end-all and the be-all of Guidelines that are rough correlations, suppose a judge said:               My system, which we have before us, which doesn't have the absolute numerical progression, is far more reasonable than the commission's system.              There it is.   He's reviewed the commission's policy. Well, Rita says sometimes courts could.                And so what is the law that forbids the judge from doing that, at least on occasion?              No, because Congress has nowhere said that you can't have cliffs. You see, Congress could say, our rough judgment is that 5 Gs of hard -- of crack really is kind of a correlation with a medium-level gang, and 50 Gs is probably a correlation with a fairly high-level gang. And what has Congress actually thought about this? Nothing.    They never thought about it. So I can't find an instruction there that tells the commission that they can't do it this way.              They wanted to abolish the whole thing.              Why?      Why?      That's my question.     Everyone's assuming that "consistent with the statute" means a sentencing system that's smooth without cliffs.     And I'm sure every mathematician would agree with you, but I'm not at all certain that prosecutors and defendants who have actual experience in this would agree with you, because there are lots of arguments that it's perfectly consistent with the objective of the stat tute to have a few cliffs.              If Congress passes a statute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of eight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully, does that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun? (Laughter.)              At the cliff.       But, of course, I've been through -- I hope not being hypnotized by numbers myself -- that these numbers reflect underlying realities that are far closer to the shotgun case than you are prepared to admit.
06-637 +++$+++              But they have (b).          What about (b)? See look, there are two situations. Situation (a) is that the school district thinks they can give them a good education, adequate.                     Then he should go and try it out, and if by the way the school district just can't do it, then (b).                     So what's been wrong with that scheme?         Why doesn't that cover the waterfront?             Just the language -- the language.             The language plus the fact that nobody can think of a reason for putting that in there, unless that's the --             But my question was what about (b)?   My question was not to argue with you.            My question was, why doesn't (b) take care of the examples of absurd situations, law situations that you've mentioned?             The case where the school district just can't do it.             If they just can't do it then their job is to put the kid in a district --             -- in a place that can do it.   And if their argument, which is your case, is it they object to the facility, then have an argument about that, about whether it should be this private school or that private school.      That's what it seems to me your case is about, and that's why I think B.              (b), that's my question, (b).   I thought you were right.             Until I heard that. Then I suddenly hear no, that don't worry about it, judge, is what I heard, because in the situation where the school district has not provided there is another section of the statute that takes care of the child. That's what I want to hear your response to.
06-6407 +++$+++               What's your opinion, then, how this is supposed to work?               A person has been on death row for ten years, perfectly sane, no problem. He's going to be executed next month.                     Tomorrow he becomes catatonic, absolutely insane, no doubt about it, and now it is unconstitutional to execute such a person. Nobody denies that.       All right, now what's supposed to happen?              I don't want you to agree with me.   I want to know what you think should happen.              And what's your opinion, because I didn't memorize every page.                   I read it.   So what's your opinion how that works?              So your opinion is -- and then is that constitutional, if in fact Congress passes a statute and says there will be no court review of a person who clearly the Constitution forbids to execute, the State to execute him.          Nobody doubts that.          Nobody doubts this is an unconstitutional execution, but there will be no court review of a decision to the contrary. Is that constitutional?              I know that's not --               Well, why not?       Why not? Because we have, after all, a claim that the Fifth Circuit has as a general matter misapplied the standard of this Court's cases as to what counts as insanity for purposes of the Constitution.               Now, you say this blocks it, but it doesn't block a direct writ for habeas, so why not?    It's an important general question.                 Someone may be executed whom the Constitution forbids to have executed.   Why not?               Would you object if we do that?              Because?               There's also the substantive part, that is, I think there's also an argument that the district court here, and the court of appeals, applied not just Justice Powell, but Marshall's even stronger, and they took -- they say about the same thing in Ford, I didn't see much of a difference, but if there is, take Powell. And it seems to say, the Fifth Circuit following, that if you can answer the question yes, prisoner, are you being executed?                 Yes.     What does that mean?   I'll die.   And why are you?                Because I committed a murder.   That that's the end of it.                   And they say explicitly, it doesn't matter if the next thing the prisoner says and the reason that's going to happen is because of the wild dogs.           You say, what do you mean? The wild dogs are manipulating the minds of all of the State officials, all the witnesses, because I'm a victim of the wild dogs forever.           And you have 15 psychiatrists and they absolutely prove that's what he thinks, and he thinks that this is all about dogs. Now should he have that delusional system, as I read the Fifth Circuit and the district court, that happens to be irrelevant as to whether he is insane and can't be executed.      Now I can't read Powell and Marshall as saying that, so they're saying it's clearly contrary to Powell and Marshall, that sounds like a substantive claim, and they say correct the Fifth Circuit please. What about that one?             But suppose you went back. You see, you say it's just Justice Powell.               But Marshall said for the Court, today we explicitly recognize that it has been, for centuries, is abhorrent to exact in penance the life of one whose mental illness prevents him from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or its implications. So that sounds like a stronger statement than Powell.     So you add Marshall to Powell, and you get a court.     It isn't just Powell.             And I agree with you that I don't know that that standard you just enunciated about the rational one is the right test.                  Maybe the right test is just to repeat these words from Powell or some others.     But I think their claim is whatever that is, the Fifth Circuit's been using the wrong test.              That may be.      So maybe the thing to do is to send the case back to the Fifth Circuit and say you've been using the wrong test, this is the right test.      Do it again.             What about just repeating -- see, what is worrying me is that the district court said precisely what the Fifth Circuit said, indeed stronger.       It says, "Despite the fact that petitioner's understanding of the reason was impaired by delusions," the Fifth Circuit concluded that that didn't matter.   Now, that means he is applying the same test in the district court that then the Fifth Circuit applied. What would you think about our just quoting the language from the Supreme Court opinions and say this is the language of the test.                We can't do better than that.   Go apply it.
06-666 +++$+++               Then of course you win as soon as we say the commodity is the same as milk. Obviously to me you would, but that's the issue.                  And in United Haulers what the question was, I thought, is if it is a traditional governmental function, anyway -- say, like producing electricity, or cleaning the streets -- there they discriminate and say you have to buy in State -- well, it's different, and indeed it may be okay. So what you've just heard your brother -- brother argue is if this is a fortiori, because here it's not even making electricity; it's not even collecting trash; it is financing the most basically governmental of all governmental institutions -- libraries, schools, streets. Now, why isn't it a fortiori from United Haulers, given the nature of the task that they are raising the money to finance?               You're arguing -- but can a State do this?    It produces a service or product; it sells the service or product to in-State people at a price 50 percent less than it sells to out-of-State people.               No, no, you're saying if the State owns cement, it can sell 50 percent less to its in-State citizens than out-of-State?              Fine.       Then could it do this?   Could it say that if you buy cement from out of State, the answer is no, right?              All right.       Suppose what they are selling is education?              Can the University of California say that when you send your child to the University of California, you will get a thousand dollars back on your income tax.               But if you send the child to an out-of-State school, you don't?              Well if that's fine, then what they say is we sell you participation in the financing of the project.              And if you buy -- we sell you the participation.       It's called a bond, and if in fact you give the money to us, and you are in-State, you get a thousand dollars back.            But if in fact, when you do the identical thing, and you buy a similar thing from out-of-State, you do not get the money back?                How is that different from what you just said was okay in respect to the University of California?             No, I'm sorry, then I wasn't clear in the hypothetical.                The hypothetical was that you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income tax.   So I was trying to make it exactly like this case. You pay a lower State tax.                 Well, you have a perfectly good remedy in respect to that.                If the States don't like this race to the bottom, they need only create a compact or go to Congress.                 You know, I was only -- I was only addressing your point that there was a practical problem.      Insofar as there is a practical problem, it seems to me the States have a perfectly good remedy even if they lose this case.                 Or win the case, whatever.                 However.                That argument cuts against you in context, I think.          You're saying in every case of any kind of discrimination one could go to Congress. Absolutely right. And since that's true of every case, now we are back to the more basic question, leaving the practicalities that you were talking about out of it, of whether this case is more like the cows.                   Is it more like the garbage collection?                Or is it on the far side of the garbage collection, even a stronger case for permission under the Commerce Clause?             That's where I wanted you to begin.
06-6911 +++$+++  
06-694 +++$+++               But none of those -- I mean, we've gone through this with the Solicitor General.   He went through every example in his brief that you've been able to produce, and he said they aren't caught by the statute.              What's wrong with what he said?   Why isn't that so?              Photographers, for example. That's not child pornography.              And if it was, they would have to act -- if it is child pornography under Ferber, it isn't protected.      If it isn't child pornography under Ferber, well, then there's no problem.                   Okay.   That's their view of the photographers.                 And the same with Amazon, the same with Netflix.              Problem with Ferber, you said.     Same problem.              So what's your response to what he said?     It is the -- with possession.                 You possess these materials.           What you are trying to do is take them to the police and stop them.                    Under Ferber, is that protected or not?         If it is protected, as I think it would be, so is it here.              Then under Ferber he's going to go right to jail because he has them.             I would think it would be protected.             I can't imagine somebody who collects, on these sites where they are molesting children, material to prevent children being molested and presents it to the proper authority is going to be prosecuted under the New York statute in Ferber.             Suppose we did this?     What would you think about an opinion, and why, which says the following?    We take every one of those examples and all the ones listed here and put them in appendix A, and the opinion says this is the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, as amended, say with the word presentment, which comes out of promotion infer, and we think under that interpretation of the statute, none of these things, nor anything like them, could be prosecuted. And if so understood, we can find no example, at least none not present in Ferber itself, where this would be overbroad.               Therefore, it is constitutional.    I'm not saying that is my view.              I am saying simply I want to know your opinion about what would be wrong with such an opinion.              It distracts from the question.   But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's interpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking the word "presentment" from its context in Ferber, where it was part of the definition of promotion, I thought that was the appendix.       At least, that's my hypothetical question.   And so whether you like appendices or don't like appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the appendix I'm talking about? He's filled it with qualifications using the words "knowingly, reasonable," and a context that if it is not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least commercial plus a few things such as bartering. That was really my question, and you've come back to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one thing I think his definition keeps out of this discussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I don't see under his interpretation how anyone could conceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a group who have never seen a movie.                  That isn't a reasonable group of people.             So what is your response to what he said?
06-713 +++$+++  
06-7517 +++$+++               Well, why is the 32(h) obligation relevant?       That is, looking through the history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the government has to allow the parties' attorneys to comment on the determination of the probation officer and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence. Then, in a case called Burns v. United States, this Court says that that right to comment includes a right to notice. And so all that 32(h) did was to take what was already the law and make specific that it includes a right to notice.   I take it that was what they were up to. But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C) together with the case of Burns. So I don't know where that leaves me, except thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has precisely the same right either way.                    And I guess it's easier just to say "departure" means generally all kinds of departures including not applying it. That's not a stretch of the language.                   It is quite right it is not consistent with what they thought they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you could say:   Well, they didn't think it would apply in Hawaii. So what?     I mean would you decrease that, General?
06-766 +++$+++                 Well, if you're not sure, it's difficult --              Why?      I mean I don't see how you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical? The reason I think you have to answer it is because the New York system is the system he described in the hypothetical, with a safety valve.              The safety valve being that the party leaders cannot just choose anybody.                I mean, if it looks they're going to choose something really nutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates and something will happen.              So they have leeway, but you can't go too far.              You don't like that. That's why I say you have to answer it.                If you feel that that's so terrible, then you say no, the Constitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain, wouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not better in the judgment of New York than a system where people raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run for office?
06-7949 +++$+++               This is exactly the kind of case, though, that I think would give tremendous discretion to the district judge.                  Because, as I just listened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features of it that are very case-specific, that require thorough knowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of judgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that sentencing judges are supposed to do. And that's what's worrying me about the test that the circuit court gives here.                   It lumps together things like what you just talked about with other things like:     I don't agree with the policy of the guideline, itself.    And this is a typical case and, therefore, I think we should look to try to find ways to unpack the sentence that it used, the statement -- you know, the worse it is, the worse the harder you look, et cetera, because that doesn't tell us much at all. It suggests a proportionate test, mathematical, which must be wrong.                   It must be wrong because the same degree of departure could result from a view of an abuse of a vulnerable victim as could result from a total misunderstanding of what robbery is about. Now, it's not the percentage there that matters.   It's the rationale.              It is what the judge did. And can you unpack it?         We just did in the last discussion try to unpack that, and we continue in the next case to try to do it. What we want -- I think what we want -- is to interpret that word "reasonable" so that we get back to a situation where judges do depart when they have something unusual and maybe occasionally when they think the guideline wasn't considered properly, and then the iterative process takes over, going back to the commission.    Now, how do we get there?              So, on that ground I understand perfectly, and were we to write that into a paragraph in the opinion, this case still, would it not, be the strongest case imaginable for discretion to the district judge?              You did, but I wanted to know what you were going to say.              Why isn't that always true? A judge should always give reasons commensurate with the problem.     So what if we added by saying remember give reasons commensurate with the problem?                      I see something we've lost.    What we've lost is we've sort of pulled across the screen here a rather murky curtain called "something of a presumption," which we can't quite define, which will lead to lawyers making endless arguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on one side of it or the other.              So let's sweep its aside. Let's get to the underlying facts.              That's correct.             We were making progress?      I thought our last discussion -- we were making progress on this very point, where we have the judgmental matters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy matters, and we distinguished the latter from the first two? If you were a district judge, wouldn't you find it more enlightening to talk in those terms?
06-8120 +++$+++               But I mean, the question -- so I want to know how to decide this case.                    I understand what your position is.       But I think the normal instinct of everybody is not about boats, taxis, airports and all these other examples, but this case.                    And I, I would say if you want to go on instinct I wouldn't think of getting out of a car when I'm the passenger and the policeman has stopped.       But maybe I'm wrong.               So when you asked a million policemen, how many instances did they tell you about where they stopped the car and all the passengers jumped out and walked away?                       Was there one?   Was there one.             Does it matter if they're on the Santa Monica Freeway?             I mean it would be pretty dangerous to get out.              How are we supposed to -- I think it's quite interesting.             How do you suggest we decide this/ I don't mean the result, but I'll go, I'll say yes, you've done your survey of the policemen, a million policemen think they're not restricting the movement of the passenger.          Very few passengers jump out of the car, but that may be because they're worried about being run over.      So you say, well, in fact they're restricted, but they don't think they're being restricted by the police, or do they?                   And here we have no idea, at least I have no idea.                I really don't know what the majority think and yet it would seem totally relevant.   How would we find out?                 So now perhaps I'm having so much difficulty, and maybe others are, because you've actually reached a question of law where facts matter. That is, the law points us to the direction of what would a person reasonably think in general in such circumstances, and we can look at five million cases, but we don't know.      So what do we do if we don't know? I can follow my instinct.            My instinct is he would feel he wasn't free because the red light's flashing.                  That's just one person's instinct.              Or I could say, let's look for some studies.     They could have asked people about this, and there are none.            Or I could say, well, you're the State of California, you're the ones able to get the studies; you could tell some of those professors, you know, to stop thinking about whatever they're thinking about and go ask a few practical questions, but you didn't. What should I do?                Hold that against you? Look for more studies?         Follow my instinct?                Well, that question hasn't been argued here.
06-8273 +++$+++               The question I have is, to go back, you said two separate things.                   One is you say the question here is a matter of Federal law.                   I'll give you that.    It's a matter of Federal law. But the question is, what's the content of the Federal law?    Does the Federal law say to the States -- State, in a collateral review proceeding, you want to apply Crawford retroactively to people whose convictions were long ago, do it, we don't care? And a lot of Teague says that should be the Federal rule, if it's called a Federal rule. But then you said a different thing, in answer to Justice Stevens.          The different thing was but the substantive rule of Crawford only takes effect as of the day of Crawford and into the future. Now, on that position, or take any other date you want as one year earlier or whatever you're going to pick there, if you're right about that, you win. But how could you be right about what I call there a metaphysical point?            Because on the metaphysics, as Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people who have three identical trials each one year before Crawford.   The first person is called Crawford, and he wins. The second person is called Smith, and he's delayed forever in the appeals process. And the third person is called Jones, and he get a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of Crawford. Now we know that the first two Crawford applies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford was the law at the time of the first two trials, why wasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in respect to the third person whose trial was held at precisely the same time?              I agree with that.              You've adopted Justice Scalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you whether -- whether -- whether there isn't just a simpler explanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza, Immanuel Kant, or even Aristotle.                 And the simpler explanation would be simply what Justice Stevens started with, that Teague is about remedies, and that we assume that the law was the law at the time of Crawford's trial, at the time of Smith's trial, and at the time of Jones' trial. But Jones is knocked out because he went to habeas.    And that's what Teague is about.               Habeas.   And, therefore, if the State wants to apply Crawford retroactively, let everybody out of jail, that's their problem.    Or their virtue.         That's up to them. That's where Justice Stevens started, and that's what I would like to hear an answer to.               Let me take the other point here, which is Justice Scalia's, which I think I understand now.    Imagine that the Crawford begins to take effect as of the day of decision.                   No law like Crawford before.   But for practical reasons and reasons having to do with courts, we let certain people take advantage of it.   We let person A take advantage of it, Mr. Crawford.   We let person B take advantage of it, who is on direct appeal.       We don't let people in habeas take advantage of it. Why don't we let the State take advantage of it in its collateral proceedings if the State wants to, for reasons of federalism, for reasons they can do what they want, for reasons if it is going to be the law in the future any way?
06-84 +++$+++                Well, how could that be?       I mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's clear the other way.        That is, if you look at the language, as you've just heard, if you look at the purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an instance where a person has continuous accidents.                  He's a reckless driver.      His insurance company puts him in just a category below the bottom and they read his credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he always pays his bills on time.                So they increase it, not to the top category, but they give him a much better deal.     And you're saying this statute means that what I just described is an adverse action based on a credit report?              Yes.      Okay.   And then if you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and then in light of the following:                 The little boy who says wolf.     You're probably puzzled what I mean by that.                   I mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there will be tens of millions of notices going out and they'll have the same effect on the public that these privacy notices have today.              We get them every day, dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, because they will become meaningless because to an average person that notice will not mean that he better look at his credit report.            It will mean throw it in the wastebasket. All right, now I've got the purpose, I've got the language, and I have what I think of as common sense.    Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.              It doesn't explain it because if you have an increase in the charge based on race, of course that's an increase based on race.              And if you refuse to give a person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based on race.   That is discrimination based on race.              That's true, and it's a discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate.                 You decreased it.              It's still a discrimination, it's still unlawful.              Let me look at the language.   Go back to give me -- because in ordinary English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, but maybe there is a technical term in the technical language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word increase means decrease.         And if you -- is there anything you want -- no.         It's a serious question, at least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses this word increase in the way you just suggested.              Which dictionary shall I look at?              By that you're talking linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose.                     So I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent of the people have the best credit score and that's about 1 percent.    So 99 percent of the public doesn't have the best possible credit score.                     Now I take it that means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps a little more when they look at that report that, since it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate which might be reserved for just perfect people.                     And if that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out notices.    And that's why I asked my question about the boy who calls wolf.      What will happen if 99 percent of the people who apply for insurance or any other thing get notices?    I suspect that this is only intuitive, that the notices are more likely to go into the wastebasket than they are if there was really a decrease.    Now, do you have any light you can shed on that?
06-856 +++$+++               Well, why?           Why?   That's the question, it seems to me, in the case.                       Why?    I mean -- imaginary example -- a plan, a thousand members.                           The trustee invests in a thousand diamonds.                       He puts it in a bank deposit vault.       One day he takes all 500 diamonds and runs off to Martinique.              We catch him enjoying the sun.     We can sue him under (2), right?                   That's what (2) is there for, right?        Right.        Okay.           Now, everything is the same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in individual safe deposit box with the participant's name on it.    Everything else is the same.                    Why should it matter?              Well, I'm sorry.            I'm not interested in that question.              I'm interested in my question.    Why isn't it available under (a)(2)?                       In both cases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to the plan and went to Martinique.                 Now, if you can sue him when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit box with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when they're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?             I want to go back to amend my example.    He only took one diamond.                  It was a big vault he took it from -- one diamond.                    You still have the claim, right?             It's a big vault.         He took it from one big safe deposit box -- one diamond.             No, this is just there in the big vault.             Well, of course.         Well-- no, no.   I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you seem to be turning this thing on how individualized this loss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of thousand. Now obviously I'm going to ask you, because I haven't yet heard the answer -- at least I didn't seem to hear it -- what the difference is whether that one diamond came from a big vault or from one little safe deposit box with the participant's label on it.              Exactly, the same kind of loss.     And what we have here is the footnote that was alleged in -- written in the opinion -- we assume the defendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary duties.     So therefore all of the discussion you have, that maybe it didn't -- well, maybe you're right.              But we better send it back so that they can decide that question.     And I just don't see what the other difference is.     It can't be a difference in the size of the diamond.     And people are saying, well, why -- well, you see the question.
06-9130 +++$+++               Do you actually have any information about the early 1940s, about who was a Federal law enforcement officer?               I think the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons -- there were a lot of people being detained.   There were goods that were having to do with contraband, foreign goods, maybe domestic, things you weren't supposed to have, food stamps.                  Illegal rations -- OPA -- I mean, you know, there were, you were only supposed to have so much food. Have we any notion who other law enforcement officers might have applied to at that time?              I think the FBI had quite a big job in World War II.              I thought there were thousands and thousands and thousands of FBI people.              So do we know?           I'm getting from you that you don't know and I don't know.                        Is that right?              We don't even have a ballpark.              Well, well that might be. But I'm sitting in Congress, I read this statute, I think maybe they were talking about customs people and the like.     Now, there is this other word in there, that's true.     So we look up, where does the other word come from?    The other word comes from Judge Holtzoff. He explained it, we don't have to guess.                  We can read his explanation.    His explanation comes in a paragraph having to do with customs and excise, and beginning with, I'm talking about customs and excise, and the additional proviso as special reference, where they use this phrase, and then he says it's all supposed to be like the Crown Proceedings Committee in England in 1927, which in fact had nothing to do with anybody but customs and excise.               So -- so if it was not -- I mean, I would suspect at that time Judge Holtzoff was a pretty well known person in the legal community and I would suspected if we are guessing at such a thing that quite a few did know who he was.               And I suspect that when Congress passes a technical bill, they are interested in the views of the Department of Justice and these were those views.               So if we are going to play a magic game that we don't pay attention to what sheds light on it, fine, then we don't, but I would.             But I think in reading that, I think that's a good point.                 My actual reading of it, of that paragraph 2, is that it's not free of ambiguity.   I completely agree with you.                And if I read through it, then I'm making up my mind as a judge, well, how do I feel about what these words likely show and how people in Congress would have interpreted that kind of reference or statement in testimony by a person who thought this?   Free of ambiguity, I agree with you, it isn't.   But it might cut somewhat more in favor of the Petitioners than the Respondents.              Have you -- have you found any -- any research on that?           I mean I think that's a very interesting point that -- that -- have you found any book I could look at or           report that -- that would cast some light on whether at that time, 1946, the phrase "other law enforcement officers" referred to a large number of people who had a lot of different tasks that had not much to do with customs or excise? If so, this would be an odd way of sneaking them into the bill.     That's who it would look like. On the other hand, if there were just a few of them, well, then, the bill, at worst, is a little bit more than somebody might have thought; and it would appear perfectly normal to a legislator.               So is -- is there anything to look at?
06-923 +++$+++               But I don't know what to look to in trust law.       I mean, all that's happened here, every life insurance -- every company, every life insurance company has the kind of conflict that you're talking about.    Every company has the kind of conflict you're talking about.       And an automobile company might make shoddy merchandise so it can make more money in the short run. How does trust law keep that kind of conflict?    Now, it can't be and it isn't, because I've looked it up, I think, that trust law says that every distribution by a trustee whose own fee depends on the size of the trust is conflicted.  trustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here -- -              The -- the -- so what do I look to?   And where I ended up was I'd like an answer to what I asked the other side.             I ended up, I can't do better than Firestone, I ought to write two words in this opinion, and the standard, perfect; from the opinion below, perfect.        You want to know what I mean, read the opinion below.        Okay? Now, what's your view on all of that?              I overstated.              Take the examples that I gave.    It's an ordinary insurance policy.              But that's, you see, their point.    Their point is this is just an ordinary insurance company, an ordinary policy, and it's really like a bank that's a trustee that in fact takes money that hasn't been distributed and puts it on its own account.    They make money for that, from that.               So there is a conflict.              You have that kind of conflict. What do you say about that?                The bank makes its money by putting money in an account, paying interest and lending it at more money.                Yes, and Chase Manhattan bank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they just put in for three days money into an interest-bearing account and lend it out for five minutes, they will make $1 billion.                      Okay.   You see, they are finding these kinds of conflicts everywhere. And that's what I'm asking you. What I think if I were to add something I'd say, look at this carefully, judge, look at it carefully; but if all you find is an ordinary insurance company doing ordinary work and there is no ground for suspicion, proceed to step two.               What about that?                 Well, is there an example in trust law where, say, a bank's a trustee and they self-insure in some area?            Is there ever a case in trust law that found that to be a conflict.                 Well, I mean, you can easily transpose this to other -- trusts are run by banks often that are trustees.                They're huge, and they might self-insure in simple -- in certain circumstances, in which case you reproduce something like the conflict that's at issue here.        And so --                 And I think that -- my guess, but I don't know.           That's why I'm so nervous.         Is there any example where that kind of thing has ever been held to be a conflict of interest?               Then what analogy?         I agree with your basic point.         If I encapsulate it, you may or may not agree with my encapsulation.                      This reminds me a lot of the argument between Learned Hand and Felix Frankfurter under what "substantial evidence" meant. And like Learned Hand, your side, I think, or the first argument, wants to find an absolute standard, a perfect analogy, which Frankfurter said you can't do.                     Very well. What's worrying me is what is the analogy? Because you're not saying it's just conflict-of-interest law.    You are analogizing it to a trustee who himself is a remainderman.    And it's at that point that I begin to get off this boat because I'm not sure that's the right analogy. Now, you've looked through lots of cases. Your colleague knows it better than you, and he hasn't come up with something that's a better analogy.                  But do you see what's bothering me?              So, therefore I'm back where I started:    Two-sentence, two-word opinion.                We did our best in Firestone and this decision below is a good illustration of how to do it.                   What can you add to what I just said?
06-937 +++$+++               Well, there's a reason, I guess, that would be so.           Imagine that I want to buy some bicycle pedals, so I go to the bicycle shop.                         These are fabulous pedals.        The inventor has licensed somebody to make them, and he sold them to the shop, make and sell them.     He sold them to the shop.                   I go buy the pedals.     I put it in my bicycle.              I start pedaling down the road. Now, we don't want 19 patent inspectors chasing me or all of the other companies and there are many doctrines in the law designed to stop that.                      One is the equitable servitudes on chattel.                      Another is the exhaustion of a patent.          And now you talk about implied license. I would say, why does it make that much difference?     What we're talking about here is whether after those pedals are sold to me under an agreement that the patent -- you know, you have a right to sell them to me -- why can't I look at this as saying that patent is exhausted, the patent on the pedals and the patent for those bicycles insofar as that patent for the bicycles says I have a patent on inserting the pedal into a bicycle. Call it exhaustion, call it implied license. Who cares?              Ah, but I thought --              Yes.      Of course, I think the answer to that is no, probably no, but, but, but, but.    Now you can clarify this because I may be off on a wrong track.    I thought we're talking about using the sold item in those mechanisms which account for virtually almost the only logical use of the sold item. Thus, if you took the bicycle blanks -- not the bicycle blanks; they are eyeglass blanks.                 I'm mixed up between bicycles and eyeglasses, there we are. But if you took the eyeglass blanks and you use them for the purpose of growing plants instead of inserting them into eyeglasses, I guess we'd have had a different case.             And I take it here they are using those chips in those mechanisms that the chips are almost exclusively designed for and there isn't much else to use them for.       Am I right or wrong?                 All right, now if it should be protected -- and here I'm not sure I'm understanding it, so correct me.      Let's suppose we have this contract. So everything is identical except we've got my bicycle example in here because I'm more comfortable with that. I know how to ride a bicycle and I don't know how to work the chips.     So what I do --              But you see the analogy I'm making.              So what I do I go to the shop and I buy this, this mechanism with the pedals on it, and then I insert it in my bicycle.                     Now, actually I need help in doing that, but I do it.                     Okay.   Now I start pedaling off, and now what is it for all these things here that would stop that original inventor from catching me and hauling me into court, and say, what you've done, Breyer, is you've put my -- my mechanism here in this bicycle and I happen to have a patent on the system.    And now you start talking to me about, well, the patent was exhausted on the bicycle --              -- pedals, but not on the system.              And you agree that shouldn't happen.              But if I follow you and I write an opinion just for you, what stops it from happening?             Then why isn't it in your case?             Why doesn't it mean that? Why isn't it in your case equally?             You mean that they just got it all wrong?   You mean it should be that they got it wrong?             Oh, so if I go in the bicycle shop, I go in the bicycle shop and I buy the pedals and then they give me, you know, one of these pieces of paper that has all of the 42,000 words on it and there in these 42,000 words it says, and now you are put on notice that once you put it in your bicycle and you pedal away, they're going to get you and you're going to be hauled into Patent Court, then -- then that's okay?             Then explain -- now this you might know because it's just following up on what Justice Souter said better than I did.                 I think from these briefs I've gotten the impression that at least some people think that where you invent a component, say, like the bicycle pedals, and it really has only one use, which is to go into a bicycle, it's the easiest thing in the world to get a patent not just on that component but to also get a patent on the system, which is called handlebars, body, and pedals. And since that's just a drafting question, all that we would do by finding in your favor is to destroy the exhaustion doctrine, because all that would happen, if it hasn't happened already, is these brilliant patent lawyers, and they don't even -- they can be great patent lawyers, not just fine lawyers, and just draft it the way I said and that's the end of the exhaustion doctrine.     And that's why it is preferable to say it is exhausted.     What is exhausted?             One, the patent on this component and, two, the patent on any system involving this component where that system is the only reasonable use of the component, rather than using the terminology "implied license." Now, I think that's an argument that's being made in some of these briefs, and if so I'd like to you reply.
06-939 +++$+++              So you did on that point on page 27 and 25 and 29 of the AFL-CIO brief, I took the statements there, where it would say "organizations," namely organizations, even those that receive a hundred percent of their money from the State are free to use their profits?              If there are any, or any other non-state moneys they had?              So if you sell them tables and they write you a check, the State, for the tables, at that point the check is yours?              All right.             What is your recommendation as to -- we've heard today, too, in the briefs it's there, I put the thing that I've heard as -- well, the example with the tables is an example of it.                    When does the profit actually accrue?             Is there treble damage provision that makes this much worse?                    Are there administrative requirements that in practice make it impossible?    Is it administered in such a way that the employee we heard about would just not know what to say, the employer's representative? All those things could be problems, and you say, well, they haven't been dealt with yet.                   And your recommendation as to what we should do is what?             And if we did that, how would all these problems be worked out?                   I mean, how would the arguments that you -- they think are far too burdensome, you think they are not and can be done properly, how does that get worked out?
06-969 +++$+++                How could you tell?   I rather liked the one --               I rather liked the one we had before about Senator Faircloth, and his ad was, Senator Faircloth is against the trial lawyers and their efforts to increase liability laws, so write him.                Now, testimony all over the place.             That is the advocacy candidate ad of the century.            And you couldn't possibly know that without having known that one of the parties had spent millions trying to paint Faircloth's opponent, Senator Edwards, as the creature of the trial lawyers, that anyone -- that anyone in North Carolina knew it. So they read those words and they understand precisely what's at stake.   They're saying vote against Edwards, vote for Faircloth.     You just tell me how anyone could know such a thing without looking at the context.              I thought people offered to bring in such facts as -- there was a web site address here.   It says, indeed oddly, don't phone the Senator. Go look at the web site.         And if you look at that web site, it says defeat him, defeat him, defeat him.                 I mean, that sounds as if they have defeat in mind. So certainly, there are about four or five things which they said to look at outside the four corners.   So I'm not certain what it is in the law that says that you only look to the four corners.                 I mean, I read the opinion below.        Did you read it, by the way, the 1,000-page opinion?        I bet you did, the 1,000-page opinion of the district court?              Good.       Then you know like I know, and it took me a week, and it probably took you less, but you know what that record was like in the case, don't you?              Thousands and thousands of pages that as I read it, I drew one conclusion.                 The one conclusion was if there's a law, and it's a good law under the Constitution, if it is, that corporations and labor unions cannot give money to political campaigns. And if it is true, as it is true, that what political campaigns are about now is television.                    And if it is true, as it is true, that these are the single lion's share, the single best way to get somebody defeated or elected, then if you open the gates and say corporations and rich givers or whatever can contribute by writing these ads and paying for them, forget the first two premises.     Forget the rule that says corporations can't contribute. Now, I put all that in front of you.                 It seems to me what you're asking for is for us to overturn MCConnell and to say either in practice or in theory, MCCain-Feingold campaign finance law is unconstitutional.              And you are asking for nothing else.             I agree with you it's exactly as Justice Scalia said.               If we agree with you in this case, good-bye MCCain-Feingold.                     Maybe we should do it up front.    That's what you advocate.                   Very well. Would you address that?         Why should this Court only a year or two after it upholds MCCain-Feingold, accept a position that either in fact or in theory overturns that case?              But that's, that's the point, because where I get into my chain.               You have an argument.   I'm not denying that.              I understand it.   But it's sort for me deja vu all over again.                We've heard it.              And what happened before -- either you can distinguish this, which I don't see how frankly, or you're back into the chain, and if you want to say one more thing about the chain, I didn't draw it to the final ending there, if I take most of the ads -- and that's what that Kollar-Kotelly opinion is about. That's what that 1,000-page record is about.                That's what the 10,000 pages of testimony were about.                That's what MCCain-Feingold was about, and all those witnesses. They said in today's world these are the kinds of ads people run just to defeat people.                And then they said, moreover, most of the campaign money goes on them.                   And then they said, moreover, if you let corporations and labor unions contribute to these, well, then they can contribute to the campaign.            And the only thing I left out before was, if you're prepared to say the Constitution the Constitution requires us to let corporations and unions buy these kinds of ads, well, how could it be constitutional to have a statute that forbids them to contribute directly to the candidate, something that's been in existence only since I guess 1904?   But how could that be constitutional if they can just give this money directly?               Why can't they give this same money to the candidate?                Is that right?         I mean, 1,000 is what we have here, is we happen to have three criteria, absolutely clear:             Does it mix the candidate? Does it run within 30 or 60 days before the election? And is it targeted to an electorate?                     Now, that's clear. Now, if you're prepared to say that's unclear, I don't understand it, you don't need a 1,000-page record about that.              All you need is a record where you have your organization to come in and show how yours is significant different from the mine run of cases.    What's the problem?               Oh, yes.         Yes, I see you could distinguish.               In fact this isn't the First Amendment totally on one side.                      Isn't this, isn't this a case where the courts held that there are very significant constitutional interests on both sides of the equation, which is what makes this kind of thing difficult.     Isn't that so?               I'm just suggesting why a pure First Amendment test doesn't necessarily answer the question and why we've upheld MCCain-Feingold.              The theory is that the ad itself on the web site, in your opinion, would have been okay?    You turn to the web site three months before the election.    It says 16 times out of 16 in the past two years, Feingold and Kohl have voted to filibuster certain of the President's nominees.                     Feingold and Kohl are putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock and costing taxpayers money.                     Now three months before the election you put -- write that in your ad. Now, is that in your opinion constitutionally protected, gets it out of MCCain-Feingold?              Yes.      What you did, suppose instead of what you ran, you know, in a broadcast ad.              You think that is protected?
06-984 +++$+++               -- shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. Now, as I understand it, the United States entered into a treaty.        That treaty said we will follow the interpretations and the judgments of the International Court of Justice in respect to the Vienna Convention. And that Court did make a judgment in that respect, in respect to this client, and it said:                Our judgment is that Texas, or someone in the United States, must redo the procedural hearing simply to see whether, in deciding whether there's prejudice or whether there's a procedural default, full account is taken of the importance of the Vienna rights.                That's what we're talking about. It's a judgment of the court.              The United States has promised to follow that judgment of the court.   The Constitution says, since it promised by treaty, that is the law; and the law binds the States. That may be simple-minded, but I'd like to hear what the answer to that, rather, chain of logic is -- chain of law.              I was not talking --              -- about the President's memorandum at the moment.           And to be -- to disclose fully what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that maybe if a president disagreed in such a thing, some kind of a question -- I'm not sure what -- would be presented. But whatever "what," I don't worry about that "what" here, because the President, too, agrees.              No, forget whether we recognize it this way as a judgment.                     I'm saying we promised in the treaty to follow that thing.                     Call it whatever name you want.         We promised to follow that thing, which I have in front of me -- excerpts of which -- called an Avena something.              And we know what that says.    I'm just looking to see what they call it.                      They call it -- well, you tell me what they call it.                     They call it -- it is not called the word "judgment."                         It's called: "The appropriate reparation in this case consists of the obligation of the United States to" -- and then they listed it. So I take it we have promised to carry out that obligation by treaty.               What are the words that the Senate said?   Because, when you say "self-executing," the easiest way for me to understand that is the Constitution means what it says. But there happened to be a few instances where the nature of the obligation or the intent of the party makes it very difficult to enforce it as a binding judgment of a court.      That is not this case.               Oh, and so if they did that, now, will you quote the words or give me the reference where the Senate said:               Although we entered into this and although we ratify it, we're not going to do it --               -- unless you --                Fine.       Then, are you saying there are -- there are 112, I believe, treaties in which we've entered into promises that we're going to follow what an international tribunal said.                  Somebody looked up, I saw on the Internet, that at this moment there are approximately 116 regulatory entities in the world where we've entered, or others have entered into, regimes, where there are various adjudicatory tribunals of different kinds, mostly commercial, that bind us. And is your view:               All of these thousands, perhaps, or hundreds, anyway, of treaties are unlawful, and that our promises are not enforceable, because there's a constitutional question?                No.     No.      I'm thinking that are self- executing.       I'm thinking that there are -- like WTO, NAFTA.    We can go down a long list of instances where the United States has promised to follow the decisions of tribunals that are not Article III courts and to put them into effect at once.                And I wonder, without further ado, now, are you saying that all those are unconstitutional?                "Yes" or "no"?        I'd appreciate a "yes" or "no" answer.                Okay.             I'm sorry.       What I don't understand about this is that I thought that the ICJ in this case interpreted the treaty.                That's not Federal law.   That's the treaty.        And it said that the treaty --             Oh, then I don't understand you because the WTO interprets a treaty.                 It interprets a treaty that binds the United States, just like the ICJ is interpreting a treaty that binds the United States. So what's the difference?               Maybe these other nations have an inquisitorial system where an investigating judge collects a dossier and the fact is noted in the dossier and the investigating judge and the prosecution give it such weight as it's entitled to.               You know that doesn't happen?              In an --              Of course it matters.   But the -- of course it matters.            That's why when I read the -- the ICJ opinion, I read it as saying that they're not telling you to set aside a procedural default rule. What they've asked you to do is to provide, by means of the United States' own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences by taking account of the violation of rights. And throughout they ask -- when you decided whether the person was really prejudiced, when you decided whether there had been forfeiture of the rights, at that time, did you ask yourself that the reason he might not have raised them was because he knew nothing about them and his lawyer knew nothing about them, because nobody ever told either about them?             In which case there might be a causal connection. As I read it, the ICJ left all that up to you but just asked you, please, look at it again having read our opinion and keeping this in mind.              And how does the WTO differ?              How does the WTO and NAFTA and all our trade agreements differ?              If you assume it is self-executing, just for one second, I'd like to find out -- you said that the President was unreasonable in a sense of saying Texas do that over again -- I assume the reason he asked Texas to have the hearing is because the ICJ knew -- and I guess maybe he knew -- that the only hearing they'd had on this subject -- as far as I can see; I looked at it, there didn't seem to be any evidence in respect to their finding that there was no prejudice.                   They said well, he had a lawyer, but that lawyer later got into quite a lot of trouble, I think.              He had two lawyers.          One got into trouble, and the other didn't?                 Okay, they vigorously defended him.                 Fine.       Fine.     My point is there's no evidence of that.                 There is?          In the first habeas hearing?                 I read the whole thing.                 What I'm thinking of is the evidence at the first habeas hearing that led the district judge to reach his conclusion that there was no prejudice and that the procedural default was not excused -- it's in that hearing that I didn't see what that finding was based on; and I suppose the reason that the President wanted Texas to do it is it would be easiest for Texas to go back to that.              It was in the first hearing.              So you think there was no reason for the ICJ to ask the President --                And what did happen to the lawyers Texas gave him?
06-989 +++$+++                  That's why just what you said is actually what's worrying me about the case. Because what Justice Ginsburg said makes me think that there could be situations, a lot of situations, where Federal judges do want to peel the case off.                     And you say send it to a master.           Maybe some would lend themselves to a master; maybe some wouldn't.                     I have no idea. And are we going to have to hold in this case whether a judge or when a judge, a Federal judge, does or does not have authority to do such a thing? That's why I say -- I was actually thinking the case of the century, because it's going to take a hundred years to finish. But the fact is there are those issues there once we say Section 9 doesn't apply.                     Then you're going to have to say -- suppose we were to say it's just State law.    Well, suppose the State doesn't allow enforcement of this kind of contract?           Then we have the question of the authority -- of the inherent authority, not statutory, of a Federal district judge to peel off bits of cases and decide them in different ways. I don't know the answer to those questions, but I think they are quite important.                    So what do I do?                Oh, no, because there is a holding in the whole Ninth Circuit, which accounts for a large percent of the country, that the district judge can't do this.    And that's quite a significant holding in that circuit, and we ought to review that.             Oh, if there is, then let's think -- suppose that in the middle of a trial, the parties say, judge, this is so complicated factually, we have a way that we can get an agreed statement of facts. They walk out the door; they have a friend who has a sign called arbitrator; and they come away from that friend with an agreed statement of facts, which they agree to submit to the judge to apply the law.                   Now, there is nothing wrong with that, I imagine.              We know -- I'm sorry.            I'm not even going to tell the judge how I find this.                   I go to a crystal ball; I go to any way I want.                   I will come in with an agreed statement of facts, and is there anything, if we have that agreed statement of facts, that would will stop the judge from saying I take this agreed statement of facts; there's a difference about how the law applies to it; I will resolve this case?              Well, no -- I just say -- well, I'll ask you the next question.                   I take the answer to the first question is there's nothing wrong with that.             I'm sorry.          I thought that, if in fact parties come in with an agreed statement of fact in a case, I've never seen a situation where the judge couldn't say, fine, I agree; that's the -- the judge would say I'm sorry, even though you agree, I insist that you go to trial and?             He can?             All right, so there are public policy limitations.             Well, is there anything wrong here?    My question basically, obviously, is, is there anything wrong in this case if they had come in with an agreed statement of fact?               All right.       I'm trying to get to my question; I'm not asking it very well. What they agreed to is an agreed statement of facts, subject to Section 9 standards, Section 9 and 10.               What I'm driving at, whether I've asked it well or not --               -- is is how is it any different from coming in with an agreed statement of facts?             Has that been a nightmare -- has it been the nightmare you suggest in labor arbitration?    Because I think labor arbitration falls outside the act, doesn't it?             And has that turned into some kind of terrible nightmare where there are dozens of rules and they have a long complicated labor set of regulations on it?      I don't think so, but has it?              Well, if we run that pretty well, why wouldn't you run this pretty well --              -- given a back-up, looking at it as a default?
07-1015 +++$+++               Well, why -- why isn't the protection -- I have the number of the rule I want. Maybe I am not understanding it.                 But Rule 26(e)(2), says -- says, among other things, that the judge can change the number of depositions you get.                 He could reduce them to zero if, for example, he decides the burden or the expense outweighs the likely benefit. Can't he do that whether you are the president of Coca- Cola or whether you are the president of Ford or whether you are the President, or you are the Attorney General?                Can he do that or not?                Yes, he can.             No, but they didn't -- that isn't what 96 says.     What 96 says, which I think is important, is it says that they knew of and agreed to subject the plaintiffs to these harsh conditions solely on account of their religion, race, and national origin, and for no legitimate penological interest.                  Because, if they are looking for suspects from 9/11, given the people they found, it's not surprising that they might look for people who looked like Arabs.                  All right?   That isn't surprising to me, because that was what the suspects looked like. So, they want to say, yes, that was part of it, but it's not for no legitimate penological interest; it was for every good reason:             We didn't want more bombs to go off. Now, suppose that's their view.                 Suppose also -- I'm just hypothetically -- they never, and they know this, ever had a conversation where they said, go look for people of Arabic descent alone.                  They never said that.   They said, look for those people who have other connections and had something we reasonably believe is 9/11-connected; they might be dangerous. Suppose that's what they thought.               So they read this, and they think, Judge, I want to tell Judge that you have no evidence to show anything other than what I just said, which sounds as if it might be reasonably connected to the 9/11 investigation.                   What is open to our two defendants, if you win this case?                   If they're right, how do they prevent lots of depositions from coming in and taking their time?              How do they prevent this case dragging on and taking their time?                  If the facts are what I just said, rather than what you think?             They'll -- they'll deny the facts; then you'll say there's a factual matter.                  And suppose hypothetically -- not what you think -- but you have no reason at all hypothetically, imagine, for believing that they did this solely for racial reasons unrelated to the investigation of 9/11.                     Suppose you don't have any information that shows that, and they are going to say everything else is covered by qualified immunity, and you have nothing else.                      Then what do they do to get out of 10 years of discovery?
07-10374 +++$+++                But what is the neutral reason related to the administration of courts that leads the State to close its door to a damage suit under 1983 against correctional officers?               -- taking as the assumption exactly what Justice Ginsburg said.                     I mean, I can't find any reason that's neutral and administrative other than what Justice Ginsburg said, which is neither: namely New York does not like 1983 actions for damages against correctional officers.              What other reason is there?               But Testa v Katt was a case in which the Court found that the State allows some State action that are analogous to the Federal action and you can't discriminate against a Federal action.              This is not that case. This is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't allow -- damage actions like the Federal action --              -- and this Court has not decided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in such a situation.    So I would think that the way we would apply it is take the standard and ask the State, what is the neutral administrative-related reason? Because what they are saying is, if you look at this, from an administrative point of view, it's that red-haired, one-eyed man with a limp.              So what you have now is you have one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong; I think, I assume that.     But if the State closed their doors to this kind of suit because they say we think our correctional officers should be immune from damages, now we know they can get money under the Federal law, but we want nothing to do with this.              That, I think, would be discrimination against the suit if that were their reason. Now, there is a neutral reason, and it's demonstrated, and it is, well, you see, there are just too many -- there are just too many lawsuits by prisoners against prison officials.                      And we don't want all that business in that court, and here's how we deal with it. One, we take away their cause of action, that's what we do under State law, and then we -- the feds -- we throw them back to Fed court?                      Without --                You don't offer them a court of claims, because what you offer in the court of claims is an action against the State.                     And you can say that isn't a big deal because after all, most of these really are actions against the State anyway, because they get compensated. Okay, so if I treat that as neutral, I have one bad reason and one good reason.                      And how do I know which is which?    That is, is it really true that there are a lot of suits brought in State courts in places with prisons under 1983 for damages rather than Federal courts?   I don't know what the numbers are?                 Have you looked them up at all?              -- 1983 actions, but maybe they bring them mostly in Federal court.              Okay.       So one way to test this out would be the following:               If we had numbers and knew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage actions against prisoners were being brought in State courts in districts that have prisons there, and then we saw how much New York was really hurting and then we asked another question, maybe there is some Federal security actions, you see, where there is no State comparable action and we found out, well, the State lets them bring these actions in State court.                  So, there are ways of dealing with this empirically.                  Have you any sense of it?
07-10441 +++$+++                 What is the -- what if the other reasons apply?        I take it the words "self-incriminating statement" in (e) means any adverse evidence?                Okay.       Now, there are a lot of reasons we exclude evidence.                You know, I mean -- it might, for example, might not in the circumstance be worth the confusion.        It might not in the circumstance be worth the time.      It might violate -- I don't know, there is like a whole -- there are many reasons. So in your opinion, does section (a) mean to set aside all the reasons?            In other words, if for some other reason this particular piece of self-incriminating evidence, adverse evidence obtained after 30 hours, violated the admission, violated some totally different rule of evidence, as your opinion does (a) mean, judge, it doesn't matter if it's triple hearsay or it doesn't matter if it violates some authentication requirement, it doesn't matter if it violates, you know, it has to be relevant, pertinent, not a waste of time -- it doesn't matter; admit it?              No, of course it doesn't mean that.              So if it doesn't mean that, then why does it mean that we should ignore this other rule of evidence contained in Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?              Well, there are -- there are, in other words, as you have heard, a number of things that can happen when you hold a person, let's say for 40 hours for 29.      I mean, one thing that happens is he doesn't learn how he gets out on bail.                  Another thing he happens, he doesn't learn exactly what the charge is against him.   Another thing -- they are all listed in, in Rule 5. And -- and when you have an exclusionary rule, you enforce not only what you are talking about, which I understand, which is the voluntariness part, but you also enforce all these other things that happen when you bring a person before a magistrate and don't keep him for 70 hours or something. So why should we interpret (a) as setting those other things aside and requiring us to overturn MCNabb and Mallory?             No, of course not.             Did it say anything in the legislative history, which interests me, that the purpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and MCNabb?                 I wasn't focusing on the word "confession."      I was focusing on the words in (e), which were "any self-incriminating statement."              And that's why I asked you if you interpreted that to include anything that the individual said after, say, 29 hours that might turn out to be adverse to that defendant's interests.         And your answer to that was yes.                 And I think you are right. I think we agree on that. So, if the defendant said, if you look under the rock you will find the writing such-and-such, it might not be authenticated for that particular writing. There are many reasons.          It might be triple hearsay, what he says.   I mean, you know, there are a variety of things, aren't there?        Maybe I am wrong.                 The reason I brought that up is not to be technical.            The reason I brought it up is to point out that there are many, many words that a person could utter in confinement under 30 hours, which in a variety of ways could stab him in the back without it having anything to do with Miranda, without it having anything to do with coerced confession. And similarly, there are many reasons for bringing him forward that have nothing to do with either.    And therefore, I wonder if all those reasons could support retaining MCNabb-Mallory, a matter about which Congress said nothing.
07-1059 +++$+++               That is pretty important. Tell me -- this is a hard area, obviously.                  But the -- imagine -- think of all the toller cases that they've had. Now -- now, is this right:                  That in every one of those cases there were two companies, A and B; and in every one of those cases A sells a finished product into the United States.              And also A sends the product to B to have some major thing done on it.                 In every one of those cases the Commerce Department could say:   We can take A as a Respondent; i.e. we think A might violate the law, because maybe it's an Italian company, or we think B might violate the law.                 Is that true of all those cases?              All right.       Now, if it's true of all those cases, then I think what the opposite position is, what Mr. Farr said, I think -- I think, you know, I will -- he will say:            Look at page 40 and 41 of their brief.   When I look at those pages, I am going to see a lot of cases.     And I bet, when I look them up, those Commerce cases are all going to use the word "substantial transformation."             And he will say:   You see, that's what they did here. Then he's going to add -- I don't mean to put words in his mouth if the words are wrong, but -- but he's going to add:       Look at those tolling cases. Those are all cases where Commerce had a choice of which to consider the sale.      It could have considered the sale from the processor A to -- to B to A, the sale if it wanted to; or it could have considered the sale into the United States if it had wanted to, to be the sale for purposes of calculating the price. And so in choosing between those two, either of which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale, the final sale, because that's how they could calculate the price. But in your case there is no such person A, because the utilities are not people who could be respondents.   I mean they are not in the same position. There is no sale onwards that they could choose.              So we will go to the other guy, the party -- the person who does the processing.      Are you following what I am saying?             And what is the answer to that?             Yes.      But, remember, they are saying in the tolling cases, in my words:                 Hey, we could have gone after the processor if we wanted --             -- if there had been a substantial transformation, because the key to this concept of "sale" is the word "substantial" transformation.             In which --              Is there any point in time from the time that the -- the processors get ahold of the uranium until the time it leaves their control that if they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility could get ahold of the product?                No.     Okay.
07-1090 +++$+++                 Can you -- I would like to follow up on Justice Stevens's question.                 Think of three categories, A is the category which you could see that other questions of law apply to.                 B, is this case, and C, is the other -- other things -- other things that it might apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd to apply them to that.         All right, what's in category C?              Wait, wait.          After Saddam Hussein falls --              -- and we have a new government --              Yo mean some period of days, or something?              All right, is there any one other than that?              No.     Okay.              So basically, basically your reading --              -- is the word "any other" does apply to any other.              Except your case.              And possibly this thing for a couple of days.              Well, that isn't exactly an absurd result then, to say "any other" really means any other including this case.
07-1114 +++$+++               Blankman, that isn't the concern.     The concern is simply this:                   If they're correct, that this whole trial revolves around whether this individual is suffering post traumatic stress disorder with these amphetamines. They have two expert witnesses who say that he's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted them to say; that's it.          That's their evidence. On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the defendant told them about his drug use.                      At which point the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on drugs?   No. Let's talk to Mr. Flynn.                   When you processed him, did he look like he was on drugs?                     No.   And then let's talk to Ms. Blankman, okay? So, now the case is submitted, and at that point the prosecutor says, there is no evidence that he was on drugs.     He said that.           Two, those two expert witnesses, and it's baloney.              There's your case. Now, in fact in the files is evidence that Mr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day, sent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous drug user.     There is evidence in the files that Mr. -- that the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins. There are three witnesses who have described the behavior of the day as frenzied, and we have heard the descriptions. And you're saying that the lawyer, the trained lawyer for the government, who knew this information and knew the defense just what?                 Just overlooked it by accident?          Just what?              You also had cross-examined the two expert witnesses in order to show that they didn't really know that this man was a drug user, because their only basis for that was he told them.                      So as I've read these briefs, I've come away concluding yours with a strong impression that this was a relevant issue.    That the prosecution did not concede that he was on drugs at the time of the murder.                      Indeed, that that was all that was at issue. And so I just don't see, like Justice Souter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be useful information if -- even for cross-examination, and I think more than that since you have three direct witnesses. But leaving that aside, there's another part of this case that equally bothers me.                     It seems to me there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told the courts that this matter had never been raised.                        Is that so?     Or maybe he said that the courts had decided it because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent positions, first saying that the trial courts decided it, and they did decide it, but by accident.                     They thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it referred to an earlier claim. So first they tell the courts -- and you wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar because there were a lot of words written.                     They tell the courts:    It's been decided, judge.                   Don't worry. They decided it:     Adequate State ground.                  And next they wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then they announce:     Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for not knowing of it in the first place.                     And he didn't know of it until 1993. So I see the State taking opposite positions, and -- and what seems from the briefs inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused.                    What is it that happened in this case?              Well, "waiver," my goodness.   First, I don't think it's impossible to say "waiver" since he wrote the words in paragraph 41 that make absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it.                    He is raising it. Then, aside from that, the paragraph of the district -- of the court of appeals's opinion says they were already decided or waived.              So it's ambiguous, at best, for you. So let's go back and see what the State district court held, and I think that the State district court held that it had been decided, not that it had been waived.   Am I right?               Yes.               Okay.       So there the cases in this Court would say if a State appeals court writes a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so you don't know whether it was decided:                  For example, they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided, then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is look to the lower court to see what they actually did. So we follow that rule, and we get to exactly what justice Alito said:               That what they did was they were holding that this has already been decided.               Don't you think at this point the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs: I've been getting the runaround.               First, they tell me it's one thing; then they tell me another.                  All I can tell you is this:     No one has ever passed on the merits of this Brady claim, which is a substantial claim.               So you choose the procedures, but be sure that that's the outcome.              Could the explanation of this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the State first argued that it had already been decided; then in later courts the State changed its theory and announced that it had been waived?              Isn't that why they're writing about waiver?
07-11191 +++$+++         Well, I think that underlying this is a fairly simple problem, conceptually.     Imagine we have Sir Walter Raleigh at trial, and there s an affidavit for missing witness A and witness B and witness C, and they are over in a room somewhere, whether they were treated badly or not, and they have written these pieces of paper.                  In they come. And Walter Raleigh says:              "Bring me the witness."     Now, suppose they had trotted him out, and he cross-examined him.       Still, those pieces of paper came in, and they weren't cross-examined.                 And so what do we do about that?    They weren't cross-examined, and how did they get in here?        As I read this statute, it does let in that piece of paper.        And so why then, by analogy, isn't the statute bad?        If -- unless you -- unless you have some special kind -- I mean, you d have to some special -- specially reliable evidence that sort of fell within the Confrontation Clause but not totally.    And that's what I -- the more I think about that, the harder that one is to do.          Well, to put my chips on the table, which you probably understand, I thought the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion.          So, therefore, what do I do? (Laughter.)        All right.       So the statement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your opinion, would have the effect of limiting Melendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that statement?        What if it doesn't quite work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be expanding, just with the opportunity for cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions into areas where it s not necessary for fairness purposes? Then does it make sense to say -- hey, unfortunately, to say that the only workable system is that you have a system which has exactly the confrontation point, but indicia of reliability do have an impact as to what the implications of the Confrontation Clause violation are, in terms of practical trial necessity.        Now, there we are, accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford. (Laughter.)        Well, what about Raleigh's witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you, for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter, and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say, oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine them later in the trial.
07-1122 +++$+++               What are the facts that show that a reasonable person in the passenger's position would have believed himself free to terminate the encounter?              What are the facts that show that the person who was searched, which is Mr. Johnson -- is that right?              Well, what are the facts that suggest that he thought he was free to terminate that encounter with the police?              All right.       I would say we've held a lot that that's just beside the point.                     If you stop a car for a traffic stop, you can search it for all kinds of things.        You can do all kinds of things not related.     So if that's what they're relying on, I suspect that that's not right, that it had to do with a different subject matter.              Say I was lawfully stopped. All right.     Go ahead.     I want to get all of them in front of me.              The question is, how did she do that?              She said, "You can leave whatever time you want"?              No.     No.              So you're standing there and the policeman is in front of you, and they have stopped the car, and the woman who is the policeman says, "I want to search you."             Do you think you're free to leave? (Laughter.)              Okay, then.      So now we have got two of them.   What's the third?              No, it was on the highway.              It was in an urban area. Okay.     You're stopped in an urban area.                   The policeman says you are stopped, and you are stopped lawfully. Will you get out of the car?              Yes.       The policeman begins to search for the -- the gun.               Fine.         You think you're free to leave?              What's the fourth?          What's the fourth?     I just want to get them all out here.                   Is there anything else?              Okay.       So, what they say is a reasonable person would have found -- felt that he could just say good-bye, and he would have felt this even though the car was stopped lawfully, she asked him to get out of the car, and she began to search him for a gun.              I say, can we not reverse that?              No, I'm saying if the question is whether the person reasonably thought at the time of the search he could leave, there's certainly a strong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did not reasonably think he could leave.                      As long as that is so, the issue in front of us is when you stop a person, a policeman in the course of your duties, and that person thinks that he cannot reasonably leave, and you believe reasonably that he's armed, can you pat him down?     Well, asked that way, certainly a strong argument, the answer is yes, if you don't want to be killed.              Suppose we go beyond.             I mean, once we go beyond, I become a little at sea as to what the answers are because policemen do things other than investigate crime. A policeman is on protective duty.                     The individual he is protecting is approached by a member of the Crips gang, who has a bulge in his pocket.                    Can the police, with reasonable grounds to think that that person is armed, pat down that person?                 Or is he supposed to wait until the gun comes out of the pocket and the person who is being protected is shot? A policeman is on a bridge.                       Somebody stops the car in the middle of the bridge.                      Traffic is held up in all directions.      The policeman goes to try to remove the car from the bridge.           In the back seat is a member of the Crips gang with a bulge in his pocket.                      Is the policeman supposed to ignore that? I mean, policemen do many things, and once you tell me that we're going beyond the facts of this case, I can think of all kinds of hypotheticals that aren't so hypothetical, and I become uncertain about when the policeman can and when he cannot. So, how do you respond?              Is there any dispute on the underlying facts?              No.               What are the facts?       That is, this happened quite close to the beginning of the -- of the stop, didn't it?               We don't know.       I -- I read this.    But it said -- I mean I thought, from judging it, that it did happen within a few minutes of the -- of the beginning.     They were still talking to the driver.               We know that.               We don't?               Yes.               Well, is there any reason to think it was half an hour?             Is it lawful to possess a firearm?             Was he convicted?
07-1125 +++$+++               Are you saying -- are you -- is this what you are saying:                We imagine that we have a institution that is receiving Federal assistance, okay?     And we also imagine that somebody is claiming that on the basis of gender they have been excluded from participating in, or denied the benefit of, or have been subject to discrimination. Are you saying that it is impossible for anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be held the defendant did not violate Title IX, but in which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection Clause?    There is no such circumstance; no one can imagine one.    Is that what you are saying?              You cannot imagine one. And you think no one can imagine one.                     So the obvious question on rebuttal is, since we have limited it to that universe, it would be the other side must imagine one?               That's simple.             Does a disparate-impact claim violate section -- Title IX?             If it's an individual, under Title IX you can't bring the suit.             All right.       But you could under 1983?             Okay.             So your point then is -- and that's why I have had trouble with this case -- is that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort of seems to say, "if there is a difference, of course you can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference, you can't."    I mean, everybody here seems to agree to that, I guess. So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between suing an institution and suing an individual.            So maybe what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't say it.               So you were saying if it's an individual acting in his official capacity, you cannot sue him under Title IX?               Yes.      Okay.               Then their answer to that which is now say, look, we want to sue an individual in his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our 1983 suit.   And then you reply, but there are bars here of collateral estoppel.          Claim preclusion, whatever it is.               They all have new names. (Laughter.)               The -- the -- okay, so that's your argument. So why don't we just send it back, say that's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983; indeed, that's the only place can you bring it; it's not precluded by Title IX, and now court, you go decide whether claim preclusion exists, or whatever they call it.     Collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I mean.
07-1209 +++$+++                And so, why not just say that?    What's the big problem of saying, judge, and then you say just what you said?              And then the judge again won't be in doubt any more.              So there's no need for this case because, either -- either -- either the veteran's agency will say, look, I walked that veteran through the process, I walked him through the process, walking him through the process he was told everything he needed to know, and there is no real problem here.                   It's just a formality that he didn't get the notice.                   And if that's true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me that that's wrong, and here was something, okay? On the other hand, we have your case.                  Your case, she didn't go to the doctor.                   If she went to the doctor, maybe she would have found something out. Again, I have no doubt, there is harmful error.   So this case is a theoretical law professor's case that is never going to come up, because there is never any doubt.   Either the VA did walk him through it and it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up with anything, or she can come up with something.              It certainly does because it makes sense to tell the government:                      Government, you have to come up with every possible conceivable factual scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.              I know all this and why don't you just tell the judge that and say:                   Look at my client, judge, look at my client.                  My client obviously isn't going to understand what to do unless the client is told.     And here my client wasn't told. I'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're going to win, okay? So what I can't figure out is how to deal with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in any real situation.              Well, it seems -- what I was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get there -- it seems to me that if something really went wrong, if there -- there's no notice, that "veteran, you have to put in some material, or you are going to lose," if there is no notice of that, and he really didn't get any notice during all this cooperative process, then I think the Veteran's Court is right.                   At that point I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt. But if he got the notice -- and there'll be a few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot of them he would have had something to produce.                They know it, we don't know.         The Veteran's Court knows.            Now the other three matters -- who is supposed to produce what, and do you have general knowledge, can you produce whatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare that a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not knowing the second, third and fourth. And therefore, I think he better come forth to explain in the brief, in the brief, why this matters. Now, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set up.   They know about it.         They set that up.      It's common sense.    So, how do I get to a legal result that says just that?    Or can I or should I?              Why is that such a tough thing to do?     It sounds like it's sort of -- is there some law out there that stops you from saying in the brief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to know, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have some now that we want to present to them.                    That's all. And then if I see that, I would say, my goodness -- and you describe it in three sentences.                    Now what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing that, does it?     What stops you from doing that?              They stop you, but the Veterans Court said to do it.               So -- and they are the one who know this area and they said you should have to do it.              Between me and the Veterans Court, as to who knows best how to work this system, it's ten to one it's not me.              What they decided there is if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what you want.   But if it's one of these other three, far more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it makes a difference. That's their conclusion.                    What's wrong with that?               -- but I don't understand that.   I mean, let's suppose, contrary to your wishes, that the client was not hurt.              He was hurt by some other thing, nothing to do with the bazooka.                    That's not your client -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything else is the same. Well, does that mean because they forgot to tell the client that the client has to go and produce some evidence, and she thought the Veterans Administration would produce all the evidence?                     Because they forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?               That doesn't seem --               I know.          Now you are going to be back in the remand and you now have to produce some evidence, don't you, or you lose?             So then why is it a big deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in the brief?    We're back where we started.             I might have called them a proffer.    I just want to say it's a description in the brief of how you're hurt.
07-1216 +++$+++              I would say the 28 cases are not quite as clear as I suggested.                  That is, I couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable situation.             In each instance it seemed as if one of two things was the case:                   Either, A, where the instruction was in error, it really was the matter brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway. Now, which of those cases do you think -- I am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they are not perfect.               What -- what you can't tell from that is what was the part of the sympathy instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel of the part that the -- that the appellant was complaining about.              But I remember that, because they said on that one -- some floor covering thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad floors or designing the floors wrong --              If that's the case, what they said was:     Don't worry about it because basically he did give you the instruction that you wanted, though in a different way --              -- and besides that, they added --              You're right.              In the last one, what I have here is that the court said the so-called requested instruction was never requested at all --              -- at all.              What is the -- what is the -- I will go look at that again.                But what is the standard?    I mean, remember, I think what your brother said at the end is correct.             Imagine that yours is a death case and we have said as a matter of Federal law that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we send it back.    And the court then says:                 Oh, we forgot; there are a couple of matters of State law here that bar the Federal consideration of the death question.                   And here they are.    And then they come up with just this. Is this -- is this a situation where you would be equally -- that's my problem.                   And so, put yourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would do if this is the death case and not the case that you have?               I'm just imagining that what has happened is that the instruction that they have given for the defendant in the death case violates Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked from considering it because there are these two other State grounds that mean that the lawyer --               Okay.              What are the elements? Imagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to put pen to paper on this.            Suppose they win in this. Then we will be back at the State law issue that I thought was going to be there, which was the issue of -- you are talking about the colloquy.                       Did they give the essence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't they?     And then look how cooperative the judge was, et cetera.    But that isn't before us now. What is before us now is something that blocks our consideration of that or anybody's consideration of that.         And imagine this is not your case; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case, that's why I used a death example, and we go through exactly the same thing.          And then the court does exactly the same thing, the State court, that happened here. And now what are the words that distinguish whether the court is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody the runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an absolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law? Which really they should have gone into first and saved everybody a lot of trouble.             Yes.                Well, what they say is -- look at the two errors they found.                  One is in saying "may" instead of "shall," and the other is in saying "illicit profit" instead of "profit."                    And they are pretty picky.    So, this is very picky, they say.                  And not only are they being picky, but they are being picky after the event.    And they could have raised it first, and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of these cases is right on point because the subject matter is, you know, closer bound up.               And so they put all this together and say it's an unreasonable application of a rule that was there.       And you say --              Sorenson was the agent and the principal, the broker who was selling some land.              And I think in that case they also said, "By the way, you've got basically the instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked" -- no, that was the case where they said, "You overlooked in your instruction an important allegation of fact," which allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a broker.              We didn't say it was in error.     I mean, there is nothing wrong with that. (Laughter.)
07-1223 +++$+++                 I'm still trying to understand the statute.         I think their point is we get around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district court here, the Federal district court, found that it was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because of the procedure.    In other words, the State that barred this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and therefore the determination of the facts is unreasonable.   So you're saying that isn't what those words "unreasonable determination of the facts" mean.               You mean you're saying that (d)(2), "unreasonable determination of the facts," means the factual outcome.      In other words, if the factual outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.               No?     I thought you just said that in answer to Justice Souter.               And not whether their procedures are correct?               Okay.               Okay.       So that's the first thing we have to decide to get to the question.                    If your wrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it -- if you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d).                    So they say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within (a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay. They say we are rid of (e) because of that.                   Now, how they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't in the case.              They're arguing due diligence.              (I).      You mean of (e)(2) --              (E)(2).              Okay.       So we also get -- they get around that because they say the due diligence. You also have an argument about how (2) applies.                  And if you're wrong about both of those then we get to the question, which would be:            If the -- if the hearing's properly before us and it's a new claim -- it's also saying it's a new claim -- if it's a new claim it has to be exhausted.   So under Virginia law, under Virginia law, is it really true that -- suppose, not this case, but suppose a Defendant 140 days after discovers the DA says, makes some remark.         He couldn't have known about it.   He goes to a special file.             He couldn't have found out about.   And lo and behold, it's the worst thing you can imagine, and you can imagine some pretty bad ones but this is even worse.        Now under Virginia law are you -- is it your view that Virginia courts would say you're out of luck, good-bye?             No matter what, it's goodbye?             No excuse?       Even if --             Okay.             So they are right about, they are right about the exhaustion being futile.             The first time he discovers DNA evidence in the DA's file that shows he couldn't have done it, there is no way to get relief under Virginia law?             Not in State court.             Okay, then they're right about that.             Okay, then let me ask you on the merits.    If he's right there and it's exhaustion and it really was a new claim, then wouldn't we apply a decision that does not defer to the State court, because after all the State court never heard this issue?             Okay.       There is no real argument between the two of you as to the -- as to the issue that we thought was presented.             But there's certainly an argument --             If it's really a new claim, you're going to say they applied --
07-1239 +++$+++               I didn't see evidence to the contrary on two important points.                     The first was that the Navy had affidavits which says -- they say -- I read them.     Maybe I just missed the contrary.                  But they said that:     You are requiring us, judge, to turn the sonar down to six decibels or up to six, whatever, whenever we had to run into a situation called layering of different temperature levels.                 And we tell you, as naval officers, that that's just where submarines like to hide.     And we also tell you that if we can't train people to do that they will miss out on an important part of how to find these submarines. I saw no answer to that. The second thing they said was that:                   We're willing to turn off the sonar if there's any marine mammal that comes within 500 yards, which is a quarter of a mile, about.     But you insist that we turn off the sonar when any animal comes within a mile and a quarter. And that's quite a big distance more.                     A lot of animals come in there, and if we have to turn off the sonar all those times, we are not going to be able to get much training done. Now, those two things seem to be quite important.    And I just might have missed, which I might have, which is why I'm asking, what the response was by equivalent experts to those points.             What do you mean, despite the complete absence?             That's the whole point. That's why I thought they didn't prove anything.            Fine, they went on some exercises and they didn't run into these layered things.      So obviously they couldn't have training.             Now, what they are saying is, when you do run into that situation you've got to train people to deal with it.            It doesn't prove much that when you didn't run into it they didn't train people to deal with it.        How could they have?              That's what I can't -- look, I don't know anything about this.                   I'm not a naval officer.     But if I see an admiral come along with an affidavit that says -- on its face it's plausible -- that you've got to train people when there are these layers, all right, or there will be subs hiding there with all kinds of terrible weapons, and he swears that under oath.     And I see on the other side a district judge who just says, you're wrong, I then have to look to see what the basis is, because I know that district judge doesn't know about it, either. So, the basis so far I'm thinking on this one is zero.     That's -- because what you have told me is they completed some exercise where they didn't find any layering.              Generalities.       You see -- of course, I agree with you as a generality.                  What I am missing here is the specifics, because I am nervous about it, as you can see.           And what I am nervous about is that there just wasn't enough on the other side, on your side.               This is -- I want to give you a chance to say what's so terrible about what they're doing.     I will express a little frustration. Not your fault.     But why couldn't you work this thing out?   I mean, they are willing to give you quite a lot of conditions, and you say, well, we have got to have more conditions.     And you are asking us who know nothing about whales and less about the military to start reading all these documents to try to figure out who's right in the case where the other side says the other side is totally unreasonable.             And the issue at law seems to be something that is going to last for two months. So -- so, why?          What is so -- what is the important thing here?              I don't under -- I don't understand how it's supposed to work.                    Of course they are going to do something that is harmful.              You see the point, I am trying to give you a -- overstating it.              You go on a bombing mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact statement first?              No.              How does it work?              I don't see why you backed down on this. (Laughter.)
07-1309 +++$+++               When you say "individual," the first part of the definition of "enterprise" speaks about any individual partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity.              So then, I've read somewhere that people feel that where that individual is involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal entity such as a sole proprietorship.                     Is that right?              I'm talking about a legal entity.     And in the second clause, what we are talking about here, specifically, it is "a corporation, a union, or a group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."              Two people -- two people walk along the street and know each other, suppose that's the example, and one of them says I have a great idea.     Let's go in and take some money out of the post office.    The other says, what happens if a policeman comes?    The first one says, we'll bribe him.              Okay. Then they do it.    That's it.            Period. Now, of course that's illegal.              But is RICO supposed to catch that?              What is it that keeps them out of it?              Well, here we have two -- two -- two related crimes.              There was between the two.                That is the bribery.     What happens if three months from now the postal inspector comes to catch us, we will bribe him.                You are quite right, I agree with you that these are different efforts to try to catch the same problem.           And the problem is that I don't think anyone sees that the simple conspiracy in carrying out of two criminal offenses by several people together without more -- without something more should violate RICO.    I think your answer to that would be you agree with that, but tell me if you don't. And then if you do agree with it, the very difficult problem is to figure out how to get the people to clearly show a pattern or not.              What did you think -- what did you think of the -- probably not much of it, but what did you think of my effort there?                   And I am trying to point out, as you see, I am open to anything that will deal with what I think of as a functional problem and the functional problem is exhibited by that Posner example I gave you or by two investment companies that decide, what we will do is we will issue a letter that is going to be shown to two different people; that is their only association; or maybe 100 people, but they know who they are, and they are going to be shown this letter over a period of five or 10 years, and someone later comes back and says there is a false statement in the letter.    Well, they shouldn't issue a false statement, but is that RICO? I mean, so -- so the object -- the object is to find a way of not overextending RICO where there is nothing there but a conspiracy to commit two crimes. Pattern is one help.       The pattern is pretty vague, so all the courts but one have come along, I take it, with this other help, which is playing on the word structure. Now you have heard what I said as a weak effort to try to do something.               What is your best effort to do something to deal with the problem?                Or what's wrong with my effort?       Whatever you want to say.             That's different. That's -- of course the same evidence can establish two separate elements.              The problem will be conflating the elements so that every single case that you have the first set, you also have the second set.              No, no.             Always, in a case where you sue the investment company because of their one letter used four times, it's the act of the individual.                  In the case that Posner used, it's always the act of the individual.    There's always a criminal act of an individual.             And he has to be associated, however, with an enterprise for it to fall within RICO, and there also has to be a pattern.             That's going back --              That's right, and our problem is he is doing it with one other person whom he met once, and they agreed to do it, and it's a common law conspiracy; and now suddenly he has done it twice with another person who helped him and they said they would do it, and now we have RICO; and my belief is -- which you may not agree with -- that that common garden-variety conspiracy to say, rob a bank and then transport the money a few months later, that that's all that's at issue.     That shouldn't be within RICO.              You might come back and tell me it should be.
07-1315 +++$+++               But there is no hole in the statute.    What it says to do, quite explicitly, is it says that you have to see whether the State court decision was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the State court.              So it tells us what to do.   It says, look at the evidence in the State court, and like any other instance where there is no hearing, every day of the week, judges refuse to give a hearing. Now, when they do that, they have to assume the facts in favor of the losing party.           So the question is, assuming the facts in favor of your client, was the decision that he loses unreasonable?              And you said yes.        Is there any finding on that in the Federal court?                 No.              All right.       Now, that's -- that's why I don't know how to proceed because it seems to me to decide that question just as I said it.                 When I said it, I don't think what I said is clear in the law of this statute.   There are two sides to it.                We just had a case where there were many briefs on this question.   So I'm slightly uncertain what to do.              That's a good one.              That's the law of the Federal Government, I would have thought.               It's summary judgment law.               That's my fault.     I'm referring by shorthand to a Rule 56 summary judgment type standard.   All those facts are assumed on your side in which they're material, and there has to be in the evidence a reasonable basis for dispute.              That's my mistaken refusal to -- I should have said Rule 56.                Well, what about -- what do you do with the last sentence of the supreme -- of the California Court of Appeals' opinion?                    "None of the exculpatory evidence defendant recites, including evidence of his mental disorder, was reasonably likely to persuade a jury that defendant did not premeditate and deliberate the killing."             And from that they conclude that there is no reasonable probability that, but for the errors, a different verdict would have been reached, i.e., that it does not satisfy the second part of Strickland.                I was just reading from the California court of Appeals.             Because I look at that.         I think when I go back and see what was the evidence in front of them, I am going to find all of these -- all of these things.    Not the last part by the way, not -- not the part about the counsel admitting he was wrong or whatever this argument we are having.                    We won't find that, but we'll find everything else there. And so they're using that as the basis to say there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer to that finding on prejudice.            Now, what's your response to that?
07-1356 +++$+++               Wasn't this individual represented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?              And he was represented by counsel at the time that the informant took the statement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?              I have my memo that I haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite interested. I thought he asked for counsel.            He was given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement was elicited. I would like to know that because the Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, "Don't talk to informants in the jailhouse."              He could have said, "I'm going to talk to who I want." Or he might not have. But I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance of counsel at the time the statement was elicited?              It's one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't. Don't know?             How can I find out?             So it might be he asked for counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?                 I see the problem. I wonder if you have an answer to another question. You may not. I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the Michigan case. The other cases were decided even earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the question of whether the State can introduce into evidence a statement made when the State questioned an individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of the presence of the counsel. I mean, does that normally happen, or does it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do you have any idea?              That's what I'm not certain about.   And this is why I ask -- have been asking these questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is this. I ask for a lawyer.              The State has some period of time to give me a lawyer.                      Now it's one thing if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they are supposed to do it.        But that isn't as basic -- that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give me one, though it should. That's a different violation, a different kind of violation.      One is a kind of a rule of ethics incorporated in the Constitution.                  The second is what the case is -- is what the Constitution is really about, give him a lawyer when he asks for one.                      And which is this case?    That -- that's why I'm having hard time.                      Is it the first or the second?              No, no, no.          I will amalgamate that for you.           I will say they are exactly the same thing.    But what I want to know is what rule is violated, what Sixth Amendment rule.                      The rule -- you heard what I said, the rule "don't talk to a guy who wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer."                      No communications with a client.               It's a communication with the lawyer.    That's one thing. And the other rule is he has asked for a lawyer but you never gave him one.                   Now which is this case?   I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a lawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a lawyer, and they haven't violated that second. If you have any view on that, it would be helpful to me.
07-1372 +++$+++                You concede -- you concede that the Apology Resolution does not say that the Hawaiian people's claims are valid.               Does it say that?   Yes or no.               Okay, so if that's so, do you object to a three-sentence pro curiam opinion in this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaiian Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be enjoined, the Court made a mistake; and insofar as it is resting on State law, that's up to them.               Do you think your draft --             How could it have done that?   I mean, I didn't see anything in here that suggests anything like that.             That is to suggest that the Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part of the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was worked out.    Now I have read this Apology Resolution about six times, and I certainly didn't see anything like that.              You agree that the Apology Resolution does not say who's right about the claim?              Like what?              What?              If I said that -- just in the opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing else about the resolution, say we don't see any other way in which the resolution could have supported this, would that -- is that okay with you?             It also, I guess, has a -- there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust. They hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in the trust, and only one of those relates to the Native Hawaiians.    Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set up is the subject of controversy continuously. So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't have to get into this -- is what the relation between the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions Resolution.    Is there any law going to anything like that?
07-1410 +++$+++                So you are saying that 635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates a fiduciary duty?               That's the part that I'm not getting. You are saying -- the question, I guess, basically is, does the language of 635(a) that says with the approval of the Secretary, the Indians can, among other things, for business purposes lease the land. Right?   That's what it says?               And that doesn't seem much different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me. It doesn't seem different at all.                 But now you are saying, no, it's really different because look at (b) and (c), that's your basic argument?             I look at (b) and (c) and it says -- when you lease something under (b) and (c) which is not (a) -- (b) and (c) -- you have to have this all supervision, and so forth, or it has to be at a fair value, something like that; is that right?   (B) and (c) say that land is owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't want to delay you on this.          I thought that (b) and (c), you were saying, create an obligation -- create more of a trust obligation.             So why does that -- why does that mean that this Act creates a trust relationship?                Thank you, but now what of course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see, if this -- is this statute stronger for you than the statute we already considered?               And I start with some suspicion, because I think if it is a stronger statute for you, you would have argued it the last time.                 So I wonder why you didn't.                So somebody thought maybe it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that suspicion aside.                So anyhow that's the fundamental question in my mind.                I look at the language and so forth, but the language doesn't seem any stronger for you, at least at first blush.              That isn't really my question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last time; and looking at it straight afresh, I think when the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would, the first thing they do is look at the words of the old statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try to figure out if the new statute that you cited is somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one was.              Okay.       So what have we got here in that respect?        What we seem to have is two later provisions that say the government shall have no liability when it enters into leases.                     I mean, maybe that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly escaping it.     And then I guess there is some regs that were promulgated after the lease was entered into and seem on their face to deal with other matters.                     Okay, now, what am I missing?                 Well the regs you didn't emphasize, so forget them.            If you don't want to rely on them we won't. The -- but I've looked for everything I could find that would support you on this basis --                 -- and there you are, so I want to you add something to explain --             Okay.
07-1428 +++$+++              I have purposely gone, of course, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's the controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there are two examples in that opinion.               One is strategic site selection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and the second is drawing attendance zones with a general recognition of the demographics.              Those are given as examples of instances where there is race consciousness, but it does not trigger strict scrutiny. Now, why is your case like that rather than being like those examples where an employer or a government official picks particular people or uses quotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention to race in an individual selection, both based on race, which clearly does require strict scrutiny?              And if there is a difference, even then why is yours justified?
07-1437 +++$+++  
07-1529 +++$+++                Just to clarify in my mind. Case one, the defendant has no lawyer.                        He is -- they give him Miranda warning.             He says:             I don't want a lawyer.     Okay.   Now, do you want to speak against yourself?     Yes, he says, I do.              Sorry, strike -- he says:     No, I don't; I don't want to say anything, but I don't want a lawyer. Six hours later the policemen say to him: Are you really sure that you don't want to speak?                           He says:     Well, maybe I will, and he makes a full absolutely voluntary decision.                 That's okay under the Constitution, right?              Okay.       Now, it's the same case, except this time he says:               I have a lawyer; I hired him yesterday.       Now the policeman cannot say, are you sure?    Is that correct?              That's the law.           So, the law is -- and the reason for that second is because once you have a lawyer, police communicate through the lawyer.    Isn't that the reason, basically?                    I just always thought that was the reason.                      Once a person has a lawyer, another lawyer communicates through the lawyer. They don't go and talk to the client.                     I thought that was the kind of rationale for it.                 Maybe I'm wrong.              Okay.       Now, if the --              I'm not talking about that.               I was trying to give a hypothetical and my hypothetical is a different one than you were just told.       In my hypothetical the person has a lawyer, and I thought where he has a lawyer the police are not allowed to go and ask him questions about whether he wants to waive.            Of course, he can volunteer it.   Am I right about that?               That's correct, that's correct.               Correct.               Correct, that's the conundrum of the case.         Now I understand it.       The conundrum of this case is he didn't tell the police, I have a lawyer.     He had one. Now, if he had hired one and not told the police, it would be the same result as we just said, wouldn't it?     If he had one but didn't tell the police, the police could not initiate questioning; am I right or wrong?    All I'm driving at is shouldn't the result here be the same?              The same whether you hired the lawyer or the same whether the lawyer was appointed? At least that's what's in my head.                  And if you can show me that you want the same result in both cases, that would go a long way towards convincing me.              He tells some of the police.   Some of the police know.                It just happens that these particular ones don't.              Can I ask -- I'm getting a different idea from what you're arguing.               I want to try it on you and see what your response is.               It's simply this, that there's something backwards about this case, and what's backwards is this, that when they're talking about a prophylactic rule in Jackson, what they're thinking of is the following:            Everyone agrees that when a person really has a counsel, at that point, unlike the Miranda point, the police cannot talk to him further, though he can initiate. Now, everyone agreeing, what do we do with a case where a person doesn't have a lawyer, but he requests one?   Now, in such a circumstance, we're going to treat it as if he had one.             That's the prophylactic part.   But here's a case where he really has one.                      So it doesn't fall outside Jackson.             It falls within the basic assumption of Jackson, that the difference between having a lawyer and not having a lawyer is, if you have a lawyer, the police can initiate nothing.                     You can't talk to him. Now, if that's right, your case -- I mean, I'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a fortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson. Now, explain to me why I've got it wrong.                Accept that, for argument's sake.   Accept that, and then same -- same question.              Interesting.     I think this is very interesting to me because I'm learning a lot. Suppose -- Let's assume Justice Alito is absolutely right and that when you have a counsel, that's what you've done and that's the reason why you don't talk to the police, or at least they can't initiate.                Fine. Take that as the rationale, and now apply it to this case.    Since he has a lawyer, whether he said yes, no, maybe, "I accept" or not, it would have nothing to do with it.     The same rationale would apply or would it?              Because?              I see.
07-1601 +++$+++                How does that differ from you using your printer, there's an ink cartridge and you replace them after a while, and mine has a little thing attached that says don't put it in your ordinary garbage bin because it's dangerous or whatever it is, put it in this envelope and do something? Now, I'm sure that HP makes those and knows that several million people won't do it.                    They will throw it in the garbage bin, and they ship to it me. All right.    Are they now arrangers?               Because?               Oh, some?        No, probably millions.    I don't know anybody who does put it in the right garbage can. (Laughter.)              Then how is that then different from Shell?      Shell here knows that to some degree their people are going to spill this.                   And, of course, shell arranged the transport.                   And in my imaginary hypothetical -- I don't really know -- so does HP.              Well, now maybe HP knows that there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer who -- (Laughter.) -- because I foolishly admitted at dinner that I dispose of them all improperly.                  Now are they Shell?              So then, suddenly if HP, in fact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have a common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car batteries, same problem.         They have their own trucks, and they -- or they use Fed Ex; I don't know.             And they, in fact, put in an instruction, which says:             Really do it; really put it in the special now.              I'm trying to find that point.   And what I have found you so far to say from the briefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it easy -- but what they did was they arranged the transport, that seems to me to be common, and they put some instructions in which said the right way to dispose of it.   Well, doesn't everybody do that?                 Independent but not at the time of the spill.               Then in your view what it is is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal when the company knows that the transporter on arrival may spill some of the product?               I guess then every oil company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in the United States is going to be -- fall within that because a lot of people do spill things.              No that's at that point, because I think you're focusing on the word.               You don't use the word "for" disposal, and I think that is the key word, and the question is intention versus purpose. So that in your trash hauler case, it seems to work pretty well for me that when we say that that trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the dump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its purpose. So how do we deal with that?                The statute tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that way.    Now, that seems to work. So we get your example.                      What doesn't seem to work is when you import the notion of intention in the sense of knowing that to the arranger provision, because at that point I don't see how -- and I have to buy that to get your argument.                At that point I do not see how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf on the shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right in the arranger provision and lots of other companies that shouldn't be held as arrangers.                      That's my problem. Are you following that?               It does say that, but my problem is I can't find in the distinctions that they made useful distinctions that will do that.                      It will say "many," but it won't say, for example, the car battery manufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own trucks to places where people will get them, and he knows that they're not going to do it properly no matter how hard he tries. Well, he's not an arranger.                He didn't arrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the transport for sale.
07-208 +++$+++               Why shouldn't the law track medicine?   I mean, we're not -- we're interested in a person having a fair trial.              Well, I didn't think this case has been decided by prior precedent.               I thought there was some opening here.            Going back to what I think I said in Martinez and Justice Kennedy said, we were -- I was interested in, and perhaps he was, in a few empirical facts, because we'd heard lots of complaints from trial judges who said this makes no sense at all. Very disturbed people are being deprived and end up in prison because they're disturbed rather than because there guilty. Now, I wanted to know the facts.           And it seemed to me we have a excellent, really fabulous -- that this has happened, and Professor Hashimoto seems to have gone and written, done research, which we have in front of us.    As I read that research, I first learned that actually the pro se defendants don't do a bad job of defending themselves.           And by and large, they do surprisingly well.      And so perhaps that eliminates some of the concern. But the other thing that it tells me is that there is a small subclass of pro se defendants who may in fact do badly.     And we have in front of us one of those individuals and that, therefore, a rule which permitted a State to deal with this subclass of disturbed people who want to represent themselves, who could communicate with counsel, but can't communicate with anybody else, that if we focus on that subclass and accept the State's argument here, interestingly enough, we've gone a long way to deal with a serious practical problem, and we've advanced the cause of seeing that individuals have a fair trial. So I'd like you to comment on that, and that was my reaction after reading that study.              Your response to that, as it was to me, I take it to be:                Well, focusing on this subclass, the judge has other ways of dealing with the problem.   My thought about that is, first, I don't know. Maybe the damage is done by that point before the jury or elsewhere. And my second thought is, because I'm not certain about whether your answer is right or wrong, nor are any of us really, this is a perfect instance where the States should experiment.              There isn't on this, but of course part of the job of being a psychiatrist or a psychologist or a doctor is continuously to evaluate the accuracy of studies.      So if it's a general question, I guess the question is of course there are.
07-21 +++$+++                  Well, if you're worried about fraud --                 If you're worried about fraud, what I don't understand, and I'd like to track it through with you, is the registration system.                  As I read the Indiana voter registration application, all a person has to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility bill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't have a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his Social Security; and if he doesn't have that either he doesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a number -- and you mail it in.             And you're registered. So all a person who have to do if he wants to be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and he has a photo ID; he can go to the polls.              So my question to you is this:         given that system of registration, focusing on the issue before us, why don't you just say and we'll give to you -- you put on -- if you don't have a photo ID, we'll give you one.              Now there it would not stand as an obstacle; that apparently is what Georgia has done.          And it doesn't require people to go out and spend $10 or $5 or something digging up their birth certificate, which if you tried to do, is quite a job for many people. And therefore, you'd have all the things you want.   All you would do is with the 43,000 people who don't have the IDs, you'd say we'll get you one.                No big deal.   You have a photo machine there when they come in to register; they have to go down; you take a picture of them and you hand it to them.             And I would think that that less restrictive way would satisfy your anti-fraud interests far better than the way you've chosen, but I leave my judgment out of it.           I just would like you to talk through why that isn't a less restrictive way, which is far better in achieving your anti-fraud interests, or at least as good.             We are going to give -- all we are doing is, we will give you the photo.               It has nothing to do with validity.           That photo proves that Mr. Smith who comes in and asks for it is the same Mr. Smith who registered to vote.               And that's all your system does in the first place.             So what is the answer to that?             I'm not arguing about that. I'm saying your whole -- I'll repeat it once more.                 I'm saying your whole system is a system designed to assure that the person at the voting booth is the same as the person who registers.      I accept that, absolutely right. And I'm simply saying given that, why didn't you say Mr. Proto -- Mr. Likely, like to register:                "Come in. If you don't have a photo ID, we will give you one." Now, what's the objection to that?
07-210 +++$+++               Well, I don't think it's because there's no common-law equivalent.                   I think it's simply because the word "conspiracy" is a -- the substantive violation under 19 -- under 1962(c).                   "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire."                   And we have to interpret the word "conspire," and we say we give it its common-law meaning; whereas, for a violation of the general racketeering statute, there's -- there's no equivalent reference to a word that we have to give content to.   It just says -- unless it's the word "indictable."
07-214 +++$+++              What you are saying is covered, I take it -- and this is -- I want to know how this has worked out -- what is covered is -- imagine government grant programs.           And suppose there are vast numbers of grant programs now that go to all kinds of entities throughout the country, and a large portion of which are just grants.        They're paid and the government is not going to get a penny back. Now, there are instances of frauds in such situations of subs against the person who gets the grant.   And in -- I can't imagine a case -- maybe imagine, but it would be imaginary -- where the Government couldn't say:          But we got less than the grant was supposed to pay for. And you're saying all those are covered.             Is that right?             To get less than it was supposed to get.             And so this is what surprises me on your side.           It's 20 years later.     And if all those things are covered, given the vast extent of government grant programs in the United States, has your interpretation worked to bring within this statute, and lots of qui tam cases against municipal frauds of all kinds, things that they just never thought of at the time of the Civil War?        Do you see what the question is?             Have there been a lot of such cases?              The difference is that government money today is in everything.               So if it's in everything, then everything is going to become subject to this False Claims Act.         And of course I exaggerate by using the word "everything," but only a little. (Laughter.)              Suppose -- you just said to Justice Scalia -- if you have one minute; I rather missed that -- that your point was if you lose on that point you just made and it isn't "with Federal funds" and it is that the government has to pay the claim, you still win.     That was your point to Justice Scalia, I guess.              Well, what was that argument?     Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and what is it?     How do you still win?              Yes.             Yes.
07-219 +++$+++               That's -- that's why I'm interested in the same question I asked on the other side.   As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first reading of it that it picked up this distinction that Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation where its managerial official is the one who causes -- who behaves recklessly.          But wait, we don't mean quite that.   We mean some managerial officials. And they seem to refer in the admiralty case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's captain.     He's not in that category.                   And then in this other case, they say -- they talk about a superintending agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the conductor. And they give that as an example of a managerial official where there would not be exemplary damages assessed against the corporation in light of his conduct. So when I read that, I thought that this Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and that's the Federal law.          And you've given the examples where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you are right.     You read the cases very well. But is there an example where I could say that the Federal law has changed, too?                    And you started down that track, but the reason this is of probably more than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it is. So what would you say to someone who has accepted certain legal principles that we have had in prior cases?     And you want to say nonetheless you win. Okay.   Why?               And so it differs from Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?               It differs from Sand?          You say it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark.                    In the Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it, public policy was on the other side.                    But -- but we had several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one very clearly, you know -- you see the point there.               Why do you say there is no stare decisis problem?              That wouldn't -- you might win on that one.   I mean if you show that.               They have -- we have to assume that that isn't so, don't we --              -- for purposes of this argument?              Yes.      Okay, that's all.              That's fine.              On the second and third, this is what --              -- some time available.       I would like you to address at some point at your convenience what should the standards be if, in fact, the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions, for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for punitives. Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of my mind is:    This is a very dramatic accident.         It involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of trouble.    But there are accidents every day, and ships are filled with accidents like automobiles in other places.    And there are all kinds of things that go wrong. And if, in fact, it has not been normal in admiralty until now to assess punitives against the corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will be a new world for the shipping industry and for those who work on the ships. What happens when a sailor slips and is hurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera? What principles do you have to suggest, if any, for creating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?               Why?      What's even the theory of that?   Because the theory of punitives is that the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one penny's worth?               And that really the money ought to go to the people generally in the State or it ought to go to other people, rather than those people who have already been compensated.                 That's the theory of it.              That exhibits the difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.             What is the relevance?             What's the relevance of the leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain, did bad things?             You seem to be now talking about the evidence that they did bad things.             But that's the leg that they did --             Well, doesn't that show, then, that there had to be a finding that they did the bad thing?
07-290 +++$+++               But I just want you to assume them for the purpose of the question.           All right. Assume that the -- that there is an individual right, but the purpose of that right is to maintain a citizen army; call it a militia; that that's the basic purpose.      So it informs what's reasonable and what isn't reasonable. Assume -- and this is favorable to you but not as favorable as you'd like -- assume that we are going to decide whether something is proportionate or apply an intermediate standard in light of the purpose. All right. Now, focus on the handgun ban.                  As I read these 80 briefs -- and they were very good, I mean really good and informative on both sides -- and I'm trying to boil down the statistics where there is disagreement, and roughly what I get -- and don't quarrel with this too much; it's very rough -- that 80,000 to 100,000 people every year in the United States are either killed or wounded in gun-related homicides or crimes or accidents or suicides, but suicide is more questionable.   That's why I say 80,000 to 100,000. In the District, I guess the number is somewhere around 200 to 300 dead; and maybe, if it's similar, 1,500 to 2,000 people wounded.                   All right. Now, in light of that, why isn't a ban on handguns, while allowing the use of rifles and muskets, a reasonable or a proportionate response on behalf of the District of Columbia?                 Well, I didn't read -- I read the two military briefs as focusing on the nature of the right, which was quite a pretty good argument there that the nature of the right is to maintain a citizen Army. And to maintain that potential today, the closest we come is to say that there is a right for people to understand weapons, to know how to use them, to practice with them.         And they can do that, you see, with their rifles.      They can go to gun ranges, I guess, in neighboring States. But does that make it unreasonable for a city with a very high crime rate, assuming that the objective is what the military people say, to keep us ready for the draft, if necessary, is it unreasonable for a city with that high crime rate to say no handguns here?              Now, why?              Well, you want to say yes, that's correct, but I want to hear what the reasoning is because there is a big crime problem.                  I'm simply getting you to focus on that.              That brings me back to the question because Blackstone describes it as a right to keep and bear arms "under law."             And since he uses the words "under law," he clearly foresees reasonable regulation of that right.         And so does the case not hinge on, even given all your views, on whether it is or is not a reasonable or slightly tougher standard thing to do to ban the handgun, while leaving you free to use other weapons? I mean, I notice that the militia statute, the first one, spoke of people coming to report, in 1790, or whenever, with their rifles, with their muskets, but only the officers were to bring pistols. So that, to me, suggests they didn't see pistols as crucial even then, let alone now.              What's your response to the question?                Why -- now, when say "keep" and "bear," I mean you are -- I think you're on to something here.   Because you say let's use our common sense and see what would be the equivalent today.              Fine. If we know that at the time, in 1789, Massachusetts had a law that said you cannot keep loaded firearms in the house, right, and you have to keep all of the bullets and everything and all of the powder upstairs, why did they have that law?                     To stop fires They didn't have fire because it's dangerous? Now we do -- or they weren't as good. departments. We now have police departments, and the crime wave might be said similar to what were fires And, therefore, applying the similar kind of then. thing, you say:     Fine, just as you could keep pistols loaded but not -- not loaded.               You had to keep powder upstairs because of the risk of fire.                     So today, roughly, you can say no handguns in the city because of the risk of crime. Things change.         But we give in both instances, then and now, leeway to the city and States to work out what's reasonable in light of their problems.   Would that be a way of approaching it?              Not self-defense being the harm.   And I agree with you that this, the firearm analogy, floats up there, but it isn't going to decide this case, the Massachusetts statute.                    I agree with you about that. What you've suddenly given me the idea of doing, which I'm testing, is to focus not just on what the kind of weapon is --          don't just look to see whether it's a cannon or a machine gun, but look to see what the purpose of this regulation is, and does it make sense in terms of having the possibility of people trained in firearms? Let's look at those military briefs.                  Let's say that the generals have it right, there is some kind of right to keep trained in the use of firearms subject to regulation.   We have regulation worried about crime, back to my first question.              Thinking of your exchange with the Chief Justice and think of the trigger lock in your view and what the question was, do you want -- I don't know how well trigger locks work or not -- but do you want thousands of judges all over the United States to be deciding that kind of question rather than the city councils and the legislatures that have decided it in the context of passing laws?             I mean, isn't there an issue here and a problem with respect to having courts make the kinds of decisions about who is right or not in that trigger-lock argument?              Whose judgment is that to --
07-308 +++$+++              Your point is that you don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422 if the government was -- although it did ask for the money as a tax, they are really out to lunch?              I mean, the trouble -- is there any authority for an argument like that?   I mean, the trouble I guess that I would have that argument is, one is linguistic, because it goes on to say "or of any sum alleged to have been excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected." And then the other thing is just common sense:   Suppose you have an insane tax collector.              You know, I mean, that could happen.                And the insane tax collector they discover some years later has been assessing all these penalties for no reason and people have been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy, terrible thing.    But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always thought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so even those it's really nuts. Now, is there -- is there any authority for us making a distinction between an insane -- to get an extreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a wrongful assessment of a tax?                Okay.                What about the "any sum," "in any manner"?   You know, what about that language?                "Any sum in any manner wrongfully collected."              No.     No.      Their argument is, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is you paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a refund, go through the administrative procedure.              In looking at your argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right.                    You're -- that it would have very broad reach.                    It would reach -- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS.                    And there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too far out, you can go get an injunction.                   That's what you're pointing to.     And then you're argument is, because of that authority, that kind of an exception for the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of limitation and administrative requirement.                    And your problem is the latter has never been held.                    And the reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about basic equity, but when you're talking about later on administrative requirements, there's really no reason they couldn't have filed the claim.                    And if we were to accept an argument on the -- to the contrary and analogize it, it's going to cut through rules, regulations, statutes, constitutional claims, everything, really making a hash of their provision there -- of the administrative provision.                     So, what is your response to that thought which --               What do you want to do about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to get the money back.     It has to do with the nature of the IRS's defense and -- well, can you do it that way?                    Can you say the word "any tax" or "any claim" -- I can't remember that other.      What was it?             It was any -- "any sum" -- "any sum" or "any tax."              Can you say, well, it means one thing if they are saying that the reason they want it back is that it violates the Constitution, and those words mean a different thing if the reason that you want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates an IRS statute.             Well, if it doesn't mean anything different and then if the very far-out claim to a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true in the regulation context, in the statutory context as well as the constitutional context.                     Am I missing something?
07-312 +++$+++               So there is no case, to your knowledge -- not millions of dollars, but there is no case, to your knowledge, where, in fact, people transferred the assets; they thought there would be a plan confirmed; there was no plan confirmed; and then the State was not paid?
07-320 +++$+++              Can you back to Justice Kennedy's question, where as I took it he identifies a problem that he sees in this portion of this act which, should the limit be exceeded by our opponent, then we can go to the party and the party can give us more? Now, assume for the sake of argument that he has correctly identified a problem with that.                  Now, my understanding is that once the limit is exceeded and you have this extra amount, three things happen:                  One, an individual could contribute two or three times the amount to the party directly.               A second possibility is an individual who has exceeded the global amount now gets a bump up and can contribute.                   And the third thing is the party thing. So focus on that statute where this is written.     In your opinion, if, for the sake of argument, there were a problem with the party, would that particular form of words in the statute be severable from the rest of it?
07-330 +++$+++                 Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I thought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say the same thing as (1)?        It says if the sentence is too high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as the court considers appropriate.                Subject to (g), which has to do with the district court. Then the other part says if it is too low and it was the government that appealed, the court shall set it aside and send it back with such instructions as it considers appropriate, again subject to (g). So all three say the same thing. Not if it's too high and                That's what -- Not if it's too high and  If it's too high and the                I see.              The way to do this then is -- is -- I see -- this section foresees basically what the other side is saying.           It foresees it, because it's a very unusual case what happened here.              So the way you should handle it, given this section, is the court of appeals would send -- I'm trying this on -- the court of appeals says, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who appealed.    He says the sentence is too high.                   Given what we have in front us in the issues, he's right; now we've noticed that there's is other problems here.                     So what we do is send it back for resentencing.                     And, Judge, when you resentence, look at it.              And see if maybe we're right.   That would be a perfectly fair way to handle it, and a normal way to handle it.               Is that right?                But you don't have --              Well, could do you this? Because this is quite helpful to me.                     Reading, I started out where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of this argument.   I thought the district court normally has it open, to the judge, to resentence.                  Resentence is resentence.   You can't be vindictive, but that's the limit.   That's how it works normally, I thought. And given -- if that's so, then you look at the three sections we just saw, try to read them together, and say they certainly are written with the notion that the noticing of a plain error on the other side is going to be few and far between if ever. So the normal way to handle it is just what we said:   The judge decides on the record and the appeal -- I decide this for the defendant here.                 But I've noticed something, says the writing judge.                 And of course it's open on resentencing to go into that.              So if you were going to do something other than that, in the court of appeals, you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a fairly good reason.      So you don't close off the escape hatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly, but you say it's going to be few and far between. Now does that work?              All right.
07-343 +++$+++               There is no -- there is doubt in my mind that this particular kind of crime has not been the subject of a Supreme Court opinion.                    My problem is I can think of many, many awful, truly horrible circumstances that categorized in many different -- under many different criminal statutes; I'm not a moralist.   I'm a judge.            As a judge, I look at the law.   It seems for 43 years, no one has been executed but for murder. Moreover, this Court has never approved the execution for any crime other than murder in those 43 years.   Right. If I accept your argument, since I'm not a moralist, since I can think of horrible things all over the place, have I then opened the door so that, in fact, States will find lots of different crimes which are seriously horrible; and suddenly, we will be in the business of creating under the Constitution some kind of highly complex categorization, really a moral categorization of crime, method of commitment, method of, et cetera, et cetera.              So the answer is yes?   Your answer is if we take your position and that's -- I'm not saying it's not a good argument, just take your position, but if we take your position, I can think of instances of kidnapping; I can think of instances of torture.   I can think of instances all over the place which are truly horrible. But then to take your position, what we're going to do is we are going to say legislatures all over the country do have the right under the Constitution to go, try to categorize horrible by horrible, not just death.   Not just murder.              Perhaps at the time, 200 years ago, that's true. (Laughter.)              And it's not true -- I've read the definition of section 41 of rape under the Louisiana code.   I won't repeat it but it's very broad. And it can broad in the sense that rape itself can include a vast number of instances of child molesting, each of which is bad; but there are degrees.              So I suppose that child molesting of all those kinds that are listed in 41 (c) (1) and (2), which you know I'm sure, would count as rape if committed on a person under 12. Some are absolutely horrible.              Some are just bad.    But that's what the other side means when he says it gives tremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and choose who should be executed needs further narrowing. What's your response.              Those are the only two.         So these other things don't count.              Thank you.              Can you -- can you give me one second on my own error here, but I just traced the statute through.   What I did was I looked at section 42. It says, "aggravated rape is a rape committed upon, et cetera," and then it says "where the victim is under the age of 13."   Right.     So it doesn't say what rape is.           So I assumed it picked up the definition of rape from section 41.   And section 41 defines rape as anal or oral or vaginal sexual intercourse, and then in section three it defines oral. Now am I right; is that the correct statutory thing, or is there some other statute?               All right.               Then I go back to my if that is the right statutory thing, because it seems to cover, particularly in its definition of oral intercourse, a very wide range of child molesting, all of which I agree is quite bad, but it's still a very, very wide range.               I didn't say it wasn't.               No, I mean, my question relates back to what Justice Souter was talking about, about the narrowing of the statute.              You started out by saying it's the worst cases of child abuse, and that's -- child rape -- and that's why I was interested in the definition.   It seems to me this definition simply covers all instances of some kind of physical intercourse with a child, including oral, vaginal, anal. I can't imagine one that wouldn't be covered if the victim of this is under the age of 13. Now, am I right in thinking it's not the worst instances; it's every instance of rape defined that way?              Thank you.              So the amendment --              Thank you.      I see.              Will you give us one sentence or two on the response to all the professionals who've commented in the briefs in saying the death penalty here will make this situation worse?

07-411 +++$+++  
07-440 +++$+++                What happens in Texas?             But they didn't -- they don't --             What is the law here in Texas in respect to this particular magistration proceeding?   I noticed what happened is that the magistrate tells the person arrested, he says precisely: "I find probable cause to believe" that you -- "that there was probable cause to arrest you."                  That's what they say, right?   It said:          "I have determined that probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual accused therein." All right.       Now, what happens -- and I think it would be helpful to know the answer to this -- in what might be a rare instance, but the truth of the matter is there was probable cause to arrest that individual when he was arrested, but there isn't now. So because he came in -- you know, he said here's 14 cousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all agree.   I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that means there isn't now.        And what I'm driving at is does the magistrate here -- is he required, does he have the power to commit someone, even though he honestly believes there is no longer probable cause, in which case he is making the decision, the magistrate, not the policeman?              I could -- I can think there would be tremendous constitutional significance and it would make a difference if all that's really happening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which case we might have liberty interests and others at issue.   But what's happening in this proceeding is that the magistrate is deciding that there is probable cause to hold him, in which case it's more like, not completely like, but more like what happens in an indictment or an arraignment, et cetera.               No, no.          But I want to know what's Texas law, if you know it, in respect to that question?                So we have a magistrate who has to find that there is -- no, to make the arrest or to hold him now?   Do you see what I'm doing?                Do you see why I'm doing it?   So, what's the answer, if you know?                No, I know there may not be, but what about in general.              Okay.       That's what I would think.   In which case we have before us bringing this person before a State official who himself has the power to decide if there is probable cause to hold him, and he is saying, yes, there is probable cause to hold him. That's --   that's what's happening; is that right?              Thank you.             Suppose you were to say that where the State arrests an individual, brings him before a neutral official and intends and does impose a significant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of bringing that individual to trial, there is a presumption that that -- forget the presumption.              If that happens for the purpose, the primary purpose, primary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at that point the Sixth Amendment right attaches. Now, the State would not have to give him a lawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for example, as in Gouveia, keeping the prisons safe. For example, it's quite clear under the circumstances, there are 14 people accused, they couldn't have all have done it, they want to investigate further.   Or maybe there are other examples.            But, for the primary purpose, then the right attaches. So you pick up Gerstein and add to Gerstein that additional requirement.             What about that?   What harm would that cause?        What inconvenience would it cause, what difficulties, et cetera?             And you couldn't -- you couldn't because of the fact that bail -- if you're going to insist on bail, that in effect is incarceration.    But the reason I asked the question, which I would ask you the same, is there are a lot of States, we're told, that do have counsel attach in circumstances similar to this. So they must have some way of dealing with the problem that I raised if it's really a problem.               And I want to -- and that's -- and I want to -- if we're going into this, I think I need to know how this is dealt with.             You see, you would have given him a counsel.       I mean, in fact, if he had wanted one, Texas would give him one.               So Texas must have -- it must not be a problem.        The problem, I just --             Yes.             So the problem I raise can't be a real problem.
07-455 +++$+++                  Why should we agree with that?              That's exactly what's bothering me.   The issue in this case doesn't seem to me to be these weird hypotheticals.               Of course it requires a relationship, in my mind. But I don't see why the relationship couldn't be exactly the one Justice Alito was talking about.   I mean, imagine a person has a packed car filled with explosives.   He's going to blow something up.               A policemen comes up; he shoots the policeman.                The reason he shot the policeman was because he had his car packed with explosives. And if this -- if this provision -- I mean, I can't understand why this provision wouldn't be aimed directly at that kind of thing.              All right.      Suppose I don't agree with you about that -              That may be, but I don't You could say that. know -- but you could say that. But the problem is I have to answer the question -- I have to reach an answer that I believe should be sensible.              So what should I do -              -- if I think that shooting the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal filled with explosives is within this statute?              And similarly, lying to a customs officer so he won't catch me when my car is filled with explosives is within the statute? Suppose I believe that, but I also think the statute is not meant to govern those odd hypotheticals that you come up with?       There has to be a relationship, but the one I described falls within the word "relationship." Now what do I do?               I understand that argument. But suppose I don't accept the argument?                Then what do I do in this case?   That's what I'm asking.
07-463 +++$+++              The problem they are asking you on this -- it was at least a problem for me            -- I think it's tough on rightness is because the government is saying here:   Look, you want to challenge it outside the context of a particular action that you don't like. Well, there's never going to be an action, never going to be such an action that we are going to take that you won't find out about, that you will not be able to challenge in that context if you are really hurt.            There isn't one.   You can't name one that's ever been or imagine one that ever will be, okay? Now, is that so?              You see where they are going next.     And if you -- suppose that the thing you just told me, too, has problems or suppose it's pretty hard to find one, then the -- why this has never been decided and why it's difficult.                Because I would start with Abbott Labs and say there are three considerations. How easy is it now to solve the legal problem?               Here? Perfectly easy.     Nothing's going to change. Factor two, how likely is it that they will work with this legal rule and change it around here? Zero. But three, what kind of harm is it going to cause to the plaintiff if you were to deny him relief now?    And they are saying here that's also zero or next to zero.    So what do you do if the factor that cuts one way is zero and the factor that cuts the other way is zero, or near zero? Now, I have to admit I have never seen a case on that.     I don't know if there has been one before, and I don't know exactly what to do.               And if you can go read the appendix, maybe I can escape the zero.              Can I go back to standing for a minute.              You may have looked this up and may have found something here. Suppose an organization that has a purely ideological interest, so it can't get into Federal court, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are not going to get into Federal court.                      Now, suppose that agency then has a reg that they think is lawful and makes their life more difficult.                 I guess that the fact that they suffer a procedural injury would not get them into court.     They are already somebody who doesn't; they don't.   So I can imagine cases saying that. Contrast that with the case with a person who has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible allergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that there is too much chemical X, and now they are before an agency and they frequently complain about chemical X, but they don't have a particular case, but they will often be there.     Now, the agency promulgates a procedural regulation that hurts those people who normally have a concrete injury.                 All right?   There I wonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as a basis for standing. Now, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting the two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found in the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the first kind; and you are free to answer this as one word "nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair comment. (Laughter.)                 You think you are like the second?
07-474 +++$+++                Well, you think the answer is yes, I mean, because --               -- because the Administrative Procedures Act forbids arbitrary, capricious action.      So you're saying the Constitution --               -- does not constitutionalize all --             -- arbitrary, capricious behavior --             -- of the Federal Government --             -- or the State government.             Yes.             So the answer is yes. Okay.             Ma'am, the reason that we didn't say that same thing in Oleck is because in the taxation area or the easement area we simply don't have the great number of cases and also because animus is more easily established.             Well, I wondered if I was right, you know; that I thought that maybe, looking back, that there is something about zoning and taxation where it normally is alleged that it's rule-making activity. And that perhaps you would apply all of these things you are talking about where what the -- even if it is employment, where what the employer is doing, or anyone else is doing, is creating rules, is classifying.    And not a made-up classification like you put me and one other fired person in the fired- person category.   I don't mean that.              I mean like taxation and zoning and legislation.          Is there anything to that?
07-499 +++$+++               Why not any statute?    I'm mean, starting where Justice Kennedy left off, you said a hundred years.     It's thousands of years.             You could go back into the history of the human race --             -- and you will discover, of course, that your word "involuntary" is never something where the action is involuntary that we praise or blame people.    Rather, every action where we praise or blame people must be a voluntary action.                     The classic example is:    "The wind blew my arm."                   Now, you are saying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind, that this statute prevents him having asylum in the United States or having -- you know, withholding.                       How could one assume that involuntary actions are covered by this statute -- are not covered?             Are covered.             All right.          Then once you say that, then let's talk about intentional actions.             And are you going to have intentional actions?             Because praise or blame typically involves a voluntary action, an intentional action, and an action where there is a degree of freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too skewed.     And we see that in the criminal law by a reading into statutes that say nothing of the word "intentional," and by the use of the duress defense. Now what reason do we have for thinking that Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?              Oh, but Aristotle doesn't say criminal law.     He says praise or blame.              That's absolutely right. But do you think Congress intended that this absolute bar should apply where the person is in no sense blameworthy?               People use that word "intent" in the course of the human race to encompass the notion of duress.      I mean, that's -- that's sometimes done, sometimes not.              They are part and parcel of the same thing, which is whether you can blame the person for what he did.               In criminal law they were not, I agree --               -- because that's -- because we've seen the need for specificity.             But the question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a person responsible morally into the statute?
07-512 +++$+++                So can we write this following, we say:      In the district court, as of this moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit. There is a complaint that alleges a price theory under Brooke -- a predatory pricing under Brooke Group.                 That is what is there.     Nothing else is there.              Therefore, that issue which the Ninth Circuit decided has no bearing on this case.       We therefore vacate their decision, leaving it up to the district court to proceed as it believes appropriate under the law with the Brooke Group claim?                Is that a possible thing to say?                Yes or no, please.                Is it, yes, we could do that, or no --                Yes we can?                Isn't it --                -- that --              If we vacate, you would be in favor of vacating their decision?                 So why couldn't you -- why wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other regulator and say:      Regulator, they are selling me this widget or line at a dollar.              All right.        That's considerably higher than their costs of producing it. And, in addition to that, they sell the same service I do for $1.20, even though it costs me or would cost any human being at least 60 cents to provide that added service.   So we are asking you to tell them that if they continue to sell it at $1.20, they lower their wholesale price to us so that we only have to pay at most 80 cents, or whatever the right number is there. I mean, they have someone to complain to. They could make the same complaint.                      I'm quite surprised that Vickers has written that under the circumstances I have outlined that there is a valid price squeeze antitrust claim or that the British Commission has held that. I would be very interested to know the citation of that.    Because he may have done.                   I don't read everything.             I am saying the British Monopolies or Restricted Practices Commission of which Vickers was the head.       I agree with you that he is very knowledgeable, but I would be surprised if he had written contrary to what I just said in that example. But I am often surprised and willing to read it.
07-513 +++$+++              There is one question I have in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of hypothetically that cuts against you.                   This is the argument and I'd like you to respond to it. I take everything you said as so.                  I'll assume all that.     And so I'd still say the rule, the basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes:                  If the constable blunders, you suppress the evidence.                     Okay. Now, our prior case -- here we have a case where the constable blundered.                I grant you, not the arresting officer.      It was a different policeman, and it was a different form of error.                But five months this thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months earlier and you agree that it was negligent.                 Therefore, the constable blundered.           And the virtue of our earlier case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the constable who blundered.           So I see an absolutely clear line:   If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's somebody else who blundered, you don't. Now, every time I've tried to think of a substitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble. I've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks and we've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find one decent substitute that isn't filled with problems.                What is your substitute?              Right.           Well, I'm overstating my point.       What I'm really driving at and trying to show you is you, if you want to have a different rule than within the prior case, remember the one where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have to come up with some rule.           And I want to know what your rule is.              So now we have -- let's think about that.    The special rule is now we have the Leon exception and now we have a new exception, and the new exception is called for isolated police clerical errors.    Well, that's going to be interesting, I suspect. The first thing you'll have when you try to impose your rule is you will have the defense attorneys throughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated error.     And they will, of course, have a right to decide whether or not this is the only such error, whether there are other clerical errors, how often they occur, what the -- is that an administrable rule?              One other question. Suppose that the error here consisted not of a computer, but rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner called Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith, when negligently it wasn't Harry Smith?                 It was Joe Smith.              Well, I mean does that count as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man's partner who tells him this negligently?              Negligent.       It's Negligent police work.              That's negligent error. You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the partners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over here, and through negligence they have got the wrong man?   We don't suppress?              There must be millions -- not millions, but there must have been cases where two policemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone and negligently arrests the wrong man.                   And when he does that and does a search, we don't suppress.              That's Leon.        I'm not thinking that.              I'm not thinking of a warrant.    I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant for Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because through negligence he went to the wrong house.                  Now, under those circumstances would we suppress the drugs that happen to be found in Jack's house.              Well, there must have been a lot of cases.              But what about the lower courts?    What have they done?
07-526 +++$+++                I'm not sure he was, because when I looked through that whole thing it seemed to me what they were worried about -- Senator Thomas was worried about remnants of tribes, and they were talking about an example of the Catawba Indians in South Carolina, and they had a discussion about that; and then it seemed everybody on the committee agreed that these Catawba Indians should not be included if they were only one quarter Indian.      They should be included if they were half Indian.     And that meant that they had to fall within the other phrase, not the phrase that we are talking about. So then they say how do we get this result? I mean, because they are a tribe.                 Because they are certainly a tribe and they are recognized, the Catawbas. And then the answer to that was -- what's his name -- the Collier -- Collier.         Collier says:            I'll tell you how:   We add the words "now under Federal jurisdiction." And he thought what he was doing was ruling out the Catawbas and only allowing the half Indians to come in. Now, ironically, later on, in the '40s I think, the government decides that the Catawba tribe is in fact under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because a treaty exists. Anyway, that's how I read it and the California Indians were quite secondary to what they were talking about.      They didn't -- they didn't know whether they were under a tribe or not a tribe or anything.              I thought it was fairly clear.              Yes, but they -- I mean, Senator Wheeler was worried about the Catawbas.                     Then Wheeler decides, okay, the half-Indian Catawbas fall in, but the quarter-Indian Catawbas don't.              I'll go back to it.              You learn a lot at hearings, actually.                What do I do about --                What do I do about the fact -- I was looking this up -- Collier and Felix Cohn, the world's authority on Indian law, both write at the time: this means under Federal jurisdiction in 1934; and they write it and they rewrite it and they rewrite it.                 They say nothing to the contrary. I mean, they are the ones who did it, so I have to admit I'm pretty much moved by the fact that they thought that's what it meant.                 I could only find one instance, which is that Biloxi tribe, where the -- something, you know, the ones in Louisiana -- aside from that instance, I have not found one other instance that is inconsistent with the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" meaning Federal jurisdiction in 1934.                 If you want to list them, I'll look them up.             I believe that's organized or recognized, because what they did in several cases, I found, like the one, the Stillaquamish or whatever, they said, yes, we recognize them now.                 They weren't recognized in 1934, but they were under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because there were treaties that applied between the Federal Government and the Indians which gave these Indians rights then.                    And that -- that seems consistent with what -- what Collier and the others say.                I wouldn't know that that's so, because the -- the question I ask myself on that is: Were I in Congress, is this the kind of thing I would have delegated to the Secretary to decide. And it's very hard for me to think that Congress wanted to delegate the power to the Secretary to decide whether "now" happens to mean 1934 or "now" means any time in the future.               Well, I mean that's something Congress would decide:                 They meant by "now" 1934, or they meant by "now" any old time it's applied. Now -- now, you could argue that both ways, but why would you want to delegate?                       What human being would want to say:      The meaning of the word "now" is something I'm leaving to the Secretary?                 I'm not -- I'm not saying it unambiguously means it.            That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying it's totally ambiguous, but what the Secretary has to say about it is enlightening only insofar as the Secretary knows more about it than I. That's fine.   But not insofar as it delegates power to the Secretary to make up his own mind.               I have difficulty with the "tribe" thing.   I think it's a very difficult case.                    I have a hard time.    But the difficulty with the word "tribe" is that either that tribe has some people in it who are Indians, or it doesn't, right?                   That has to be true. Now, if it has some people in it who are Indians, i.e., a person who falls within the definition of "Indian," then, of course, the Secretary can take land for that because the whole thing is for the purpose of giving land to Indians.                      But let's imagine a tribe that has no Indians in it within the definition of the Act.   You are saying that this Act would give to the Secretary the power to take land for an entity that has no members within the Act.           Now, that is pretty hard for me to accept.             Well, there is one thing. It says it's for the purpose.              We -- we give the Secretary the power to take land for a tribe for the purpose of giving land to Indians.             And now we have assumed a tribe that has no such members because "Indian" has a special definition.             Then Collier, himself, would have been wrong.       Because Collier in this great famous colloquy says, when he adds these four words, he says to the Committee:       That would limit the Act to the Indians -- the Act would be limited to the Indians now under Federal jurisdiction except that other Indians of more than one-half Indian blood would get help. So what he is thinking in his mind is if you have any kind of entity or a person who is more than one-half Indian blood, fine.            The Secretary can act. But suppose we have an entity that has only people who have less than one-half Indian blood.                   Then they are out of luck unless they are now under Federal jurisdiction.
07-542 +++$+++              I -- I mean I don't know if it can go off on that.        The -- it seems to me I -- I thought when I looked through this, which was quickly, it seemed to me everyone was assuming that it's contemporaneous.    Of course, if it isn't contemporaneous, that's a new world, and maybe you would win on that.    I don't know.           But don't we have to for present purposes take it as a contemporaneous search, which I think is what the lower courts found?             Well, I'm sure there are, but what is your opinion?           I mean, is there some reason what I have been doing -- you can tell me -- I am finding this case very, very difficult.                  And I am not at all certain in my own mind, and I am being quite frank with you.   And the reason is that although I don't think Belton is very logical, it has been the law for 27 years; and I take they seriously, as we all do, the principle of stare decisus. That is why your response to Justice Alito really sort of shook me.          Because I was thinking, one, I have to take this as contemporaneous; and I have to run squarely into the problem that for some period of years Belton has been the law and maybe even before Belton.                      I don't know about Thomas Jefferson's automobile.                     But, nonetheless, no disaster has occurred, and so why would we overrule an earlier case? Now that's -- that's exactly my problem. And so if you were interested in that, you have to give me an answer.                 Well are you saying do you have any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I think that the stare decisus is really brought into play when you think the earlier decision was wrong.              And at that point I'd still need a reason why you should depart from that earlier decision at the moment what the other side says is we tell our police a simple thing.             We tell them when you arrest somebody who is in a car you can search the passenger compartment of the car okay.                  Simple.   And we've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do that and they do it.     Now, is there some indication that that's turned out to be abusive?              Is there indication that there are other problems with the rule as it turned out to be complicated?      What kinds of things you could say that will overcome what I'm putting forth as a kind of reluctance.
07-543 +++$+++              I take it you are not saying anything that is in effect and is still there, you do retro, you win.       I take it -- maybe I am not right, but I take it that what -- what the point is here is that you -- you took a complicated superstructure of rules that was creating boxes and those boxes were created on the basis of discrimination.                  Then you move it, whole cloth, into the post-new world.                  And it's the administration of that complicated system of rules that was created out of the discrimination, but it's administration today that makes it like Bazemore.                It does that, but what I can't figure out is does that have a lot of implication for other areas or not?          And the other thing I'm not sure of is how it squares with Ledbetter.
07-5439 +++$+++               You have to, I mean, I can't, I don't know if "substantial" is the right word to capture it.   Perhaps the right word is is there a significant risk that can be easily averted and what I'm worried about here is do we or do we not send it back, I'm quite honestly disturbed by the fact that in this -- I can't report they both recommend pancuronium and that the sodium thiopental doesn't work not even in grams of three doses in all cases but they think the contrary and if there is uncertainty here should we send it back for consideration of all these things in a more full hearing under a standard that does allow comparisons with other methods not to find a comparison not too fine a comparison but at least a practical comparison.
07-544 +++$+++              I agree with that.           And my question is going to be -- at some point, both of you seem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a harmless error standard of review.                  I think a wrote a case on that, which says that --             Right.           So why don't we just send it back and say apply the standard?               You're saying that I should have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to.                He made an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad one.   He said look at page 14 and you'll see the mistake, you know, in the joint appendix.               There it is.     And it's absolutely wrong.    The basic instruction under the law says you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to have a certain state of intent.              You have to have committed this murder in order to help the crime or at least in order to escape.               And that's wrong.           Put them together, but then look at the instruction on page 13, which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does seem to say that, or more so.             It says, you can only apply -- jury, you can only apply this special instruction if two things are true:                     First, in lines 9 through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that you have to be engaged in the crime.                    And then just before that, it says, and you have to have one of two states of mind.   You have to either intend to kill the person or at least be recklessly indifferent.                     And since that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much.                     That's one of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.              I'm sure that would be -- I mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among judges.   Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht.               I'd like it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me the O'Neal clause applies.              Just go do it.      And then they can say "we already did it," or they can say "we didn't already do it, but we'll do it now."                Let them say what they want to say.
07-552 +++$+++              Well I guess it could be that you're asking them to go back into records that are somewhat old.    What you're asking to find out is -- is every call made out of a payphone that was long distance call, and we don't even know who actually turned out to be the carrier.    It's like asking them, tell us exactly on the payphone at that corner over there who was called at 9:15 a.m. to some number in 1987, and maybe they should have records of that but they don't.                     They have estimates --                They say maybe the time necessary to go through those records, to figure out whether you should give 12 cents to the person who ran that payphone, is really not worth it.                And therefore, if they are right in some claim like that, is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC?              I mean, it -- it -- I don't think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under some set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to get the discovery that this just won't be worth it. Now that might be right.                      And if it is right or whether it's right, can the FCC work this out?                I'm aware of that system. I'm aware of that.                Right.           But my question is to get to that figure there may be billions of calls, for all I know.                And it could be quite expensive to track down each of those calls individually.   I don't know if it is or not; but if it is, is there a way to get this problem worked out at the FCC or do we have the cabbage case grown large?               In settlement they may work out.   But if it is -- for example costs a dollar to fight a claim that's worth 12 cents, individually, before you get to billions, they don't want to be in that situation where they are really paying money for nothing; because in their opinion they already paid. I mean we understand this kind of problem. So I go back to my question.              They have one view of it; you have another of what's going on here.                    And their view is very unfavorable to your clients and your clients' view is very unfavorable to their clients.                       So I would like to know is there a way to get this worked out at the FCC?    Maybe that will turn out not to be relevant in this case but I'd still like to know your opinion.              Do you -- this is giving me a thought here.   Just a total imaginary case, nothing to do with your clients.       Put yourself in the opposite position.   Suppose you were representing a defendant and that defendant were asked by this imaginary plaintiff to dig up records on the computer.               To dig up each individual record costs $1, there were billions of such records, and the value to you, to the other side, the plaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call. Okay?   So you say look, those people are asking us to dig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a dollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out of it is 12 cents a call.            But of course we are the ones who have to pay the dollar, and they get the 12 cents. Now, is there a way for the legal system to solve that problem?             Other than standing.                Well, the defendant says -- now your client, I am not going to settle; there are no such claims.    This is ridiculous but it's going to cost me a dollar to prove it.
07-562 +++$+++               Well, why couldn't you say exactly the same thing about a State mode seeks to protect consumers, and they have a -- they have a rule, and the rule is not only the cigarette company do you have to say cigarettes are dangerous to your health, you have to put skull and crossbones?                  That's the state law. And you say why?            They say because we are trying to protect consumers.              And then you would be up here saying, they are not trying -- the duty there is not the duty to put the skull and crossbones.                  It's the duty to protect consumers. Now, that argument would get nowhere, as you understand.    And they are saying you're making just that kind of argument here, except substitute the word "deception".             That's what I want you to get you to talk about just for me for 30 seconds.                        I can't deal with this conceptual thing.                      It was hard for me to see it conceptually.           I can't understand -- and that may be enough to any other person here, but I can't understand somebody saying yes, this language is very absolute but it doesn't mean to cover everything that it literally applies to.       For example, it probably doesn't cover a requirement about workers smoking who put up billboards.    And another thing you say it doesn't cover is traditional anti-deception law.                  That would have to do with the purpose of the statute not the text. I'm not making your argument for you.                      I'm giving you an introduction, and I want you to give 30 seconds dealing with the purposes that either says there is something to that line or there isn't.
07-581 +++$+++               Is also true -- is that also true with an ordinary tort or any other kind of suit?               A tort suit.      It says, some -- the union -- the same thing here, but we are not concerned with discrimination; we are concerned with workplace safety.     Somebody is hurt as a result of machine improperly functioning, or there isn't adequate notice or so forth.      Is your view the same there?               Why?               Doesn't this allow discrimination -- doesn't this refer to discrimination by the employer?                 Now, you say section 30 doesn't say anything about union discrimination particularly; it just talks about discrimination.                 Fine.       So you think sometimes unions do discriminate?                 All right.           And sometimes unions also would rather have the more effective machine or sometimes unions feel their workers are stupid not to read the machine label properly or -- I mean, I can replicate anything you might think.                       We can think of tort suits, the two of us, which could put unions and employees on opposite shores, just as we can think of discrimination suits.        Most unions don't want discrimination.     I mean, most of the time.                    And most unions don't want dangerous machines most of the time. So if I decide for you in this case, am I also saying that they can't arbitrate ordinary tort suits or contract suits or just whether or not the workplace which is made of wood is filled with termites? I mean, you know?                 That's the only reason? Because, in other words, if I think I see no more reason why a union today, whatever was true 40 years ago, that I see no more reason today why a union would like discrimination, then I can see a reason why they would like a dangerous machine?                 If I think that, then I should decide against you?             Very helpful of you.             Then I replicate my question because what I'm thinking is simply that there are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims that people go to arbitration over.                    And what I'm wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of such claims that I have now said that a union, through a collective bargaining contract, can force the employee against his will to go to arbitration over?                    I don't have a feeling for that from the briefs.                    I don't have a feeling that you want to say that discrimination claims are special in that regard, that there's no line in that regard, or that there's some other line.              Well, can you give me a hint as to the principle? (Laughter.)                 I -- I just want to be sure that at some point you answer this question, if you can. I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us, as I see it, is just what you said:                       When can a union require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a court case in an instance where the union member has not signed a special waiver?           That's the question, right? Okay. And what I think some of us were struggling for here is:   If we say yes to you they can force them, or no to you they can't, what's the principle? Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend to think they can force the worker into arbitration is where the right grows out of the collective bargaining agreement, period. Then we have what we were talking about with Justice Souter, a common law tort claim.                       Then we might have a State law giving a claim.                 Then we might have a Federal law like this one giving a claim. And we just heard -- I would assume if Justice Scalia thought of such a case, then the response                 That's why I am asking you for the principle.
07-582 +++$+++               And you were -- you were pursuing the practical thing about the tapes, and so forth, when you got on to a different subject, which was the -- the nature of the program.                I just wanted to be certain you are finished with what you wanted to say there.   I -- because I am interested in the practical question of:   Do all the stations have tapes?                 And leave sports events out of it, and leave news out of it.                  Are there other events that these small stations might want to cover that don't have the tape or that now don't use the tape; anything else you want to say about that?              I am interested in the practical problem as part of this.                 Where do I look to find out some facts?
07-588 +++$+++              I don't see how you can do that.   I just don't see it.            It's -- I mean, suppose that the cost of this machine is $100,000.                  Now, if you say I'm talking about using that machine for an entire industry, you would say, my God, that is certainly available.    But here I have just one part of the industry here; I have a little plant; and you know, to hook that machine up is only going to save one paramecium.    Neither of us wants that. And so the logical thing to say is to say well, it isn't available for that.                  And I would be with you there.             But to be honest about it, I would have to say the reason it isn't available is quite -- it isn't available for minimizing the -- the harm -- that particular adverse impact which is killing a -- a water animal.       The reason it isn't is because it doesn't kill any water animals.               Well, let me be honest; it kills one, or it kills two --              But what I'm trying to show here is that -- that there -- it isn't meaningful to talk about cost being available for an end, without some -- about something not being available for an end in light of its costs, unless you take into account what that end is.    I mean, we'd spend trillions to make America secure so not 50 thousand people die, but we won't spend trillions for a road accident.                    And -- and of course you take those things into account. So that's -- that's exactly the point I wonder about.   Are you really saying pay no attention or are you saying, which I could understand better, but you have to say what you want, I mean, that what we mean is, yes, they can take costs into account.                   That's what they do under the comparable standard, best available technology, but just use your head, don't do it too much, don't use it -- like take other things into account, too, don't do a formal cost-benefit analysis; don't try to evaluate the paramecium.                    Do the difference between the -- you know, the two standards:                    Best practical, best available.           Do "grossly" or "wholly" or something.                No, no, no, but best available says take costs into account.                Now, there is a way of doing that which is what I'd call a commonsense way that they have some discretion over, that doesn't involve some enormously elaborate thing; and that's what I am searching for.     I don't -- I am not sitting here with an answer.   I'm trying to find a way of making sense of this.                Those two things seem contrary to me.     I don't see how you could -- do you see why?             But how is it -- how is it feasible if it has no benefits at all?             Then we are going to reach our insane results.              Can't make any other judgment.     So imagine the consequence of that environmentally.     They can't make any other judgment. Suppose the EPA is right:            it's going to add 20 electric plants, huge plants, purely to save the fish; and the result is the cost of electricity goes up, and the result is there are no electric cars, because people make the comparison with oil, and now they have to have petrol.     I mean, it's very hard for me to believe that Senator Muskie would have written a statute that would have foreseen such an effect.              That's exactly where I agree with you.    So I go back to page 170 of the legislative history, which I have read now six times, and I agree with you that it is not totally clear. Maybe you think it is.         But it seems to me what he is saying there is just what you've said:                    Don't go into this with some elaborate thing, but remember costs are still relevant.    And what I've been searching for throughout is a set of words that would help me translate that thought into a legal reality.              Well, what about the particular case?    What they said here is that, if you require the closed circuit for everybody, we are going to have to build, we are going to have to pay an energy penalty of 2.4 to 5.3 percent.               You will have to build 20 additional 400-megawatt plants, which is huge, many, many, many billions of dollars, and the -- just to replace the capacity you have lost.                      And the result, which seems quite logical, would be to increase by a lot, not just a little, the consumption of fossil fuel. Well, now how are they not -- you seem to be arguing that they can't take that into account, which, for an environmental agency, I would have thought, "But they must take it into account."              So if they did exactly the same thing they've done, which I've just read you, and they put a label on it, instead of saying "thinking of benefits," we were calling it now "taking into account environmental impacts," then they could do it?              I see that thought, and this is what's concerning me, but there may be a very good answer.   A lot remains to be done with EPA.           They have an enormous job to do.            And I wouldn't want to get them tied up in unnecessary red tape, where everybody is suddenly taking them to court on rather technical things.   So if this "grossly" or "wholly," or whatever you call it, read out of the Muskie page 170 -- read it out of the "available technology" definition, you can take costs into account; just don't do it in this other way.   I can see how they could work with that.              Now, I'm worried about what you are saying that may make it so difficult for them that they won't be able to do the job.              I agree.              And the page -- the page of the legislative history or the page of the text of the statute that says what I think is a -- I mean, try it with your son.     It costs $100.              Your son says, "It costs $100."     You say, "That's too expensive."                       He says, "But I didn't tell you what it was for."                       What?    I mean -- you see? Now you tell me the page, and I have read a lot of it; tell me the page of the legislative history or the phrase of the statute where it says what you just said -- that you cannot take into account what you were buying for that $100.              What page?           I will read it again.              I know 316(b).
07-591 +++$+++              How can we administer something like that?       His point I think is, look, you can't make any distinction either of something that is evidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it wasn't.   And if it was prepared with an eye towards trial, well, then call the person and have him testify. That's it.    And if that encompasses every test under the sun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a reasonable line. You start talking about reliability and their amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how police labs or other labs have really been way off base and moreover really wrong.          And you say, oh, distinguish between a police lab and University of Massachusetts? Try going down that road of which one is reliable, which one isn't reliable.     How do we know?               That's his point.   No workable way to do it.       There can be horrors on both -- in both areas, and so follow what the history was where there was no history on this being admissible.               Aren't there some things I read in the paper all the time, about these laboratories in various places, and they lost the results, they got it all wrong?   That just doesn't happen?                Well, you make me think the public certificate.       Let's imagine birth and death records.   There is a whole building full of them; they are on microfiche.      Now, I am not sure how Massachusetts works, but I suppose if you want to introduce one you call up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up, produces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe written beneath it which says:                "This is a true copy of the," and you don't call in the keeper. Now that statement on a piece of paper, "this is a true copy of the birth certificate of John Smith," that was prepared specifically for this trial.                So I take it that has nothing -- I mean we'll find out, but if they win, every one of those cases, every document you have to bring in the person to make clear that the document that says that this is a copy of the document --              Is that what -- is that the point?                You're going to work either.   Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's accusers wanted to testify about something that was nontestimonial:     what happened on the day.             So what we are looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a very peculiar result that's going to have every public document in the United States suddenly have the keeper of that document having to come into court. On the other hand, I'm having a hard time figuring out what the distinction is between that and all these other things.
07-6053 +++$+++              The reason, I think, is -- I think, if I understand Justice Scalia's question, take ordinary hearsay?             Okay.       There's a reason for keeping it out, though there are many exceptions.                 Now take that subset of ordinary hearsay where it was a statement made purposefully to go to trial.                 Now there is especially good reason for keeping it out, so like a double reason.    And I think he finds it odd that we, under the common law, putting us back then, would say there's an exception where there's especially good reason for keeping it out, see, in the testimonial case, an exception where you go get the person murdered, but you didn't do it purposefully.               But -- but there is no exception in just where there's only the ordinary reason for keeping it out.      It should seem to work the other way around. Now, to me that suggests that maybe we shouldn't follow completely the common law as it evolved in evidentiary principles.           Maybe we have to assume an intent to allow the contours of the Confrontation Clause to evolve as the law of evidence itself evolves. Otherwise, we get caught up in these logical contradictions.    What do you think of that?             Do you see what my question was?   My question is the same question I asked your fellow counsel.   My question is, since I led you to the point where you were willing to say maybe there is some flexibility here, what?         That's where I'm having the trouble.   What precisely are the principles I should follow to prevent my going back to look at they dunked witches, but allowing the heart of Crawford to be maintained.    How do I do it? I don't know if you can answer that question, but that's the problem that I'm having.              I would think these cases come in -- this problem comes in with spousal abuse. Now, I don't know what the numbers are, but I bet you could find numbers.       I suspect, but I don't know, that in many cases where there's a death in that kind of situation, maybe it is accidental.                   Maybe the -- maybe the man who is beating up his wife didn't really want her to die.              All right.        So that to me, I guess, suggests that that's in favor of your rule, I think.   Isn't it?              And so that would be true, whether it was intended or whether it isn't intended.             Whether it's -- I mean, I'm not sure how to even administer even a criminal/civil distinction.
07-608 +++$+++              As I read this old one -- as I read the first one, Senator Lautenberg put in the language, and his language in the first one was to say I'll tell you a group of people who shouldn't have guns. The people who commit a crime of domestic violence. Now what's that?               In the statute he says it is a misdemeanor crime of violence committed by a person in a family relation with the victim. Then he says after, I changed that language a little.   I'll tell you why.               Because somebody told me misdemeanor crime of violence is too broad.                     It could include cutting up a credit card.                   So I'll define it more specifically. And he defines if more specifically to say that it is a crime that has as an element the use or attempted use of physical force or threatening people with a weapon.      End of the matter. They substitute those words and they did another thing the drafter as he breaks out the thing it says:   It is a crime that is a misdemeanor and, you see, and that's where the problem is, because if you put in a "that," then you have to have an "is."                     So he left out the "is."   Okay. So I say what did Senator Lautenberg want with these words?      I see.         How did he change it?          I see. I can't find a word that supports the reason that you have.      Now, maybe they are there.                 That's what you'll tell me. And then I say it's the fine language consistent with what he wanted.               It requires putting in an "is."   I don't find that too awful.                   Okay.    That's your argument against you.           What is it?           Your argument to rebut that.             That's the conclusion. You're reaching that conclusion.                What I need from you is something that would tell me, no, Congress didn't just want to clarify in the way Lautenberg said.                     What they wanted to do was, in fact, restrict the scope of this so it only applied in 17 states.                    Okay.    I'm open to that argument.    It could be a good argument.                   Just point me to the things that suggest that that is what Congress wanted to do, rather than by what Senator Lautenberg said.               No, I've got the words.           If the best you can do is point me to the words of the statute, I'll take that into account.                   I'm asking the question to see if there is anything at all more?               I don't want the text.        I want something for my purposes.               Okay.              I'm sorry.       Are you saying that Senator Lautenberg did not change the words "misdemeanor crime of violence" to the words "use of physical force" or "threatened use of deadly weapon"? That's what he got up on the floor of the Senate and said that he wanted to change.              I'm not -- we're in -- the question specifically is where did the words come from? I thought that the words came from Senator Lautenberg. The reason I thought that is because he got up on the floor of the Senate and said that's what he did. Now, if you're telling me they came from a different place, what is there in anywhere?             I'm open to hearing it, but I couldn't find anything that said they had come from a different place.              So the -- the -- the language on physical force came from the House?               That's what you're saying?     I'm just trying to be clear.               It might have.     I'm not criticizing.   I want to know.               Making progress.    And you're saying that in the House there were some people who didn't want it to extend to beyond 17 States?               And how do we know that?
07-610 +++$+++               Is there a rule or a reg somewhere in the Labor Department that says if the national union takes its money from its local, spends it in a way that has nothing to do with politics whatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build too big a building, or they do something that doesn't benefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?             There is no remedy at all.             So union members who are being gypped, they just have to put up with it.             Right.           Are you saying you could bring a lawsuit or not?             So either -- in these cases everybody in the union whether they're forced or not, has this kind of remedy or nobody does?                      That's your --
07-615 +++$+++              Right.           So what is the -- it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either way.   Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars. And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account or buys the grocery store.           All right?             Now suppose that happened. It makes it simpler.       And then what happens is three people, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't accept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground Iran owes us this money.             We want the grocery store. And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what you owe us.    But if we get the money, then you can subtract it.    That's their view. The United States' view is different.                 Who will resolve that question?           The tribunal.        So they say, what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what is at issue is the question of whether we get the money or you get the money.      What money?             The money that is the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in which case it's identical. Now I think in that situation it's easy for me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank account, of course is at issue before the tribunal.                For the question is, does Iran get it or does the United States get it, in the situation where the two other people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it.                I can easily read it that way.           I can also read it the way you want.             All right?       So now, which do I do? (Laughter.)             All right.       I'll then add that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me, is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate victims of terrorism.        That's a worthy goal, and that's one of the points.      But it was to compensate them consistent with the proper running, in the interests of the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims Tribunal. And so this is just the kind of issue we don't want to simply take away and let the victim have, because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule against us, and we will have to pay it twice.                  Okay. That's the argument against you. Now, what's the argument for you?                Yes.                That's one, but --             That creates the issue, because the question is whether money that never goes back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is money that is or money that is not subtracted from the amount that the United States owes Iran.             And that question is the question --             -- is the question that is before the commission.              They are totally knowable. They are totally knowable.          In order to decide what they are all you have to do is to look at the issues before the commission and decide whether those issues concern specific, concrete property; that is, the property that you have an interest in. With my grocery store, with my bank account, and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran has put before the commission the question of whether if you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get it, or we do get it.              That's what I gather.     Now you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.              They are trying to attach the ACMR system.              They are trying to attach the Cubic judgment.     The ACMR judgment is in Canada.              And that's one piece of property.   The other piece of property that is at issue is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before the tribunal as well. That's my understanding at the moment, and I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.              Well, the -- the other thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that Iran didn't get.     And because they didn't get it, all kinds of things happened with property, and you get more of it or you get less of it.              And during the interim years all kinds of things happened. And it could be that those transformations at different times are directly before the tribunal, irrespective to how much damages you are going to get, and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have three or four hours.        But you see where I am going?              Now, I can understand Congress in passing this statute having one of two possible things:     One is say we are just going to cut an arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit within this.    That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a compromise.              The other way to look at it is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we will pay these victims something; you know, they are going to get something right from Congress right now, because they are hurt.         But in return from that, we don't want you taking action that will really affect our liability to Iran.      And if it's the second, then we needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.
07-636 +++$+++              Well, could we do this?        I mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a very strong argument following the plan documents.                 They have had some chance to reply to it, but not a full chance.   It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit had -- would probably know what they say.                Okay.   Can we, say, grant the question now and ask that people file an additional brief if they want to say something? It just seems to me an awful waste of money and everybody's time to send it back and have it make another trip.    So what's your suggestion as to how we proceed?              You see, I want to be fair to them.    I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the other side to be sure they have a chance to say everything they have to say.             That's what's worrying me.              Well, that doesn't make too much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just waived.     The wife waived the amount because when she waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody.                       She just doesn't take it.        So it goes to the beneficiary -- it goes to the person who made up the plan.                     It's a little hard to pay to him, because he is dead. So I mean if you read it literally, it doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case before us, which is a case of waiver.                     And of course the argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law, waiver is treated differently.                And if it weren't, you'd have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a benefit that's given to you by someone else. And so let's interpret this and make sense of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest of the law to say a waiver is waivered.                    It's not giving something to somebody else.                 The argument is against you and I would like to hear what you have to say.               I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd have to admit.     I think -- and you perhaps can explain it to me -- but, I thought the things that you are quoting are QDRO is about an effort to alienate some property that would otherwise go to the person who was setting up a QDRO, in other words, the wife here, in other words Liv here; is that right?               Okay.       The one person who couldn't be an alternate payee is the payor.                   And so, in fact, when you waive something, it isn't that it necessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it didn't here.     It simply went back to the payor.                And so the language of this prevision you're quoting just doesn't deal with this case.               I know you do, and that's what I need to ask.               I'm sorry.       It says, if it's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.             Now, you think that includes the giver, the payor?             Well, that's where this goes if you waive it.               I'm five minutes behind.            I just got your point on the (iii)(1).                    I see it.               Okay?       I get it.             Let me go back for a second because, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it right, I still don't see why Congress would have done it literally. I think what you're saying is:                   "Read the full four pages.    What those four pages say are, Judge, you have an order, a divorce decree.                     It's defined as an order.   Look at it.     It's qualified or it isn't.                 If it's qualified, pay the money to the person it names. If it's not qualified, pay the money to the person, namely Liv, who would have been entitled to the amount if there had been no order." Okay.    You read that literally as you want and what it says is:      "Liv, you're being divorced.             You want a divorce; your husband wants a divorce; you're going to be divorced.      You cannot waive the benefit under the plan."   Now, why would Congress not want her to be able to waive it?        Why?               I can understand an anti- alienation provision.      That's some guy who is going to come along and grab this money when you want to take care of a widow, and you want to take care -- but -- but this isn't that.   It's just -- she just wants to waive it; she doesn't want it.         That's the widow herself. Okay, so why would Congress --                 I see.              Is the -- is the wife -- I'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too.                      If your -- the woman is Wife X, and her ex has a pension. Doesn't something vest there?               She is in California. Doesn't she have some vested right to some of that pension?              Suppose she's married for 40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and then he wants a divorce.           Doesn't she have some right to some of that money.              Does she get some of the money he saved?              So it's not exactly that you could have just changed the beneficiary.                   If you just changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her something else.              But in the divorce proceeding she's going to get some of the money, which is now just the inverse point, to which she is entitled. So obviously she will get something, but she's entitled to it.
07-665 +++$+++               What do we do -- is this monument suspiciously similar to the one in Texas?               And so if the history is the same, you would know that there was -- a big element of this was Cecile B. DeMille trying to promote his movie, The Ten Commandments.               So he gave money to the Eagles, and the Eagles put Ten Commandments all over because it would be good for the morality of people, and also it would help promote the movie.    All right?      Is that true -- is that the actual description here?                 Okay.                 So -- so if that's the history of it, what does that mean?                         I mean, where do we go with that?   Then this is in fact partly an attempt to promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly an attempt to promote a movie.                  So, what do we do with that?                 Why not?          Why not?   Why -- suppose that there -- there are certain messages that private people had like "eat vitamins" --                 -- and so they say -- you know, whatever those are; and then somebody comes along with a totally different content, "ride the roller coaster," and they say this part of the park is designed to get healthy children, not put children at risk.               So therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't want messages, "ride the roller coaster."               This is all private.   It's the -- you know -- now what?              So in other words, they -- the --              They can't do either.              Is there any case that says -- can they have playgrounds in the park?              Okay, so we have right in the playground, we have "eat vitamins," "eat your -- clean up all your -- all the food in your plate," "don't throw food at your brother," okay? So -- I mean --              Yes, all private.                -- whatever.     So -- so what's wrong with that?         Where does the First Amendment forbid that?    You promote -- they want in this corner, promoting in the playground good things that they like and not bad ones.    Where does it permit it?             What's the case that says that the Government couldn't do that?                Give one and I'll read it. Give me three; I'll read them.                But the children's playground isn't the public forum.              I see where you're going. Thank you.
07-689 +++$+++               I don't see how those claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go back to sort of step 1.       My mind turns a little confused when I start thinking of these cases.                  Are we talking about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote dilution?    Is that yes or no?              Section 2 -- does vote dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a black group, could have elected a candidate of our choice more likely than the white group, but because you are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen anymore?    Is that the form of the claim?              That's the form of the claim. Then, it's our problem here that to see whether that's so, you have to see whether the black group did really vote as a group.                 Did they used to have a good chance to elect the person they want, and does the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp them?    Is that what we are trying to find out?              There are a lot of reasons that can happen.    But is the evil we are trying to get at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting their candidate elected than when the white group does the same?                That's what we are trying to prevent?    Okay.      If that's what we are trying to prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you can't even get in the door -- unless the black group accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense for the reason that Justice Scalia started with.               It doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because they all divide on four different people, or maybe they didn't turn out.    On the other hand, sometimes if they account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate of their choice.    So it looks as if that 50 percent is pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better criterion.    Is there anything wrong with what I've said so far?              Here what we've -- could we look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough to elect the candidates of their choice?                 Reasonably compact, politically cohesive?             And then you look to see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop them?              That's what we should do?              Then I'm back to my problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just doesn't measure that first part.              And so you say, well, any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could invent some that were actually better.                 Suppose you wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example, you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said, you know, if the black group is going to elect their candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out.                 They are going to need a lot of crossovers.                     And the more crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say that that white group is out there trying to beat them. So there's a kind of natural stopping place. When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.                     It sort of fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist that the black group had to be twice as many as the white group that crossed over.              A little arbitrary, but at least we were getting to the same -- to the right thing.   I mean -- respond as you wish.               If you want an absolute, arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward which will just -- - the question is whether they get in the door.     If they are in the door, they have to prove the three factors.       And you want to keep certain people out. Okay.    Suppose you say, well, 42 percent. That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead of 50.     But you are out anyway if the crossover vote from the white majority is more than half of what the whole vote is with the black and white together on that side.     So you have a two-to-one ratio. Now, the only virtue of that is that there was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is likely to get in more cases that are justified.              But they still have to prove their three factors.              It takes into account the realistic fact that in every group, including lots of African-American groups, there is -- it is not 100 percent African American at all.                   There are -- there are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's still the candidate of that community's choice.              So we want -- a little flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.              You can't get below 42. I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with your thumb on the scale.              They are -- they are finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.
07-6984 +++$+++               Why -- why is it a strain? I mean suppose that Texas decided to give every criminal defendant convicted one thousand years to appeal.                      You know, if they did, I guess they would have one more year after that to go to Federal habeas, right?              Okay.       Then what's the difference between that, giving them a thousand years, which I doubt they will do, and what they have said here?     They said for purposes of the Texas rules all time limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had been imposed on the date that the mandate of this court issues. There they are.            The Texas Supreme Court gave him all that time, it's whatever it was, and said that's the time you have.            How, how is that different from the legislature decides to give him one thousand years?                But it works.             Your system, I think, works in that instance, as I understand it. Don't tell me I'm right if I'm wrong, please.                         But the -- as you understand it, he finishes -- he doesn't get his appeal, you know, and time passes; doesn't take it. Then, five years later, he learns for the first time and the first time he could have learned that his lawyer tore up the notification.            At that point, (1)(B) comes into play.    So the year begins to run. Then, in your idea, he has -- he has a year to go to Federal court.          But wait, it's tolled while he goes to State court.        So he goes to State court having just learned it.     And now he's under (2) and he files a habeas in State.     Now the remedy of the State habeas is to reopen the direct appeal.              But we should count that, since it's a remedy of a habeas, as if it were a continuation of the habeas and therefore it would fall within (2).    That's your argument.              And it's -- correct?   I do not think there is any case ever considered that to my knowledge.              -- and the only difficulty of it is that you have to take a sort of leap of faith of some kind in attaching what everybody's calling the direct appeal as if it were actually part of the State habeas proceeding.      That's I think the hardest part of your argument.                 (D).                 It's not (B), it's (D).                 (D).              But I think it's a good point.             Between your response to the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, I stand enlightened.
07-751 +++$+++                Imagining -- you are imagining different cases.           We can imagine a spectrum of cases.   In some cases the policeman or the confidential informant will be there, and he really couldn't have gotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance. It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on him and kill him.    Okay? So there are a lot of cases just like this one, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to call the police, and there will be others where he doesn't. So that's why I am so uncertain about what it is we are deciding here on the merits.                     We would have to say on the merits this is a case where there are no exigent circumstances.         Can we say that?              I -- would not want to "never are there."
07-77 +++$+++               Well, is it?      Because -- I mean, what they're saying is let's use a little common sense here.    And you look at Fordice and there it was an instance where it just didn't take effect at all as a practical matter. And then we cited those two cases you're talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion -- there was a ward system that was in fact in force or effect.   But I don't know how long that ward system was in effect.    It might have been for a long time, and people might have taken action under it. And the same thing is true in City of Lockhart.    I can't tell.        You may know.          But my point is they are saying:    Here we have a middle case, and what we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't really in effect.    People challenged it the minute they could.   They -- everybody knew it was unconstitutional, or a lot of people believed it.               And the Governor then did something to make up for it. If you're going to say that that little bit counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what we're going to have?       We're going to have every municipality all over the country that doesn't always know what the rules are, and they pass something, and people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong, and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law. That's going to be a mess. They're saying something like that, so I'd like to hear your response.              Well, Young versus Fordice, that's Young versus -- I mean, if it never went into force and effect, of course we don't reach questions like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors and so forth.    And so I think it's an important matter. And as I read Fordice, we have over here an instance where nothing happened.          You know, some people registered and then immediately they were told the registration was no good.            So it wasn't in force and effect. When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that was not a case where the law was challenged immediately. Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they had an election under the ward system.                    So even if it might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still in effect for three years. In the other case, City of Lockhart, Justice Powell says this statute has been in effect, we assume, from 1917 to 1973.      That's not exactly a fleeting matter.   So -- so here we have a case where they challenged it instantly, where it was litigated as fast as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice Ginsburg just said, a different decision of the circuit court would have led to the opposite of it never would have even had it.     So what harm does it do to the enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United States if the holding of this Court were, well, under these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et cetera, it never took force and effect?
07-772 +++$+++                 That's exactly what the instruction said.    My problem is, I guess different people, I understand, can read the same words and come to different conclusions.           But I have read the instruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times by now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity. It seems to be absolutely clear.                 What it says is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I would say what crime is the jury considering -- of a crime.     Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is committed by another person for which he is legally accountable. Then it says you're an accomplice -- an accomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with certain knowledge when he aids another person in planning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree murder. What is the problem?              That's a different argument.    I want to know first -- in my mind in two different categories.        Category one:                Is there an ambiguity in this instruction?                And my answer so far, which is what I was asking you, is zero.                      Why not? And then the second question is, could the prosecution get people so mixed up about something, a typical thing like this, that it would violate due process?    That's why I asked the question before.                      And I said, obviously the answer is sometimes they could. And then the question is, did they here? And what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked at, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in that case did not rise to a federal due process question.     So, I guess -- though it's only one person -- you would have to convince me that this is somehow worse prosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.              All my questions from the whole case.              No.     But what I mean by that is that the prosecution would have had to have gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using shorthand for that --              -- more mixed up than they did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.              In my -- it it doesn't mean either.   It means jury you are instructed that the person is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury is sitting there and they are asked the question:                   Is the person guilty of second-degree murder? Now they are to apply the instruction.                   A person is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da, da.   And when it gets to "the crime", it is referring to second-degree murder.      I don't know how -- anything else it could be referring to.               You're convincing me that different people can reach different conclusions.                     What I'd like you to say is something that would change my mind on my initial conclusion that there is no ambiguity.   I think you could say something like that, because as you quite rightly point out, other people have reached other conclusions.              So, then, what I take is authoritative on that are two sentences from the Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other judges have been all over the lot.                   The first sentence it says:     The trial court correctly instructed the jury that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it found he knowingly aided in commission of "the crime" charged, which was second-degree murder.                   That's their interpretation, which I could understand. Then the second thing is, it does not offend the principles of accomplice liability to hold responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely, conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when the substantial risk of death results in actual death. So that would seem to be hornbook law.              If you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's the Washington view, that's it.                You've had it. And here they go on to say that he knew there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was engaged in a drive-by shooting.                And then to put every dot on every "I", they say a drive-by shooting does run a substantial risk of death.              Okay. Now that's what I read and at that point, I said I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best answer.             The prosecutor, I mean I thought, though I'm not -- this really is ambiguous, I think, but if you do hold somebody's arms behind his back and punch him in the stomach, that does perhaps -- at least might run -- I can see a person saying that that runs a substantial risk of death.                   I mean Houdini died that way, apparently.           So maybe hitting somebody in the stomach does create a substantial risk of death.                      Do you know anything about -- one way or the other on that?             They intentionally hit somebody in the stomach, you say, knowing all about --               I realize that but what the State supreme court holds.           I think correctly, that if the person conscious of the risk knows that a particular individual is engaging in certain conduct for whom he is responsible, he is -- he is guilty of the -- if the event that you know there is a substantial risk of comes about.   I would be amazed that a State would say the contrary.              Washington -- in the State of Washington you think the law is that if Joe Jones helps Dead Eye Dick shoot his gun right at somebody's leg and then accidental -- then, you know, he doesn't aim quite right, the guy dies; then it's a good defense to say well, I knew he was Dead Eye Dick.                  I thought he'd just hit him in the leg.             I mean, that -- we know that isn't a good defense in Washington because the Supreme Court of Washington tells us that.              What's the difference between that and punching him in the stomach?               This argument -- I'm beginning to get your argument.               The statement is -- the prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to occur.   You're saying that's absolutely wrong.                 There's no support for that in the record.                  In fact what the prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that habeas was right.    Is that the argument?
07-773 +++$+++              So your theory -- I mean basically I think you concede that the other side has a point in sometimes it will be difficult to say what the dispute is precisely and, therefore, difficult to know if precisely this dispute does or does not -- one that you can get into Federal court on.                   For example, it hasn't even arisen.       You know, there is no lawsuit.                 And I guess what would happen, what the judge should say is they should say to you you'd like to have this in Federal court, wouldn't you, this dispute?                   What's it about?             And once he says what's it about, both sides will say, well, basically it started off -- it's just about collecting some money from in-state parties.       So that's not Federal.             So that, you know, something could happen here.             It could happen that they could decide they want to sue in a big class action and get huge amounts of money under usury laws of the State which don't exist, so they have to proceed under an FDIC reg, and then it could be Federal.                   And the judge might say to you:    "What?     You're just imagining."              And that would be up to the judge.             It's a kind of a defense.             But you'd say then it might be the case that it wouldn't be so hard to decide.             A real suit.      And --             And in a real suit, there is a class action brought not just on behalf of the one you're trying to sue but on behalf of everybody, where they have to proceed under a Federal reg, and they are going to get a huge amount of money, and you say that's what we want arbitrated.             So this one is not so hard to figure out.             There might be some that are.                 Well, in his case, in the Chief Justice's case, wouldn't you say they don't get into court, probably don't because they are bringing this under a State law?             Is this right?   I'm asking if it may sound favorable to you, then I'll get a good response in rebuttal.             If you read it the other way -- if you read it the other way, the way the Petitioners want to read it, then is this so or not? That then you look to see if there is Federal jurisdiction of the arbitration agreement; is that right?             Yes, under their interpretation.             So, what you could have is you could have two parties sign an arbitration agreement that lasts for a year that governs all disputes between them, and one is from Vermont; the other from California.             So there is jurisdiction. And all the disputes happen to involve just pure matters of -- that never could come into Federal court.                 I mean there are such matters you could argue about.             But nevertheless, we have a Federal court issuing this injunction, under their theory.             Assuming they are right.              Oh, I see.       The arbitration agreement has to meet the amount in controversy.              All right.       So then probably no arbitration agreement in itself meets the amount.              So if you didn't look through, then this would apply to nothing?              If the arbitration --              The arbitration agreement has to -- they talk about the arbitration agreement, then you could have really important Federal questions in substantive issues --              -- that couldn't come in because the arbitration agreement doesn't?                 Or you could have State questions that would suddenly come in because the arbitration agreement does.               The arbitration -- but now you're saying, well, that second case is never going to arise.               Probably not, because no arbitration agreement has -- so then it becomes a nullity of the statute?               Except to overcome the ouster.   Okay.   We've got your side of it. (Laughter.)
07-8521 +++$+++               Would we have to reach that question here?   I mean, I don't understand three things that you've said.    You said it says Federal; I don't see any place it says Federal.           It doesn't use that word. Then you say it doesn't say Federal and State; in my copy it does say Federal and State.                      It talks about 2254 and 2255.   So if I just read this in English, it says that once you appoint the person, and it's either State or Federal, 2254 or 2255, that person shall also represent the defendant in such competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be available to the defendant.               QED, end of the case. All right, now why isn't it?               That's right.          That's right, because they are referring to people who are under State death penalty or Federal death penalty, and what it says is that they shall get a person to represent them in these later habeas proceedings.                       And then it adds that that person -- and no point quoting it again; you heard what I just said -- it adds that that person will represent them in clemency proceedings. Now, is there any reason for thinking that Congress ---and contrary to some things mentioned, I believe that probably Congressman Conyers did read what he wrote.    He certainly referred to it enough in speeches, and those speeches make very clear to me that that is what he had in mind, what it says.               Now other people can read it differently, but I -- I mean, I've read it.    I read the language.             What's the answer?              He happens to be the person who wrote it, and it's referred to in the Solicitor General's brief, and on page 21, I took what you said, I went back and looked it up, just as you might have suggested I would by putting in the relevant citations, okay? So having looked it up, as implicitly you suggested, I think Conyers knew what he said.              I think he did mean those words to say what it says, but you can convince me to the contrary.             That's why I raised it.              Yes, they did.              My experience in Congress is that the members of Congress do know the kinds of things that they are voting on; maybe others have different experience.              I think you are wrong about that.    The reason I think you are wrong about that is that that language to which you refer is language that Congressman Conyers himself introduced in response to a bill by Representative Gekus, and in Representative Gekus's bill he referred, just like this one, to both State defendants and to the Federal defendants.                And the purpose of Conyers' amendment, which was to substitute for the Gekus amendment, was to extend, not to limit, what Gekus has done.        And he introduced lots of information, all of which referred almost uniquely to State defendants. That's then picked up in the Senate, and the Senate, which is Levin, is trying to do precisely what Conyers was trying to do in the House, which we know from the fact that he said it. Now, I can't find anything in that legislative history that supports the statement that you made on page 21 that this initially was meant to refer only to people under Federal sentence of death.
07-854 +++$+++               But I would like to follow that up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this difference between what you are arguing now and what you are arguing then matters.            I don't understand it, frankly.     I don't actually understand it, because I agree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you said:     It's a failure to disseminate information.                    And then you said:     And it's a failure to train and supervise.     You did say that.            Now, why that matters, I don't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does matter, maybe it doesn't.            So I have to say I don't understand it.     Now, help my understanding.              All right.        I know you don't, but I'm not worried about that.                    I'm worried about my understanding of your argument, and that's what I am trying to get to.         Answer this question, please, because it will help me:           The obvious response is the response the Government made.               You can take any -- which is what Justice Alito said.              So I would just like to you elaborate on it.   You can take anything that the D.A. does that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible thing he did.   And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he is, okay?   Or maybe he should be.               There we are. So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but here's what I claim:      You failed to have a system that did... and now we fill in the blank.                    And whatever that blank is, it's going to be something that would have stopped him from doing this bad thing.                   In your case, it happens to be an information dissemination system.                   In other case, it would be some other kind of system that would have the effect of stopping this bad thing.                   So, their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the end of immunity.   Okay? Now, what is your response?                   That's what I want to know.              And so, I can do that.           So can you.   You are very good at it.                And any good lawyer can do that.   And that's their point.                   So, if your only response, that's your response, your point is that a good lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others, I understand the response.          I'm not sure I agree with it.
07-869 +++$+++               It's at that part, just where you are, that I've always had a hard time not for lack of trying.   I don't understand what the word "content-based" means, and I know it's all over the law, but I've never understood it and maybe since you're relying on it 15 times you can explain it.              And the thing I don't understand it about is it seems to me government engages in thousands of different kinds of activity, and there isn't some special test.              When they say that in the jury room, the jury room is there for juries; it's not to show movies of Steven Spielberg. And there isn't some special test when you say the purpose of the biology class is to teach biology, and we don't want people coming in here teaching some other thing.   I don't understand what this special test called "content-based" is, and that's rather a deep misunderstanding on my part, but since you're depending on it, why don't you take 30 seconds or 45 seconds to see if you can help me?             It doesn't -- for example, in biology class, the school board says:                      You know, biology teacher, I want you to teach biology; I don't want you to teach politics.             And then there is some special scrutiny about how the biology teacher is to teach or -- but they say just face it.                     The jury room is for juries.    It's not for politics.                    All that is subject to some special First Amendment test?             They might.          They might. But you know a lot of them, you know you could show movies in jury rooms in the evening and people might find it much better. (Laughter.)              Are you saying -- is it your view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a government tells any group that wants to raise money for political purposes in any way they want involving the government that it can't?              No.     Okay.    I thought the answer would be no. Then, will you try to say in a sentence or two if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't apply to any kind of an effort to raise money for political purposes where they say to the government you got to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?              But then you are making -- say it always applies except in a few little exceptions. I mean I know there is one for government speech and so forth.   But you're saying whenever the government tells a person you can't, for example, go to the city hall and raise money, you can't do it in the jury room, you can't raise money here, you can't raise money there, dah, dah, dah, or you can't speak there, you can't -- it's always heightened scrutiny?              You cannot -- you have to use heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you know, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot advertise on a label for a drug.               We don't want advertising.   We don't want advertising on the label. That's heightened scrutiny.                And regulation of government employees is the same?
07-901 +++$+++               In Oregon traditionally if a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in the house commits a rape, traditionally in Oregon that would not be considered two crimes?               Can you cite me an Oregon case which says a burglar who breaks in and commits rape is only guilty of one crime?               How are you to prove these? I am always curious as to the defense policy as to why. Stricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time figuring out why.    If you have an actual case and you have to go to trial, are you prepared to put on all the evidence that although you want to say that your client did neither of these things, that if he did do them, in fact they were just one thing and weren't separate things?   I mean are you prepared to go into all that detail in front of the jury?               No, you are saying that the standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to the jury.             Okay.       So I wonder if you are prepared to put all those facts before the jury, say, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my defendant who did it.             That way, you have to have two --              And in addition, it must be true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay restitution if the facts show that there was no money taken.   And you needn't, by the way, convict the person. You can convict him without finding that. So the same would be true of restitution. We would have another jury to decide restitution, another thing that has never been done; is that right?             No, couldn't impose restitution without making a finding as to how much money was taken.   So I don't -- I don't -- I can't imagine the legislature --             All right.       The Federal courts have not and I guess the same rule would apply. Or what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug -- again, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with another jury being impanelled to try the question of whether there was a car; is that right?             It's a punishment.              Maybe not.       Maybe it would just be an in rem proceeding.             What about the -- what about the proceeding -- what about the determination that a person who is going to trial goes to an adult court rather than a juvenile court, the difference being the extent of the punishment?             You are not entitled to -- a complete defense to the punishments that they could impose.   Do you see where I am going?              I'm not sure which of these things would actual follow from your rule and which wouldn't.              But they will say no one can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system unless the person is indeed a juvenile.                 Who makes that factual finding?              If we are going to depart from what the Framers did in fact foresee in this kind of case and we do accept Apprendi as something different from what they did apply, does that require us to depart as well in all these other cases which have the kinds of differences that you have listened to?                 Counsel, don't -- well, the case that I mentioned on my account.                      I'm thinking about it -- it's not going to make any difference.
07-9712 +++$+++                  Looking at this, why can't we say the following?        Some circuits have said that they will never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of a plea agreement.     That's wrong.              It could be plain error like any other kind of a case, every other kind of issue.   Sure.    But the error here isn't plain.               On the one hand, all they did, the promise was the government agreed to request that his sentence be placed at the lowest end, and they followed it.                  In the other part they made no promise.        They simply agreed that he had demonstrated acceptance of responsibility.                  And then what they did at the trial, they said, "we don't want him to get acceptance of responsibility at this point." Now, some people could argue that here is an implicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at the trial that is contrary to their recognition in paragraph 8.     That's where it is.               On the other hand, you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has done in the meantime is commit another serious crime. So we have two arguments, one of which says they committed error, and one of which says they didn't commit error; and the argument turns on two implicit readings of paragraph 8.           Therefore, it is not plain. End of case.     What's wrong with that?                Well, I mean, the government would like a whole lot of questions answered. So what I don't see is how the government can come here because they want a lot of questions answered, and get us to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful idea; maybe it was.      But then we take the case, and now they want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious response to it because we would like you to answer five other questions. So what I want to know is, what's wrong with what I said?   Is that a possible outcome?             They can only get -- they can only get your breach if they find an implicit agreement.    The implicit agreement is that you will not tell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no longer describes the situation.               You didn't breach paragraph 8, as taken literally.                You agree he had shown that acceptance of responsibility.                   What you told the court was, now we don't think he should have this acceptance of responsibility, which previously he had shown, because he's committed another crime.                   Those are the exact words you said to the court. Now, he may have made an implicit not to do that.     On the other hand, that implicit promise may be negative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of the fact that this applies only where we don't commit another crime. So I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying you are even right.       I'm just saying, having those two arguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong.                   You aren't plainly wrong.        So how do I get to the other questions if I believe that?              Do I say, "Hypothetically if the error here were plain, which I think it isn't, then I'd like to tell you where the burden of proof lies."?    By the way, if I happened to think that that's whatever it is, then I will go into a few other things. That's really what I feel you are asking me to do because I don't think it's plain.                  Maybe the other people think it's plain.              You fulfilled paragraph 9, didn't you?                 Can you say just for me, because I am changing a little bit here in light of that question, but what is it precisely that the government said it would do that it did not do?                 What does it say?     What are the words that it says the government did not do?                 So he did agree.     "We agreed that he does qualify."               And then when you got to the court, you said, now we don't agree that he qualifies at this point.               I know you want to -- as I point out one other thing to you.                  I think it's a hard question, burden of proof and these other things, that I just turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's the prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others can disagree, that this judge knew just what the government had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying that now things have changed. And then the judge turns to the probation officer, and the probation officer says, just to reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense, according to the guidelines of the guideline manual, prohibits any acceptance of responsibility.                   Now, if that turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't matter less whose burden of proof it is.
07-984 +++$+++                Could you go --               Excuse me.        Could you go back for a second to my discussion with Mr. Olson?                  I'm thinking of it in very simplified terms.                  The simplified terms is, I think of a pipe and I think of a circumstance where some terrible pollutant comes out of the pipe that would be subject to 306; and if the pipe goes up in a river or a lake, a regular lake, it could fill up the bottom.       Seems possible.              All right.       So if it fills up the bottom, it's called fill and comes under 404.              Yes, I know, I know that. I see the point.     But I mean, it seems to me if it fills up to the bottom to whatever point, it's fill, and now it's the Army Corps of Engineers.                  If it has effluent in it, it's effluent and so now it's under EPA.                  In other words, you have both.              It's only been going on for 40 years.     I'm sure this isn't the first time they've had both.              And -- and so I don't understand.     What I would think of is if you have two sets of standards and it's both, they should satisfy both.   I'm not writing these statutes.              Now, I heard from -- and I might interpret Mr. Olson -- he may not have really said this, but the way I heard it was:                  Well, don't worry, because if it's fill and you get it over to the Corps of Engineers, they are going to apply the effluent standard anyway.     And now you are sort of saying:                    Well, or they are going to apply some standard.                  And then there was a question of well, what standard, and we got a little vague there. Now, what happens if it goes to the EPA as effluent?     Justice Alito's question is, well, do they apply the fill standard?           And between my response to these two answers, I still don't understand how it works.    It's -- help me.              Okay.       So now, if you lose this case, what we are going to have is all the fish are going to be killed by some horrible pollutant, and the -- the Army Corps of Engineers can't do anything about it, and the only reason is we put enough of the pollutant in there to fill it up to ten feet from the bottom.    And then if you did it the other way, if the EPA regulated it, it might do something terrible under 404, and they couldn't do anything about it. Now it's very hard for me to believe that that's really how these agencies have been operating for 40 years.              Is it right --              Is it right -- now, I am back on my hobby horse -- but is it right that this slurry is pushing into this lake 50 feet or 75 feet covering the bottom with some stuff?                      A lot of it's dirt, and some of it's the worst chemical ever, except it's not toxic?   Okay.      I guess cyanide isn't toxic. But the -- the -- now I just heard that if the EPA doesn't give the permit, but the Corps of Engineers does, the EPA has the power to veto the permit.   Is that right?              Why not?         If they have a veto power --              I know it comes under a different statute, but in any instance where in fact they see that some of their rules that they promulgate are being violated and they think the Corps of Engineers is not paying attention to those rules, they can veto it.              If they don't veto it, then that would be a way of reconciling these two things.             So couldn't they veto it?             And wouldn't an unacceptable adverse consequence be that it puts all this effluent into the water?             If, in fact, you have this mix, and it satisfies -- it goes to an effluent part and a fill part, in your view, what -- if the statute says both agencies regulate, they have to meet both, one or the other?    How does it work?              So fill material is only that material as to which no effluent standard applies?              404 material is material such that it is fill material and there is no effluent standard applicable?
07-9995 +++$+++              Well, why did they get it wrong?             Why do you say they got it wrong?             Does that mean even if it were Federal?    I don't know.           I'm asking.     Again, I don't know.               Is that clear as a matter -- I don't know.   Again, I'm asking.                   Is it clear as a matter of Federal law that we have lots of Federal trials, and in a Federal trial where a district judge makes an error in excusing a juror -- he shouldn't have excused the juror, there are many, many reasons for doing it, so the jury is not properly as the defense lawyer has the right to have it -- that that requires automatically a new trial?          Is that clear as a matter of Federal law or not?     And I --               I don't know the answer.               I am not talking about Magistrates, and I'm not talking about due process.                     I am asking the question, just what I asked.                   Now, you heard what I asked.     It's about jurors.               All right?          What is the answer?               I know.          I'm not asking that question.    I am asking when a lawyer -- when a -- when a judge makes a mistake and excuses a juror whom he shouldn't have excused because he thought the juror was prejudiced, let's say, and he wasn't.                      The appeals court says, you are wrong about excusing him.                     Does under Federal law the defendant become entitled to a new trial?    Not under the Constitution, under whatever you want.               Yes or no?               You think the answer is no, okay.             Did -- that's exactly what I can't figure out.         I'm trying -- forget due process. All right?       Keep that out of your mind.                   We have approximately 50 State jurisdictions, the District of Columbia, and a bunch of Federal jurisdictions.                          All right?     In those jurisdictions, to your knowledge -- you may not know this, you may not have looked it up -- but what happens in the situation where a juror -- where a juror should have been excused?                  I guess there's a new trial.     The juror should have been excused, but wasn't. I guess there's a new trial normally; is that right?             If the juror is biased. Yes.     Okay. Now suppose it's the defendant who wanted the juror and he was wrongly excused.                       All right?    So that's what the appeals court holds.                        What's the rule? Again, do they go back and look and see if it's biased? If the juror -- if the defendant didn't get the juror he wanted, somebody else took his place, do they look to see if that person was biased?                  And if not, say, too bad, defendant, you may have been right, but you lost the jury that you want, no remedy?                     What happens?              So, at least in the case of where he failed to get a preemptory, whether it's Federal or whether it's State, the Federal law and most State law is:   You lost your right to a preemptory, one of them.   You should have had it, but you are out of luck, if -- if the juror who replaced the replacement, the juror who was there, you know, who otherwise wouldn't have been is a fair juror.              Well, what about the last hypothetical?              What is the law there? That's what I am trying to get at.                 I mean, my initial instinct would be that if a defendant doesn't get the jury that the law entitles him to, that's an error.                 And you normally would think it was harmful, because you can't say, in honesty, it was harmless, it's the jury that's supposed to decide.          I suspect it would work out that way.     I have never looked into it. How has it worked out?              All right.       So in other words, they have often said you don't get a new trial?              Okay.
08-1008 +++$+++                Suppose the reason -- suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we think class actions are very often a very good thing, because a lot of people who are hurt can get some recovery and it acts as a deterrent.             But there is some bad things about them.        And one of the bad things is, somebody files a lawsuit, and before you know it, the litigation expenses are so high that the company feels it has to settle.     Now, in our view that latter factor predominates.   And that means that these procedures, class actions, will sometimes -- too often -- lead to the unjust, inefficient settlement of disputes.                And that's why we are doing it.               All right, if that's exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the judgment of the rule that they are saying it is efficient -- an inefficient procedure.              It is inefficient in terms of the object of -- of the Federal rules and what the class wanted.              We want efficient methods of achieving justice.            Overdeterrence because they feel that the class action procedure is one that leads to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the class action procedure does not lead to the efficient determination of disputes but to the inefficient and unjust determination.     That's their honest reason.            No, it does.     It says it s the judicial process that does it.            It's the judicial process and its expanse --            -- that forces the settlements that create unjust results.            That may be, and suppose they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period.              That wouldn't last for 2 seconds, wouldn't it?            So how is this different?
08-103 +++$+++             Well, there's some that can't be found.   So if we take your position, there's some that can't be found, we just can't create our database.            I mean, that's the problem that's underlying the fairness of this thing.            In terms of if we take your approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you are just out of luck.      That is to say, there will not be databases collected, because they cannot be complete because we cannot find the owner.                If we take the position that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle disappears and now it's a question of the fairness of the situation.             That's right.       I just wonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of provision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.             That's the underlying fairness.    There might be -- maybe they will win on that.   I don't know what the merits of that are.                But certainly an absolute bar might sometimes help some copyright owners, but many times it will hurt them, because since they can't be found they can't be compensated.   And if we set up a system and put some money in it, so if they are ever found they will be compensated, that will help them. So that's why I ask the question, why would a Congress, that wants to help copyright owners create this kind of system?      When all the things you are talking about can be brought into play when we consider the fairness of the system.             They wouldn't waive it then.     I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is this:     let's take a group of people who want to make databases; now they want to use copyrighted material. There is a subset of people who have written it they can't find, so they say here's what we will do.                     We will take $100 billion, and we will put it in a fund, and like ASCAP, that fund can administer this money for the benefit of anyone who turns up. Now, maybe that's illegal under some law. Maybe the class isn't right.              Maybe they can't get proper representation.         Maybe it's inadequate, et cetera.    But what I don't fail to see -- what I fail to see, is how -- whether you could do that or not do it has anything to do with registration, because we are talking about the people who aren't here, all of whom, if you ever bring suit when he's found, will register the copyright.    The only reason they haven't registered, we don't know who they are, that's why.                     Maybe they have registered, for all we know.              Maybe they can't do that because it would be an unfair result.                  But where is it in this provision of law that's designed to stop that ever from happening?              Maybe it won't, by the way.              It depends on what the terms of the settlement are.            We could have a subclass that allows a subset of those people to come into court. No reason you couldn't.       So I don't know whether or not it's true that they won't register when they are found.              In 1909 Congress thought all this through with the databases and so forth? (Laughter.)                But why doesn't it?             Just out of curiosity.     You are making a --                Well, you say if somebody who owns the copyright.                Yes.       No.      No.    But what we want to do is we want to have, in our database, all of the material written about slavery, and, lo and behold, there are 4,000 books that we can't trace.                        Who, now, owns the copyright 100 years later?                      And there is no way to get those into our database.                Whether --                All right.           Now, that's a sort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it should be, but it's rather surprising that this law is the law that will answer that question.
08-1065 +++$+++              There's a different tendency, which I would say this is a slight fluke, what you're describing.     I'm more worried about what Justice Alito brought up, that, other things being equal, I think it's probably a good thing to get prosecutors involved in the questioning process.                    That -- that has a kind of check on the police. And the concern I'd have is that the --this will discourage the prosecutors from becoming involved in the witness -- witness questioning process, at least not before the police are well on the way.                     And that is a very negative incentive, I would think. So what is your most pro-prosecutorial rule that you could live with that will in fact minimize the risk of that kind of disincentive?                  Now, are you just going to say, well, Buckley?             Or is there something -- I mean, I can see Buckley with the, you know, probable cause.     It turns on and off as you're talking to the witness.     First what he says, you have the probable cause; then you don't; then you do; then you don't.                     I mean, I -- I'm not -- I just want you to give your best thought to this problem and tell me what is the most safe rule that will allow you to win your case?             We have amicus briefs here that give us a lot of reason.              They say -- they say it's very discouraging to, you know, AUSAs or DAs going in and talking to the witnesses with the police.               And they say they do it in Chicago, I think.     In other places, they do it a lot.             Well, also, you're making me more worried because I think, if 85 percent of all the defendants -- or 90 percent plead guilty, it might be a highly desirable thing to get prosecutors involved in the truth-discovering process, I mean, so that they don't just see themselves as the job of -- well, we're going to take somebody, put them in jail. Maybe -- maybe that's a reason for pushing it back a little bit, this -- this line.            Where have you got it now? You've got it as when there is probable cause for believing that someone has committed a crime?            Someone?         So it's someone -- needn't be the particular person they eventually indict?            Uh-huh.
08-108 +++$+++               Well, I think that's what we normally bring into sentencing.                I mean, normally, and that we don't impose mandatory.                    We impose mandatory sentences when the person does something, you know, that's wrong and he knows it is wrong. When harm occurs, and the harm wasn't known or intended, you can take care of it if you are a judge. You increase the sentence.         That's the problem.               Well, why not just says "means of identification," then?              I mean, it's odd to write a statute that has elements and you put the word "knowingly," and the knowingly is supposed to modify some elements but not others.            I can't think of other statutes that do that.      There may be some. It's pretty peculiar.                You could have left off the last element.     I mean, if you are drafting a criminal statute, anyone would know that.              Give me one where what they have done is they have used "knowingly" at the beginning, and there are four elements of the crime, and -- I'm not saying there are none, but I would like to know what they are where "knowingly" doesn't modify something there is strict liability for.              That's going to be jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like -- there could be -- there could be some.                   But I don't see -- you tell me.              I could understand your argument if you are saying you cannot tell from the tell simply from the text what the answer is.                You can only tell the answer if you say -- know what the answer is if you say Congress had victims in mind, and if we are going to worry about victims, we are not going to worry -- we are going to take a narrow rather than a broad view of "knowingly." If that's your position, you agree that if you simply look at the text of this statute without considering confessional policy, you don't win?               All that is true, and that is actually where I was going.                It -- it seems to me where the ambiguity is precisely -- is that none of us doubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft. And where the argument lies is between did Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to engage in identity theft or people who, while not intending to do so, have that effect.                    That's the issue.              And I don't thing I can resolve that one way or the other from anything you have said.    It is rather hard to say.              So, therefore, suppose I use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying out.    I am not buying it. In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences, there is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of Lenity with bite.    And that is because mandatory minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw some people into the box who shouldn't be there.                   And if this person should be there and we put him outside, the judge could give him the same sentence anyway. So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person outside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the government is small.       The harm to the individual by wrongly throwing him into the box is great.                   The Rule of Lenity is, therefore, limited to a very small subset of cases where it has particular force, but this is one of them.               That's why I raised it.
08-1107 +++$+++  
08-1119 +++$+++              What he -- what I think his argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the definition of "bankruptcy assistance," you will see there are seven different things that a person could do and fall within that definition.                And all of those seven things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies you see advertised on television, which say:                   We will help you with your debts.          And they probably aren't lawyers. And, so, if you look at the six of the seven things, it's clear that all of those are provided by those television companies.            And the seventh is simply added in, namely the providing legal representation, to be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies actually does something that is legal representation, even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too. So he is saying, read the whole paragraph and then you will see they are after the companies that appear on television and they're not after lawyers.                     And then he says that's the history of the bill, and so forth and so on.   Okay. Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't -- can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you did.               We will charge you very little, we will save you money.               I am a lawyer, by the way. (Laughter.)            I have relatives who aren't, and you can bring one of them.             I don't how this works exactly.    I'm not an expert.           I thought that, when someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for ongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's fee.   Otherwise, people could never be represented.            Well, so why is there some incentive here?   All the attorney has to do is follow ordinary procedure.
08-1134 +++$+++           But why would it not be a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?                 If -- the lawyer knows that he is supposed to make this special claim to get this kind of discharge -- he knows an ordinary claim won't do it.     He submits a paper that asks for the ordinary discharge, but he has to sign it, and that sign -- that signature, is a -- is a certification that to the best of his knowledge, the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law. So if he signs it knowing that that isn't the way to do it -- indeed, there is not even an argument for doing it that way, for modifying the law -- then why isn't that a sanctionable matter under Rule 11?             I mean, the reason I ask that --             The reason I ask that is I think the argument on the other side is that it's so clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying you have special hardship; that that s so clear what Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back and attack it, if they didn't do it.               I mean, that's basically, in my mind, their argument. But I think a simpler way would be to say if it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating from the way that Congress set it out, to which there is no legal objection.     Now, is it really -- what do you think of that?          I wasn t making any conditions.          That's -- that s what why it s a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is -- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does - the law does have the three categories -- the three categories that your friend described.          And this third category is supposed to prevent a discharge even where the creditor doesn't object, unless certain things are filled out, and they weren't. So the three are there, made an objection. If at any point the creditor had come in and objected, not to the discharge but, you know, just said, hey, it's the wrong form; you ve got it wrong.              It's like an error - they win.          But -- but they waited a very long time.          So now they have to come in, I guess, under 60(b), and it must be either 60(b)(4) or 60(b)(6) --          -- and I take it there s a time limit on that, and the time limit is  a reasonable time.     Is that how we are supposed to do, that we have to say they didn't file -- if fact they never filed 60 -- it's your side that filed the 60(b)(4), I gather.    So this is good and mixed up.          It s good and mixed up.     So what is -- how is it supposed to work?          Yes.
08-1175 +++$+++              Is -- is there since then -- I mean, as I read it now I see that, as I said, it seems very clear that they intend you to have to say that the counsel has to be -- is present with you. Present, okay?     Now the FBI warnings, which they did say is consistent, don't say that.             They don't.             Okay.        Now, since the time of Miranda, has this Court ever talked about that?                 Has there been any lower court or have there been -- has the practice of the departments to any great extent been such that they stopped talking, or did not talk, or never spoke about a right to have a counsel with you during -- during --  during  just dropped out.               They just said forget about  during.               It wasn't --          This Court has referred to  during.
08-1191 +++$+++               Give me reasons for it. The strongest one for it, the strongest example against you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example. Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and meets Jones in the hotel.            And Jones says, I have a bridge I want to sell you.             Look out the window.          Say, Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge?                 Yes.      And that's a lie. Here's what you do.              You invest in buying shares of my company sold on the German exchange.                    Okay?             Conduct took place in the United States, a terrible fraud.                 This is contrary to fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it should apply at least where Schmidt is an American citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then. What do you do with that case?                 The fraud took place totally here.                 Sign the paper here in New York.             Sign the paper, right here, and give me the money, because I have an urgent appointment.              Yes, but your position and hers is:     That's no more a valid claim than this one or any other one we dream up.             That's why it's a pure example, and I want to know how you feel about it. And -              Or any other.     Or -- read the next word.                How does it hurt the other countries if what we would say on their reading of this is, Congress has said, "Look, if some terribly bad conduct happens in the United States; they lie through their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will give you a remedy.      Come to us" -- now, how does that hurt Australia?                Or France or England or any of these others?                So it's not as easy to apply this, you think?          Now, on your theory, I guess Schmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge. Okay, now wait.      What happens is he calls Schmidt on the telephone, Jones, and he says I own the Brooklyn Bridge. Actual, right, direct?          Under your test, correct?                Schmidt is in Germany.     He calls him up.                All -- everything -- you have to assume he's going to buy the thing on the exchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn.                  He is lying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn Bridge.   So he calls Schmidt.               I am interested in -- he calls Schmidt.      Causation, that's what your last pages of your brief, focus on that.                He calls him and he lies to him.   Actual.     In your theory -                Go back to my Brooklyn Bridge example.      Everything is hatched in your boiler room.             And they communicate the lie by calling Schmidt in Berlin on the telephone, directly.             I'm looking -             No, I'm focusing on the last pages of your brief.          Where you turn this whole thing on the directness of the causation.             I'm accepting that for the moment.   What's bothering me, taking off from what the Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test. Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue.                But when you phone your parent company, knowing that they will put it in the prospectus and Schmidt will read it, you can't sue. And then what occurs to me is suppose you phoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent company and you knew they would tell a reporter.               I'm focusing on the practicality of your causation test.              Correct.              You think that's the question here?   You think the question is whether this really took place in Florida?             I didn't think that was the question.              Let's skip -- skip my question because other people may ask.
08-1198 +++$+++            That's where I started this.   We don't get many contract interpretation cases, and that's why I -- I needed to go back to Jack Dawson, who is a great contracts professor.               And I am --           What?   The -- but the -- as I recall, the way I would have interpreted -- imagine a worker who says:    I have a right, permission -- it's permissible for me to eat lunch next to the machine.               The employer says no.     The question was what is -- does the contract permit this or not? So the arbitrator or the judge reads the words.     Nothing.   They have no idea.            Then the judge or the arbitrator reads the rest of the contract.                Hasn't a clue.    Then the arbitrator or the judge goes and looks and sees what's practice around here?               "I don't know." Then they might look to what happens in the rest of the industry.     Then they might look to what happens in foreign countries with comparable industries.                Then they might look to public policy. They might look almost to anything under the sun they think is relevant, and the way, in jargon, you describe the bottom line is:               They have found a meeting of the minds as to what this means. Now, of course, it isn't really a meeting of the minds.    But that's just the summary of the conclusion as to what, objectively read, those words in the contract mean.    Now, that's how I think I would have learned it. Is that still done, or is there some other way of describing it?          If that's contract law --          -- then I take it what they're saying is:    It may be true that the arbitrators, when they looked at some of those elements, really got it wrong.    Now, if they are correct on that -- this is the other question I have.         You are going to say:       No, they're not -- they didn't get it that wrong; wrong, maybe, but not that wrong. All right.     Now, can they not do this?         The next person who has this form contract does not so readily agree it's up to the arbitrator to say whether that contains a class action or not.              Rather, they say: I read this contract as reserving that question to the court.   It's not the same language as was there in Bazzle; it's not the same industry of the kind you had in Bazzle; and, therefore, a judge should decide that. That's the meeting of the minds on the who question.          And then we ll get it all resolved, because the judge might come out differently if they're right, and maybe arbitrators will follow the judge. I m interested, because we might have to write something, in your answer to that question.          Not -- we know they're going to -- they have something already in place.          Yes.          Uh-huh.          There s a supplemental agreement here because I thought --          -- in reading this, the supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3 --          -- of the AAA, and it s supplement --          -- rule 3 of the AAA supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote, "determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned, partial, final award, on the construction of the arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class."             So I thought the supplemental agreement said --   -- apply Rule 3, and therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the question put in Rule 3.       Is that right?             So then we could get the question by reading page 7 of the blue brief.
08-1200 +++$+++                That's true of antitrust defendants, too.               No, I see that.   Is it -- is it -- what do you think of the idea that your opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the substantive provisions, so that there is no violation for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are against them?   What you would have to do. That isn't so hard to do as I first thought, because the words that seem to make -- the primary words of what is outlawed are the words "unfair or unconscionable means."        Now I -- I doubt -- you would know -- I doubt that there are other words in the statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that really shouldn't be forbidden.              I mean, they shouldn't call people up in the middle of the night and harass them and so forth. But -- but you could read unfair and unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably. What about that?             That's right.       I was seeing a special problem with lawyers.              Call -- the unfairness problem that you are talking about, call that the antitrust problem, because it is just as much.                But I saw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the impossible situation that you've just described. Now it's with respect to that problem that he offers the cure of reading the words "unconscionable" and what is it?   "Unconscionable and unfair means." Read those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the dilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not have an incentive to -- to skew his advice.              I was wondering if you know, can you give me just a rough idea, of the percentage of instances in which people write to the FTC to take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just says, "Well, we won't tell you."                How many have asked?                I mean, it seems to me that's the obvious solution to the problem, that -- until you hold they are not -- they are liable for mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of time and -- and get a safe harbor. It's -- so I don't know what we could do to suggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the statute, should be used.             Well, all right.       But I mean, if there have been seven requests and four answers then all these horrible things that are going to happen if you do say there is -- unless you have mistake of law defense, aren't going to happen.                Because all that has to happen is that people write to the FTC and they get an answer.             That means lawyer, if you are worried about this, go write before you do it.             Oh, now I do see -- which is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer, and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC idea.   It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much.                    I just wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their clients, if they made an effort, might be able to get the financing for the FTC so they could have enough people to respond quickly to the letter. (Laughter.)
08-1214 +++$+++           Just before you finish, Chief, is it all right if you -- I'm not quite clear on how this pre-emption works, and I perhaps didn't have it right.     But imagine 301 had never been enacted.   I thought, had that never been enacted, certain kinds of State claims, particularly tort claims of interference with labor contracts, for example, might have been pre-empted anyway by the Labor Relations -- by the -- by the LMRA. I thought that did the basic pre-emptive job.   And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301 creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit.            Now, my thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would like you to explain how it works.        No, no, because I think that your response to the Chief Justice's question, which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort actions and State activities that interfere with labor relations, as this might.       It is, rather, section 301 itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because it pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any, and -- and that's why I became uncertain.
08-1224 +++$+++           Well, why -- why not?   I mean, is there anything to prevent the United States Government to say:     Mental illness is a serious problem in the United States, and we feel the States sometimes do a good job, sometimes they don't, but we want to set up a group of Federal mental hospitals and treatment centers of the most modern kind, and in these circumstances, there will be a handful of people who pose a threat to themselves or others, in which case they must be restrained. There might be due process problems, whether you have the right person, whether they should be restrained, et cetera.      But doesn't the Constitution give authority to the Federal Government to set up a system of mental illness prevention and cure, if in fact they determine that that's a desirable use of Federal money?          It doesn't have the power to set up hospitals?          In other words, if the doctors were to say, there are a thousand people here suffering from mental illness, your own daughter or mine or someone has a -- is threatening suicide or threatening murder?      There are lots of real cases like that, where people have terrible times, and there are not adequate State facilities.            And were the Federal Government to say, this is a problem that we wish to go into and help with, you are saying the Constitution prohibits that?   Where does it prohibit it?        Well, once you re down that road -- I was rather surprised, but not too surprised, that, I think perhaps with prompting, I heard you say, I think, that the Tenth Amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from setting up a system of mental care, which you d better tell the people across the street, if that's your view. The -- the -- is that what you are actually saying?         Of national mental care for mentally ill people.         Because you either think that the Constitution prohibits that or you think it permits it.         Yes, probably the Commerce Clause power.         So it's fine --        The -- go back once more because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I think the government could do, there will be a few people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those hospitals for themselves or others  benefit. If you set up a system of mental hospitals, that's even more true.     If you set up a university, some people will be sick, and they will be in the infirmary, and occasionally, you will come across a person who has to be restrained, et cetera. Now, once you are down the road where you admit the government can do that, how is a prison any different?        You set up a prison where, in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal release date, so can it in prison. Maybe there's a better way, but why isn't this just a normal part of running this institution, just as it is in the other cases?        No, I'm not, actually.      I'm just showing you the connection between running an institution, which, for whatever set of reasons in the Constitution, you have the authority to do, and then it becomes, as part of that institution, part of the job to take care of people in a certain way. Sometimes that requires a restraint, and sometimes that restraint could last beyond the period where in the absence of that need the person would no longer be part of the institution.              That's true of a hospital, of a mental hospital, and of a prison. Whether they rest on the same power or a different power, the government has the power, Federal, to establish all of those institutions. I'm just drawing institutional connections. That's -- that's what I'm saying.           Maybe that's an unnecessarily complex argument, but I was just seeing it that way.
08-1301 +++$+++           Well, what about going back to the purpose?   There's a section on page 26 of the House report where they go in some length to saying that the purpose is this is going to help with 100,000 missing people.   Don't worry; if you can't remember, it doesn't matter.   What they say is there are 100,000 missing. What they do is they travel, let's say, from Alabama to California and they don't register.              Now, this statute is going to help with that. Well, how does it help with that?             They are already supposed to register in California.              And I thought, well, maybe the way it helps with that is that it imposes some new information requirements, so that Alabama, if it were complying, would now have a lot of information about the sex offender, and it would have an obligation -- it could more easily track him down, or at least California could or somebody could more easily track him down, because he has to give information to Alabama, and Alabama has a registry up. Is there something like that in this?          Yes.          Yes, but that s -- that s true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved.          That is, what I m -- the reason I brought up the other is because if this is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress might be trying to get as many people as they want to register. But this -- this also serves some purpose, like we re going to make Alabama get some information, makes it easier to catch these people, that purpose wouldn't be served when the travel takes place before this takes effect because Alabama wouldn't have kept the information then.          Okay.        So Congress passes this statute.   And how does it help specifically with that?          Okay.        So the person who hasn't registered in California --          He s afraid of the Feds. He didn't -- he wasn't afraid of the California police, but he s afraid of the Feds.            Okay.     I've got it.   I've got that.   Any other thing?          Okay.        As far as I can read that page, it seemed to me, insofar as what you ve just said is true, that would happen only after this statute is passed.   And, therefore, the fact that he had moved before the statute is passed would not trigger the cooperation.    It might trigger the Fed prosecution part, but it wouldn't trigger the cooperation part.          The only reason I bring it up is if this is a very close case.                That tends to cut somewhat against you; namely, that the thing applies full-force in terms of its purposes to people who travel after, but it only applies as sort of this weak thing to people who travel before.             Have you been able to find -- when in doubt about the purpose, let's turn to the language.   Is it the case that you found any other statute, any other statute, where Congress phrased a jurisdictional hook in the present tense?             Do you find anywhere where they re both phrased in present tense and it was pretty clear that Congress intended to catch activity that was -- at least where the jurisdictional part took place before the statute took effect?              You find that good an analogy anywhere?          One last one.        It should help with a minor point.     But -- but I take it, under the statute, you have to register if you are a sex offender. And that's true whether you ve moved or not moved?          Yes.          But it's a crime -- it's a crime under the section we re talking about only if you are both the person who had to register and you didn't and you moved?         Yes.     Okay.          Everybody in the State has to register if they meet that definition?          Moved or not?         Okay.
08-1314 +++$+++        Nothing in the agency that I can find says that the agency really wanted a mix of options.     I mean, they said it's up to the manufacturer. But in Geier which I think all of this could be just avoided.       And the agency would simply say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just the minimum.     It's so easy to say that, but I haven't found agencies saying it.     I don't know why.       We are forced to deal with the situation we have; and the situation we have in Geier is filled with indications that they really wanted a mix because of the unusual circumstances present there.       You have to point to something here that shows that.       It also said -- it did say as a practical thing, not -- not some theoretical legal thing.     Who is most likely to know what 40,000 pages of agency record actually mean and say?     People in the agency.     And the second most likely is the SG's office, because they will have to go tell them.       So if the government continuously says, this is what the agency means and the agency is telling them, yes, this is what it means, the chances are they will come to a better, correct conclusion than I will with my law clerks -       -- because I have a lot to do.     All right. (Laughter.)       That's the practical.     I'm sorry, but that is the practical idea that I think underlies what was said in Geier.       No, but it did -- we are dealing with 1989 primarily.       And in 1989, I think -- we are at least quoted on the other side -- what the agency said was, well, we see these lap and shoulder belts are actually more effective.     Now, we are reluctant to recommend them for the center seat or aisle seat because people might get caught in the spools.     On the other hand, manufacturers may be able to work out that problem.     Therefore, we encourage the manufacturer to try to figure out a way around it. And the SG, looking at all that stuff, says, you see, they didn't mind if manufacturers were put under another legal obligation to do it, because they'd have no objection to making the manufacturers do it, they are just not certain yet.       Now that's -- that's how I read what was said.       They wrote those cases where manufacturers are able to design and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the aisleway's purpose of allowing access to more rearward seating positions, NHTSA encourages the manufacturers to do so." It doesn't sound like they are against a tort suit that would require you to do so, because, in principle at least, all of those things should be taken into account.       Those arguments are what I think Justice Sotomayor was saying:     It is a huge problem for manufacturers.     It's called tort suits in different places and different juries and different States.     But that is beyond the scope of this case. If the agency wants to displace those tort suits often, all they have to do is say that the purpose is something like you are saying and that they are intended to be displaced.       It doesn't have to.     That's why I am only making this comment, rather than in the form of this question that maybe I don't understand why they don't.     It would make our job simpler.
08-1322 +++$+++               On the first one, imagine that the -- a trust owes some money to the government. Now, suppose a lawyer representing the trust recovers. Now, they recover on a separate debt, okay?                       Separate debt?   One.    That money goes to the trust.                    Right?              The trust first owes -- the trust owes $1,000 to the government.                       The trust then independently recovers $500 from the government on a different matter.              The government couldn't offset that?              Yes.      Of course it could.              But the trust is not a person entitled to the benefit of the payment.            The beneficiaries of the trust are entitled to the benefit of the payment.             It's not entitled to the benefit of the $500.        The trust holds money for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust.                So --             -- it can t -- you agree that that couldn't be?             Yes, and once you agree that that couldn't be, I think you are in trouble on your first argument.        I'm not sure.             Well, similarly, the -- the guy -- the client here receives the benefit of the money that he has just gotten from the government, including the attorney's fees.        It happens that he can't keep those attorney's fees, just as the trust can't keep the $500.   He has to give the attorney's fees to the lawyer, just as the trust eventually has to give the $500 to the beneficiary.     So I'm simply saying -- drawing a parallel, which -- go on to the next issue.              Well, how is it different? Look. This, what I was talking about, has nothing to do With EAJA.              It has to do with when the government's allowed to offset some money.            And it's allowed to offset some money when the money is money that it would otherwise give to a payee.     All right?              And then you've defined "payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in that money.              And I think that the client here has no more and no less beneficial interest whether he's a person or whether he's a trust.                    That was my point.              Okay.              I don't understand your earlier point.              Imagine that if Joe Smith is in a lot of financial trouble.              His house is being foreclosed on --              -- all his bank accounts are attached.    Then he gets some money from the government and -- including an EAJA fee.              And it's $5,000 of money and 1,000 for the fee.      They put it in his bank account.             It was attached, good-bye, nobody sees the money, because it's whoever attached it got the money.                   Is that possible?             I'm making this up.           I'm not talking about the government.                 I'm saying the government paid him 5,000 plus 1,000 in an EAJA fee, and the bank got all the money because it had attached his bank account.   Is that possible?             I'm making it up.           No.     It has nothing to do with -- I'm just making up --             -- a hypothetical.             All right?             You follow that.           Those are the facts.             Okay.       So a year later, Joe Smith is doing much better.             Couldn't the attorney now sue him for the $1,000, say I d like it?                      It went to the bank because they had attached the bank account.              All right.         Now, suppose it happened to be that that 6,000, 5 for the one and 1 for the other, came from Social Security.                     Then how does that make a difference?              It couldn't take 1,000?              Couldn't take any of it. Because of?              Is that in here?              And the EAJA fee counts as a Social Security benefit?              I changed it and said, now, how does it matter if it s Social Security? (Laughter.)             If you win this case?             In other words -- in other words, no one can attach?          No one can -- no one get the EAJA fee by attaching the bank account of the client?             Okay.             Well, skip my points. They re too complicated. (Laughter.)
08-1332 +++$+++              But what s wrong with his deciding:   I don't like to do this anymore?                   I don't want to collect all this money; it's too complicated; and so I don't know how many of these messages are related to work and how many they are just mucking around prying into each other's business.             So I would like to know, so therefore I'm going to look and see.                    Now, what s unreasonable about that?             Oh, no.             I'm saying what's -- the city owns the pager.            It's a pager used for work. They are giving a privilege to people if they want to use it off work.     It seems to be involving a big amount of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to see how much of this is being used for work and how much is of this not being used for work. My question, which I just repeated, is why is that an unreasonable thing?                Fine.       And then if that s not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is any different?                How does that differ from what I just said?                No, I understand.           I thought it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I said.    That they wanted to look into this because they are tired about collecting so much money. It's the third time I've said the same thing; probably it's my fault I m not being clear.                But it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes including prying into people's business, which wasn't too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get the -- the charges right. Now, that sounds like what the jury said they were doing, too.   And my question was -- I don't see anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where you re the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where -- where -- where you re paying for this in the first place.   So the reason I ask it is I would like you clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it.              That's the conclusion.     Now, what's your reason?             Well, explain that one to me.             Okay?       So I start off thinking that seems to be reasonable to me.                   That's what I would do.             So all right.       Now you tell me why that isn't reasonable.             All right.       But the officers might say:       I don't want you to read these messages because they happen to be about the sexual activity of some of my coworkers and their wives and me, which happened to be the case here.             Now, he says, I still want to know.   I will be repeating it.              All right.     So what -- that didn't sound very practical.             What's the other way?             Well, the officer is going to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related.                  I ll tell you that.    I only had two.             Okay.       What's a third way?             That would have been rough on them.    Because you want to let them have a few; you need pizza when you re out on duty.                     You want to -- there are --              Look, so far I listened to four things, and I'm just being naive about it.                    I ll read it more closely, but I don't see why these four things are so obviously more reasonable than what they did.              But the question, in the Constitution, the word is "unreasonable."                   Is it a reasonable or unreasonable?             So the question -- what I asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000. But I could say a person who doesn't want to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the unverified word of the officers who were using these for God knows what is not being unreasonable.                   That's the ultimate issue.    And that's why I m putting it to you to show me that what they did was unreasonable.
08-1341 +++$+++              I assume you could make all that argument on remand, if we remand it.           But what's your argument -- apparently from what I've read in this case, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error that nobody else uses.             And it says that all the other circuits say:     This is our set of standards, and we've set them forth.     And the Second Circuit says:        No, it's -- you have to have a new trial if there s any possibility, no matter how unlikely.             Now, nobody else uses that. It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any justification for their using it?             Because unless I can hear a justification, I would guess I would vote to say send it back and let them use the same standard anybody else does.             What's your response to that?             So why don't you make the --          The very magnitude of the error would argue for -- you d win on any test. I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test that is specially designed to find when there is hardly any error?   Here there s such a bigger error, according -- that you think that you would have won under any test. So that -- so why -- why do you do have to have this special favorable test?            That's -- that's the question that I'm thinking of.            I'm not thinking of whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the -- how much evidence there was and how awful it was.          That's true.       And also no person should be convicted with a confession that was coerced.     And no person should be convicted with evidence given under torture.             And no person should be convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police. Now, for all those latter things, every court apparently uses the normal standard.                So why would we in this case use a special standard?
08-1371 +++$+++               So I have an absolute void in this record, which in turn I think would be important to fill that void, because their justification --              -- is they don't want to get into this, it's too complicated, and we re not doing that much harm to them because they can meet off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of these things. And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay bias issue, and -- and they want to say:                That isn't much, because that isn't really the point here, and that's what we think, anyway.             It's just an example of something. So with that great unclarity, asked to decide a constitutional issue where I feel I d need more facts and I don't have them --              -- the more justification to know what it really is, which I don't have, what should I do?              What s supposed to happen? I don't know the answer to this.                 Hastings, let's say, or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say we re open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews, conservative, and reformed.               And then the orthodox say we want men and women to sit separately. Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we ll let the reform come, we ll let the conservatives come, but not the -- not the orthodox Jews.                     They can't have their service.       Would -- would that be constitutional?             Yes, but what is your opinion?             So if, in fact, the -- the --             -- they have clubs and they re not services, and what they do is they discuss -- they discuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can they have separate discussions --             -- men from -- men and women?             I guess your answer to that is the orthodox Jews cannot.           They cannot have separate women's groups in their organization, which is an after religious school organization.              Outside of the university, et cetera.              Well, that's their problem here.              And their reason to put in a sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews to meet separately on the campus -- men in one group, women in another -- and discuss the religious service -- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting none like that is?              Well, I'm trying to make it as close as possible.              They have a small orthodox club.
08-1394 +++$+++           There's no problem?   I went through the 200 pages, and I counted -- this is only my own subjective recounting of it, but I counted six of whom only one lasted, but I counted five others that they had to use peremptories on that include one juror, 29, who herself was a victim of this offense to the tune of $50,000 or $60,000.      The judge said:      I will not challenge her for cause. I counted another, juror -- what's this one -- juror number -- number s 74, who when he looked her square in the eye and said, "Can you be fair?"                  She said, "I can't say yes for sure.           No." Okay?   So, in my own subjective account, there were five here, maybe six, certainly three, that perhaps if they'd had an appeal on peremptories, which apparently they don't, they might have said these should have been challenged for cause.              So I m concerned about the 5 hours, about the lack of excusal for cause, about the very, very brief questions that he provided to people who had said on the questionnaire they could be -- they could be biased.            They said we think he's guilty, for example. And all those are cause for concern.               At the same time, I m worried about controlling too much a trial judge.     I ve expressed those concerns.               I know this is a special case.        Half, almost, of the jury questionnaires they just threw out.                 And the community -- you know all the arguments there.                  You see what's worrying me.      And I m worried about a fair trial in this instance and to say -- and I'm genuinely worried, and -- and I d like to hear your response to the kind of thing I'm bringing up.             I d never heard of an instance where a trial judge would not challenge for cause -- but I'm not saying it doesn't happen -- where the juror herself is a victim of the offense to the tune of $50,000 to $60,000.     See, we are getting into an area that I'm not familiar with, but I think that that's not supposed to be.          No, but it's not just one. There were like five, of which I have given you the worst, and they had to use up all their peremptories. And they can't appeal this.         And it's that taken together, plus the one who sat, juror 11, provides, as they point out for the reasons they say, some cause for concern.   And that's what I'm trying to get at.            Go ahead with it, but they didn't challenge 63 for cause, so I guess they waived it.          Let's try juror number -- let's try 76:    Judge:     "Here's the detail that really concerns me.    You said, 'I think they're all guilty.'" "Right." "Now, there's nothing wrong with thinking that, if that's what you really think.                 You just need to tell us that. Okay. That's what you think, isn't it? It's been a long time since I answered that questionnaire. Right.    Now, as you" -- Okay?   Now, that s -- that, as far as I could tell, is as close as I can get to a recantation of what she thought originally.          You can -- well, you focus on what you just put together.          You said intent to deceive, intent to violate the law.        I believe in another case, you re saying they don't have to have an intent to violate the law because there was no State law that prohibited whatever was at issue. So is the government now saying -- which is a big difference -- that you cannot convict somebody unless they know, i.e., they intend to violate a law that forbids the conduct in which they are engaging, other than this honest services law, or are you not saying that?          You re not saying that.          Then if you're not saying that, what the person has to carry around with them is an agency treatise. (Laughter.)          Yes, I mean, of course they intend to -- it's not the case that is obvious; it's the case that is not obvious that worries me, and --          -- in the case that is not obvious, of course they intend to withhold information.     I agree with that.          But the problem is they don't know it's unlawful to do so.
08-1402 +++$+++         Now, why is it -- I m just not clear in my mind.        Why is this siphoning bad?       My impression, which may be wrong, is you -- you have a thousand people in the room, let's say, and if you let the district courts choose first, people will serve nearer where they live. Now -- and so most of them would rather serve nearer where they live.             And the result of that could be, for the reasons that were stated, that then there are fewer minorities on the more general jurors that draw from a wider area, and I don't know about the merits of that. I mean, I see a negative, and I see a positive.    So is it -- it doesn't seem to me obviously bad, nor is it obviously good.            So what should I do?         Right.         Well, but -- but that's just the explanation of the problem that we're seeing.         The problem we're seeing is that if Grand Rapids has a higher juror utilization rate and they have a higher minority population, then you will end up with the leftover juries having a lower minority population. Now, the explanation for that is that you choose the district judges -- you choose the district jurors first.    My question to you is:            I -- if you're just a -- I'm not instructed in this area.              If you were just to tell me, what do I think of that, I would say I'm not sure. I think you have fewer minorities, that's true, but people get to serve closer to home.             Now -- now, can you enlighten me a little bit about this?         Well, I wouldn't say that, but I still haven't -- I will try again.            Forget the cases. As I m hearing this, all I m hearing is: Well, if you let the -- if you say that the wider area should choose first, you will get a higher number of minorities, but very tiny number; I mean a very small addition, one or two people.            And if you do it the way they re doing it, you'll lose those one or two people, but you will let people serve closer to home. So I just think -- as a person, not as a judge -- that's why I am letting you answer it as a judge -- but I mean, I d say, well, it doesn't sound like much of a big deal.      And -- and I do see an advantage in this, of the way they are doing it, so, now, you tell me what's -- what's wrong with that?        So what if --         All right.       So is --        What about the -- the more I listen, the more I think you think there are a lot of things people could do.         They could send three letters; they could explain in the letters why it's important to come; they could try reversing the thing a little bit with the districts first or not first -- all kinds of things. But what -- but now you re forcing them into this legal rubric.     So what about a decision, which you wouldn t like, probably, but it would say we can't say that they re unreasonable in respect to not having all of these, but there -- who knows?              You know, when they get around and others try them, et cetera. In other words, unreasonable/reasonable is one standard, and ambiguity plays a -- a role here, too, that might be helpful.
08-1423 +++$+++        And it can.     It can exclude legitimate copies before there's a first sale.       And the -- the - question is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands or falls within 106.     All right? So that's what it says.     It says -- it says it's an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute copies.     That's the 106 right.       And then 109 is an exception from 106.     So it's automatically an exception from 602.       Now, that's the text.     And therefore, you are back at what the meaning of 109 is, if I understand your argument.     And it seems to me that's the choice.     If you are going to take 109 literally, then everything that comes into the United States can't, without the permission of the copyright holder, but for the exception in (a)(3), and a library that brings them in under (a)(3) cannot even lend out the books.     That's one choice. And the other choice is to say that "lawfully made" means it's made without contravening any provision of the Act, if the Act were applicable.       What's a third choice? Maybe you want a third choice.       That's why I started with the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act.     That's all the instances where the British publisher published -- makes the book.     What they do is they have a license and they try to send it to the United States and they can't without permission because of 602(a)(1), and then 109 doesn't come into play because there's been no first sale.     That's the part of this case that I'm finding the hardest, because, literally, 109(a) -- as you correctly point out, 109 doesn't say that literally.       That's all right.       There's a whole brief filed that traces the history of that language, and I think comes to a somewhat different conclusion.     Do you want to say anything about that?     It was on the other side.       The other side, if you go to -- you go to -- go to Home Depot and buy a desk, and how do you know -- are you worried that maybe on this desk it says there was a restriction somewhere, you could only use it for homes and not for offices?     Does that kind of thing worry you?       And the reason it doesn't is because there is a first sale doctrine.     Now, aren't you importing those very things that don't worry us about Home Depot into the entire world of books, everything you are talking about?       I found the brief I was looking for which is the American Intellectual Property Law Association.     And they trace this back to Professor Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a pre-emption question, that they thought that the copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract, and State law of contract had the exception in it which applied the first sale doctrine.     Now if that's the reasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply.     We could look up what the State law is, but my guess is that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at home.       What Nimmer said is, he said we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64, '65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual restriction on the right of the owner of the particular copy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same.
08-1438 +++$+++        I was looking at the cases the best I can at the moment.     I think you might say that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word "appropriate relief" to include monetary relief.     And then there is some that don't.     And to get a rule out of them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to context.     And in context it sometimes is clear, sometimes occasionally not.     But here, isn't this and maybe this was asked, but I want your answer.     The context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both the prison situation and the land use situation, don't they?     You are given an action when the government through a general land use regulation infringes somebody's right to build, for example.     Now, wouldn't that kind of interference with the use of property quite often and normally require some kind of monetary compensation?     This isn't just the odd thing in a prison, where it's talking about it might be called building a religious building or building some kind of parking, all kinds of things that have monetary compensation.     Do you see my question?       I know, but isn't it the same word that governs both?       If it's the same word that governs both and if land cases very often involve claims for money, I would think that would cut against you. But that's why I ask.     I want to get your response.       But there are loads of cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and in those cases context makes it clear.     The only one really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems to me to be RFRA.       Uh-huh.       I mean, so often, what I'm thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't because of a land restriction.     And it turns out that that land restriction violates this statute.     And in the meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do all kinds of things that cost money.     And that's why I would think in that context money would be a natural thing.       To fulfill appropriateness.       Let me ask -- get this information from you.     As I understand it, there are some cases that find the words "appropriate relief" in a statute to include damages and there's some that don't. Let's look at the ones that don't. There is some where it's pretty hard to do it because it's in a heading called "injunction," and that's obvious.     But there are only two statutes, really, where the courts have ever held in significant numbers that the word "appropriate relief" does not include money damages.     One is the IDEA, the Disabilities Act, and the other is RFRA. Is there anything else that you've come across?       Yes, but are there any others?     I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of paper what I have to look at.       All right.     So you don't have any others, I'm judging from your hesitation.       What?
08-1448 +++$+++        Talking about common sense, why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is going to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing violence upon small children and women, and do this for an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et cetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has the right to say, parent, if you want that for your 13-year-old, you go buy it yourself.     Which I think is what they're saying.       It does, it does.     What it has is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as thoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement.     They aren't in that much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies they're talking about or other things; they're talking about video games. And both groups come to the conclusion that there is some tendency to increase violence.     And the American Psychiatric -- Psychological Association and the American Pediatric Association sign on to a long list on -- I think it's the Anderson side that this does hurt children. I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a sociological expert, I can't choose between them.     But if I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to think there's harm, the answer is yes.       Yes.     They need additional help because many parents are not home when their children come home from school.     Many parents have jobs, I -- we hope.     And -- and when -- when their children are there, they do what they want.     And all this says is, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do, parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his own, and he's 13 years old.     Now, what's the common sense or what's the science of that?       You're away from the common sense.     If you're going back to the common sense of it, what common sense is there in having a state of the law that a State can forbid and says to the parent the child, the 13-year-old, cannot go in and buy a picture of a naked woman, but the 13-year-old child can go in and buy one of these video games as I have described? I've tried to take as bad a one as I could think of, gratuitous torture of children.     Okay?     Now, you can't buy a naked woman, but you can go and buy that, you say to the 13-year-old.     Now -- now, what sense is there to that?       You mean love is not something that people have tried to encourage children to understand and know about?     I mean, what's the difference between sex and violence?     Both, if anything?       Thank you.     I understand that. (Laughter.)       All right.     So it's not susceptible.     Throughout you've been arguing your point, which is fair.     You have some experts who -- who favor you, and you make that point very strongly, and your point's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's very hard to draw this line under traditional First Amendment standards. But I'd like you to deal with their point for a moment.     And I take it their point is:     There is no new First Amendment thing here.     There is a category -- call them X -- which really are involving things like torturing children, et cetera.     Maybe you don't like to sell them to anybody.     You have them X'd or some special thing.     But they exist, and they fit within a Miller-type definition.     They are much worse than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there. And they will use traditional First Amendment tests; that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is being limited, it is being done for a good reason, compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X videos and the torture and living it through -- and there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also significantly less effective. See, I want you to deal with that directly, because what you have been doing for the most part is saying we have to be in some new, total new area, et cetera.     But their argument is you don't have to be in some totally new area, et cetera.     Apply traditional First Amendment standards, and we win.     That's their argument, and I'd like to hear what you have to say about that, specifically.       This is not an exception. It is the traditional strict scrutiny First Amendment test.       All right.     Then let's - to get you to focus on it, I'll say I've made the argument. (Laughter.)       Your answer -- your answer to the first question of Justice Alito and the Chief Justice was yes, isn't that -- that you are saying there's nothing they can do.     So now, am I right about that or am I not right?       I am right?     Okay.     All I wanted was an answer to that.       Stick to the X things, maybe.     Maybe it would restrict the total gratuitous torture.     And if that's what it restricted, why is that such a terrible thing?       And as you experimented with other things, as they did in the obscenity area, you could discover you could limit it to that.       Well, you have your rules, so why wouldn't the first step be they'd follow your rules?     Your rules.     The X things would be limited to people who are over 18, and we'll see if we ever get prosecuted for a different one.     And you might never.
08-1457 +++$+++                 To read -- you can read the language the way you want, that -- because of the vacancy clause.       You see, there is a sentence there that says "A vacancy shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise the power."                      That implies in the absence of that clause, five to four, they couldn't.     Okay? Now, you say that clause applies to the remaining members, i.e., to the three.                      And now we don't have three.    And since we don't have three, there are - and you have to have three.                Because they're not - there's not -- there are not the remaining members, you see.                As long as there was another member, you could -- you could do it.                     But without that remaining member, you can't.                Yes.             Yes.       Yes.             Yes.               Is there any other legal - this is what -- one thing, if I were thinking without the language for a moment, and I -- the Taft-Hartley Congress did, I think, want to limit the powers in a number of ways of the board, maybe expand the membership to be sure there would be both parties in larger numbers. If you could limit this to adjudications, you would say, well, then they can't set major policy with just two members.         But I don't see a way to do that, particularly since the board has often set rules in adjudication which have broad application. So am I right in thinking that we have to decide either, it is okay for two members to set the most major policies, or we have to say they can't even conduct adjudication, even the simplest adjudication, even the least significant?               No, no.          But that is a rule.   They set a rule in the adjudication -              And is it -- is it correct numerically that, in fact, under identical language except the word "and" changes to "except for," the - from 1935 to 1947, there were two-member panels and they decided about 400 cases, and then they took the same language, and now since 1947, roughly, what are the figures?    How many cases?         Has it only been this instance where it has been two members or have there been other instances?              Is that when the 400 cases that you are talking about were?              And 1947.        And how many cases were decided by two members about, I'm not asking for -- during the times you are talking about before the present two-member boards?             Well, you need the "except that" once you have language.            You need it because now you have a bigger board and it says there is a three-member quorum.             I thought they -- they simply are taking the earlier phrase, the earlier statutory phrase, and they are changing those words because grammatically you now need it?
08-146 +++$+++                Well, I thought the first issue -- I never got past the first issue.               And the first issue was, does he have a right to appeal?                And I read the statute, and to me section 16 says yes.                He asked for a stay.   It was denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an order refusing a stay.         So there's an order refusing a stay; he appealed.      Why can't he appeal?               Is there any -- is there any other example in the law -- I can't think of one -- where you say this party has so silly an argument, which is really what you're saying --              -- that we don't even let him appeal.              It seems to me I've gotten a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you can't appeal.              As to that, if you did that, I got your first point.               I understand it.         I agree with it. As to the second point, you say -- I was surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that we are now supposed to reach what we would call the merits of the appeal.       Now, there you just heard your co-counsel say:    Look, you don't have to decide whether my equitable theory is good or not.                      You haven't read the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment.                      And -- and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that two others make. The statute doesn't say he can't.                    The statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it. And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an assignment, for example, you would think, of course, there are other people, say an assignee, who could enforce it.               Your proper -- I see this is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and -- because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to enforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary.               And now what I don't know, is what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but they don't say that the individual who is asking for the stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they couldn't.   So how do we know which among all the possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should and should not be able to enforce it? Their argument is look to State law, okay? And your argument is derive some principles yourself. Really.              And so, so -- is it possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in thinking you always look to State law.                  It may depend on what the State law says.         So that's the answer to the question.   You should have had your appeal.                 Go appeal, and let the courts below work that out first, knowing that the State law is relevant but not always determinative.   Then we'll get some -- we'll get some case law on this and we'll be in a better position to figure out what the right answer is.              Well, you see it's a little hard.     I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the room drawing up the contract, they put it in the arbitration agreement.         There are four other people directly related to the room.               The parties look around and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody understands everybody is going to have to do this.                And they all say, okay, don't worry about it. Now, I would say, hey, maybe they're estopped.    And there they're going right through the contract.              So I hate to write the words "equitable estoppel is never relevant."              I would rather write the words "I'm uncertain State law is relevant policy."     You know, it's not true that it's always relevant.              What would you think about saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who are not parties to the contract can as third parties, nonetheless, enforce arbitration?                  We have listed a few examples, assignees, et cetera.                When considering whether this is one of them, judge, the key question -- we can tell you what the key question is and what it isn't.    What it is has to do with the intent of the persons who did sign the contract.              Something related to that. We don't have to be specific.                 What it isn't is a case management device.      Because what I think the temptation would be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them all off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not have to worry about this case for a while.                   And come back, and I'll figure it out.                 So is that -- is that right, or is it wrong?         What's your insight or guess on that?                 I'm just looking for ways of separating these sheep from goats.
08-1470 +++$+++           Well, Miranda does not say that.    I mean, I think -- I think that Justice Scalia is right on that, that Miranda doesn't say you can't question him.     The pages that you read to us say that if you have a lengthy questioning, then the fact that he then gives a statement cannot be taken as a -- cannot be admitted.    That's -- that's what it seems to say on page 476 --          -- in the absence of some special circumstance.          Am I right?   I mean Miranda does not explicitly say that you cannot continue questioning.     Am I right about that?          I'm asking because I don't know.     I didn't see it in the --
08-1498 +++$+++           Well, wait.      They want to apply.     They want to do --         They say in this case that they want to provide training in the issue of humanitarian international law, and they want to provide training and expert advice and assistance in respect to how you petition the UN. Now focusing on those two things, and going back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the government's interest in the following?                Under O'Brien or any other test, you look at it and say, does teaching have a First Amendment interest -- training?                Yes.   And what about teaching about advocacy?                That's what they are doing, teaching about a certain kind of advocacy. Yes.     Therefore there is a First Amendment interest implicated, seriously. Now, when that is seriously implicated, there is also a government interest, on the other side, in not having terrorism.        But there is a less restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably would believe that their teaching, assistance, training, would not significantly aid this organization in its unlawful ends, then they are not guilty. Now, what is the government's interest in not accepting that interpretation?                The First Amendment is hurt; there is an interest; but there is what they describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less restrictive way of going about it.                And they have to be reasonable in what they think.           Now, what's the objection to that?            I'm sorry.       I m not talking about tsunami aid.         I am talking about the instance where the teaching is itself teaching about how to do something, and that something is the kind of thing that the First Amendment protects.          Fine, and if a reasonable person would know that, that it's going to help them, then it is unlawful, if it's going to help them and a reasonable person would think it was going to help them in their unlawful activities.             But we're not --           Well, but petitioning the United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them -- does not, on its face, seem to me to be something that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas. Now --           -- and then Congress put a thing in here which says:       Don't construe this statute in a way that will abridge First Amendment rights.         So it's aware of the problem of First Amendment rights.           And is there any evidence that something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?          Well, in that -- on the -- just forget the harmonica for a second; I'm more worried about the lawyer.   You re saying that a -- a group abroad which may have some American citizens in it -- let's assume they do -- want to hire a lawyer.           And this lawyer is supposed to file some amicus briefs and do other activities.           You re saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute, and that's constitutional?          But I want to know if that's what you re saying, what I just said:               that an organization has American citizens, engages in terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who does legal work like filing amicus briefs.
08-1521 +++$+++            So do we read the -- the clause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we re supposed to read the words of the Constitution, aren't we? I guess --           -- the answer to that s yes. (Laughter.)           Thank you.   Very well, and doesn't that suggest what the purpose of putting the right there is even under Heller or at least one purpose --          And does that not give us a clue as to what they thought that --          -- the ordered liberty was?   That's your point?          But --          Well, suppose it is.          -- Suppose it is.      Assume for argument's sake that it is.        Still, I take from what you are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary importance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to James Madison and the other framers.            And he would say, insofar as that right to bear arms is important for the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on the ordered liberty chart.       Insofar as the right to bear arms is there to shoot burglars, it's low on the ordered liberty chart. And if that's what they d say, it's conceivable that part of this amendment would go through and be incorporated; namely, that part which would prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent they couldn't form militias.           But that part which would disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot burglars, that would not be incorporated.          Step one -- step one is make my chart.    Step two is look at what's high.              Step three is, even though that high part, even that high part, nobody could think was incorporated.          He did, actually. He did.    That's how he went about it.
08-1529 +++$+++            I don't understand your Westfall Act argument.       I must be missing something.           My understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a statute and says:     Give absolute immunity from Bivens actions. Sue the government;              don't sue the employee. It says that, basically.        A long time ago. Then, sometime after, Congress passes another statute, and in paragraph (a) of that statute, it says:   An even larger group of people, just sue the government.    And then it says:           As to this larger group of people, paragraph (1) of this statute doesn't apply to Bivens actions. So, what does that got to do with this earlier statute?     Doesn t it refer to it.           I don t -- in other words, I understand your Carlson argument. I got that one, but I don't understand this argument if I have the statutes right.           Well, is there an answer to the question?     Because that would be important.           That's your Carlson argument.    I got that one.          I understand that one. The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the Westfall Act to this argument?           Yes, right.     They give the government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1).              And then paragraph (2) says:        Paragraph (1) doesn't apply to Bivens actions. It doesn't say anything about the earlier statute.    It applies to a different group of people.               It has all kinds of requirements, nothing involved with .   Okay.    So, what is it to do with this case? Now, what I'm thinking now from your hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's the Carlson thing that is the important thing.                 Now, you tell me why I'm wrong.           You re talking about the Westfall Act.     Absolutely right.          I just say, what does the Act have to do with this older Act?         Westfall -- Westfall Act is not -- is not the FTCA, is it?         Oh, it is the -- in other words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act that gives you action against the government.         So it says the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy for all employees, but this provision which gives us an exception does not give you the exception, does not make it exclusive for Bivens actions. Okay.   You go ahead.          You explain it to me. I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen. (Laughter.)          I think his point is it doesn't matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that satisfied the second requirement of Carlson.                  That was Justice Ginsburg's first question.                And -- and there -- that's, I think, the problem for you in this case.           Can't they sue the Federal Government and collect money?           No, I mean, can't your clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their claim?           Did your clients sue the Federal Government?           Did they collect money?          No.    But if they win, will they?
08-1553 +++$+++           Then under that view, I guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United States and go on a train for 50 miles, a new bill of lading must issue?          Why?          All right, so you're saying they don't have to issue --          Fine.        If they don't have to issue a separate receipt, what we re talking about is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship.          All right.        Now, if that's correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is a person providing common carrier rail transport.                And then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad.                And my understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction if I don t -- is that the argument here is the ship is providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection with a railroad.          And it's the words "used by or in connection with" that I am focusing on, because to apply those words here seems to me to bring every international shipment in the world, no matter how small the American portion by rail and no matter how big the foreign part of this transport -- it brings it all within Carmack.     And it means that the bill of ladings issued by people throughout the world are all going to have to apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and that's going to be a nightmare.           Now, first, is it true what I said?    And, second, if it is true why isn't it way contrary to the purpose and a nightmare?          No, but why don't they have to issue a bill of lading?    That's what they say.        So every company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company, every shipowner, even if he s never been to the United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every one of those is going to have to issue a bill of lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are there, and we know at least one requirement you think applies.          Your point was --          -- if it creates such difficulty, why were the railroads in favor of it before?          Anything here that says on land?     Anything in Carmack that says on land?            In other words, if it's in a ferry boat -- remember, we have a very broad definition of "rail" where "rail" includes all things that have nothing to do with rail.            And so now we ve got that broad definition, and I would have thought we traced through what has to be in the receipt, and then we get to the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got -- want to get rid of it; then you have to put in -- you have to put in a certain kind of waiver, which is very hard to achieve. And that -- that's my understanding of it.            Yes, but they can't get rid of the thing you like.            They can?            How do they do it?          There are two things here I don't understand I'm just trying to get clear.           In the first part, 706(a), it talks about -- in the definition of "rail carrier" -- 102(6), I guess.           It says railroad includes -- railroad transport will include intermodal -- intermodal equipment transport used in connection with a railroad. What is intermodal equipment?          Okay.        So now, if we read it literally, to go back to my -- I'm trying to produce the worst example that frightens me the most.                There is 3 miles of railroad transport in the United States, but it carries the chassis, or it carries that big box, which has come all over the world, from all over the world.   And if we read this with no limitation, this definition makes the ships that carried it from other places railroads, and once that's railroad transportation, we re into Carmack. And now, if STB exempts it, what happens is the provision comes into play that says you can't exempt an exempt carrier, in effect, from the liability provisions.   And it means the ships that had to issue the bill of lading now have to allow the kinds of suits -- now, here is the point I'm not certain about -- I would think against them, not just against a railroad carrier, and perhaps against them for anything that happens, even on the ocean, and not just the railroad carrier for something that happens within the United States.          Now, explain to me is it that gets us out of that?          Yes.          Well, where does it say that?     Because I d better read that one.          Yes.     Yes.    Where?         Do you know -- do you know offhand where it says that, just so I -- I d better --          Good.          That's COGSA.       That's not Carmack.          So what gets us out of Carmack?          Then why are we suing -- why are we suing -- why does the ship being sued here?         I see.          Can we go back one more second?     Can you just give me the citation in Carmack -- not COGSA, but Carmack -- that would get our intermodal shipment out of the board's jurisdiction? Because what I'm thinking about is the intermodal shipment and the boat sinks near Hawaii. Okay?     Now, on your reading of Carmack, not COGSA, what gets that shipment sunk in Hawaii -- or Midway or Guam or someplace -- what gets them out of Carmack?         Which words?         Yes.           Yes, and it includes transport, just as you defined it, between the United States and another place -- United States and a place in a foreign country.           So that's what this is. This is a shipment between Shanghai and San Francisco or Oakland.           (a)(2).           Oh, sorry.   Between a place in -- oh, transportation in the United States.           Between a place in.           Thank you.
08-1555 +++$+++           Well, what is your --          Right.        The question I think, as I understand it, which is certainly why it s bothering me, is:   Don't think of this case.              Think of the set of cases where it's clear that the plaintiff is suing an active state.      He s suing France or he s suing England or -- he s suing an active state for an official act.   And the judge says:              I have read the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act; dismissed.               Judge, let me amend this.    And all he does is he fills in the names of the individuals, because there were some individuals who did the act. Now, does he suddenly fall outside the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act just because he listed the names of the people who did it, and everything else was the same?             Well, then, this Act does nothing whatsoever.             Well, it doesn't protect --            -- the state, because all I did there is I made my complaint the same, relief was the same, everything was the same.            I happened to go to the Internet to find out who were the human beings working for the state who did the thing I'm complaining did.             And all I did was fill their names in, in the complaint. And I cannot imagine any complaint that isn't open to that, because a -- a state can only act through an individual.           So wait --         -- you re saying this Act is only good as against a bad lawyer?              Because any good lawyer would simply fill in the right names.           There is never a case where this Act would give immunity if the plaintiff has a good lawyer.   Is that what you re saying?          Oh.    Oh, that's a different answer --         Fine.      If you re going to give that answer --         -- which I thought was what you would give --          -- then I have added my question:     Sometimes the individual, in the first set of cases that Justice Ginsburg mentioned, does count as the state.    Sometimes the individual does not count as the state.    And the trouble I'm having, in this case, is to work out the principle of when that individual would fall within the FSIA -- as you now, via Justice Ginsburg, have conceded, sometimes it does -- and when it doesn't. And I've tried to work with the idea of relief, or maybe the nature of the cause of action, or maybe the time that the suit is brought, such as a time afterwards.     I'm not an expert.           You re more of an expert than I.     What are the principles that determine when?           Then that -- I mean, I'm sort of there.   You may agree with this, that if you have an individual and with what's being charged here is he is, in fact, now acting as Secretary of Defense, and this action is an action he took in his official capacity, that's it.   Forget it.           This Act covers it. But where you re claiming it's not and he's not now a member, the reason for the Act disappears, and you go back to the act of state doctrine.           But all you have to do is write a different word in.          Now, that's the question that s --           -- and then Ms. Millett sort of backed off that.          And that -- and if -- what I'm seeing here is two extreme positions. You re saying:        Never, no matter what, can you simply write the name "Joe Smith" under the word "Niger."    Okay?   Can't do it.          Even though every act -- no matter what, you write that human name in, and you -- this statute doesn't apply.           To me, that means it never applies.    All right? The opposite would be that never, under any circumstances, can you sue an individual for a -- for a -- for an official act.         That seems the opposite.         I should think sometimes you certainly could.              Maybe after he has left the government.           But I'm looking for the principle, if I'm right, that would divide the two.            You want to stick to your extreme position?     Never, just write the thing in --             Well, do you want to stick to that position, that all the plaintiff --            -- has to do is rewrite the name?          That's an excellent reason. Can you give me one single example ever of a complaint that would ever be dismissed under this statute --          -- if -- if my lawyer is clever enough to look up who the individuals were and substitute their names?
08-1569 +++$+++           No, their -- their -- their basic argument is look at the statute.             (A) has what is undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors.             Brandishing and discharging are as traditional as they come.             Then look at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it comes.   And between those two they put (B). So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a sentencing factor, too.      I -- as I understand it, that is one of their basic arguments.
08-192 +++$+++              Why are you going through all this sort of parsing, I mean, looking at the legislative history as well as the statute in 1970? What is your answer to the last point that they made, that what Congress wanted to do was to make simple possession a misdemeanor, that's why they changed the word, which -- "offense" to "felony."                   That's why they changed the word "felony" to "misdemeanor." And I can't imagine why else they amended the statute, and just because I was curious I looked it up, and that's why they amended it, right.                   So -- so the legislative history makes that clear. So what you've done is figure out a way -- the government's figured out a way to do the opposite of what they want, to take people who simply possess and transform it into a felony.            Now, what justification is there in the law for doing that?              As to the first, I said subset.   I didn't say you undermined the entire statute. I said you took a subset of people who simply possessed and that subset you transformed into felons.               Now, your response I guess is just what you said.             -- second.                Is there another example in the law, anywhere in the law, where -- and there may be, I'm asking -- which you've come across, where we have an illegal business and there is a customer; and all the customer does is be a customer; and is there an example where just because he's a customer in a statutory provision that normally has a lesser penalty -- all right; imagine those circumstances -- you still can punish him as if he -- as if he ran the business?                I'm not aware, and why should this be the first?                The way they're a customer -- the way they're a customer is they use the telephone, and I guess one side thinks that's not a big deal, and the other side thinks that, anyway, in terms of what Congress thought, it's a tremendously big deal because Congress was really worried about telephones.             Okay, that's possible. So can you get a parallel that's like that?                What one comes to mind?                That's jurisdictional. What I'm looking for is there's a business and a customer, the statute punishes the business worse than the customer.    Now, we get the customer as if he were a business participant.       That's what I'm looking for, where it's the way he does it -- i.e., whether he uses a telephone or whether he uses a telegram or semaphore signals or -- where the -- where the means of communication here or something like that suddenly transform him? Anything else that comes to mind?              I didn't expect there to be, but I just thought maybe you would think of an analogy, which would be helpful.              Well, what about the legislative history?      Because I would read it -- and in fact what it seems to me that you're suggesting, when you read the statute, is using a telephone is -- because Justice Kennedy came up with a good example of what I was thinking of.   If the buyer sits there with a gun, well, that's different, he shouldn't have the gun, and it's not surprising that he gets a higher sentence.            And you're saying by reading the text you've discovered Congress thinks that cell phones are sort of like guns. Okay.   I grant you somebody might have thought that. Justice Souter thinks it's not intuitively obvious, but is there any legislative history that suggests that that indeed is what people in Congress thought when they passed this statute?      I'll read it if there is.              And what should I read and where exactly --             Normally, where that is involved, I've learned, it's called what Justice Scalia called it "a jurisdictional hook."                 They don't think the underlying behavior is worse, but they believe there has to be a basis and should be a basis for federal prosecution.   I started out where he was.                   I thought this is just a jurisdictional hook, but now you say no, it isn't; it's much worse than that.                    It's like carrying a gun, not quite as bad as that, but on that -- in that direction.   So I'm asking you what would I read in this history to show that what you're claiming is right?             And that's what -- you've cited that in the brief so I can find it?
08-205 +++$+++               Well, if we -- if we go -- if we go that route, what we are doing is creating an accounting industry, aren't we?             Corporations give huge amounts of money to the C-4 organization, and then somebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact that is a way of subverting the prohibition against the direct payment for the communication, right?                 Okay, so Congress said, we don't want that.                 Congress said, that's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone, for whatever reasons. Now don't we have to focus on whether Congress can say that or whether it can't?              And I don't know why it cannot say it.              That's true.             Is -- I -- I remember spending quite a few days one summer reading through 1,000 pages of opinion in the D.C. Circuit.              And I came away with the distinct impression that Congress has built an enormous record of support for this bill in the evidence. And my recollection is, but it is now a couple of years old, that there was a lot of information in that which suggested that many millions of voters think, at the least, that large corporate and union expenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate lead the benefited political figure to decide quite specifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or expending organization, the corporation or the union.             Now, it was on the basis of that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA. But we have heard from the other side there isn't much of a record on this. So, if you could save me some time here, perhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of underlying bits of evidence where there might be support for that proposition?             BCRA has changed all that.
08-214 +++$+++                Rolf was not a -- Rolf was maintenance and cure and personal injury and unseaworthiness.   So we don't know which aspect of the case led to the punitives.              Is it the case that we can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and cure?   I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.              What is your best?              So we have a history all the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two or three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't say -- leaning over in your direction, I could take maybe three or four.      And they show a little ambiguity. But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of hundreds of years of history.              With attorneys' fees there is a compensatory aspect.          The -- the basic obligation is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give him some wages if necessary, and you give him medical care.   And -- and now he's going to be out that attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness.                    So I understand that. Punitives does not compensate him for anything.   It is a policy matter for the State.                   He's a beneficiary of a windfall.          And it seems a more radical step to make something up out of whole cloth here with punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.             Maybe it would be a good thing.             The -- the problem here is it has pros and cons.      I was quite moved by the brief -- the citation that Professor Robertson made of all of those old cases until we looked them up.                   And -- and then I found they seem to stand for a little bit less than I had the impression they stood for.             So we'd be making this up out of whole cloth, it seems to me.             -- because Miles says don't do that.
08-22 +++$+++               But that isn't the only theory.     That is, in my own mind -- I don't know if you want to call it "probability" or "possibility," you don't manacle a defendant in a courtroom even though this jury may not have been affected.                     I read the opinion Justice Benjamin wrote, it was a very good opinion.     I sympathized with his problem.                  Okay?    So I'm not talking about him.         I'm talking about we don't manacle defendants because many jurors, maybe not this one, would have been adding affected, and that seems the problem here. The debt of gratitude I think, no, that isn't the theory that underlies it, though it may in part.     It's that you have here the largest amount by a factor, an order of magnitude perhaps, I mean hugely greater than any other contribution given to a judge by a single person.     It doesn't just affect the fast through gratitude.      A normal human being also thinks, if I play my cards right, maybe it will be repeated, and they'll want to keep me in office.                   And we have the fact of how it looks, and we don't have a situation where the something like this is inevitable, where you appoint judges.    It's inevitable that there will be an appointment.    I mean, hey, but that isn't true of sitting on this kind of case. So we have all those things that make it extreme.    So what is the problem?                If we say there is an envelope that the Due Process Clause doesn't touch, and that envelope is greater, and we touch less, if the States are regulating it themselves.                      Where they're not -- and this is way outside the envelope -- at that point the Due Process Clause comes into play.                      Now, end of opinion.    Now, what terrible mess will the Court get into if they write just that?              A logical principle or, I thought, if I was mentioning all those things that might lead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the past, because of the size, in the fact that it's a single individual, in the fact that there's a case coming up that's likely that the judge will decide -- all those things that are listed by the chief justices in their brief, all those things together make it a serious risk that there will be bias, even though an individual might not be.         There is a serious risk. Call it a "probability"; call it an "appearance."   Use the language that you want, but put them together, and they spell "mother."              Don't you understand what I mean?   I'm not worried about what you call "probability" --
08-240 +++$+++          So what happens -- in other words, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to clear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and horrible-smelling things all over.               And then the franchisee leaves, but the franchisor says:               Hey, I didn't want you to leave; that's your problem.                  I mean, that's constructive eviction or constructive termination?        Now suppose it's the same situation, but this person, the franchisee, being quite indefatigable and daring, finds a way of sneaking through the barbed wire that has been put up.               And there s one pump they forgot, and there s a car that comes up, and he serves that person.            Now is it constructive eviction?        No?        Objective?        You d say any sensible person would clear out immediately.            There are lions and tigers roaming the gas station. (Laughter.)        And suppose he doesn't, though, that he doesn't clear out because he's not sensible, and he just desperately needs the money.        But if they do something reasonably designed -- a reasonable person would clear out, then why not clear out?        So what's the test?        What's the test?    Because if you say we are going to give an action to a person who didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into a Federal action every single breach of contract or serious breach of contract that there is, which is the precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed this statute. So, what is your test as to we know that your case is the lions and tigers case?         I wouldn't put it that way. I d say constructive termination means you didn't terminate.     Okay?   That's what "constructive" means.          It means you didn't do it.        But sometimes a franchisor could act in such a way that the law should treat it as if he really did.      All right?          I can imagine a test for that. But we have the second problem here, is that even if the conduct was designed -- it's equal to terminating it -- this individual didn't leave.         So he was still there running the business.     That's the part I would like to test for.         No.     I want to know your test for deciding -- even though the first part is met, how you apply it when the person didn't leave?             I understand a person who left.    He left.        The franchisor says didn't tell him to leave.        And then you go look to see if the franchisor's conduct was so bad, it was the same as if you told him to leave.             I've got that part. The part I don't have is what happens if he doesn't leave?    Because one thing we know, the conduct wasn't so bad that this person left, because he didn't leave.    That's that second part that's bothering me.        I need -- the injunctive remedies in the State court?        Yes, all right.       But the reason I need a test is because the other side is saying:    I know what the test is; the test is he has to leave.         So if you -- if you can show me some cases or a test or something where he didn't have to leave, even though the franchisor's conduct was so bad that a reasonable person would have left, then I'm on to something and I know where to go.         The problem that -- that I see here is that if in fact you are right, that the -- the franchisor -- he breached the contract in your view. Did that breach rise to a termination?              Did it rise to that level? Now, it's simply a question, since he breached the contract, of what court you are going to sue in, in your view.     If this isn't a termination, you sue in State court; if it is a termination, you sue in Federal court. So, why -- why wouldn't we say, well, let him sue in State court, because if the person stays on the premises, everything becomes blurred.              If you require him to leave the premises, then it's clear.              If you were to let him stay on the premises and also argue it's a termination, we are going to have people coming into Federal court because they think there are more damages or something, I guess, or whatever reason.              There will be a whole lot of unclear cases.             So it's better to have a clear line.        You are going to say they have a right to, but the other side thinks they don't. So it doesn't answer my question to just refer to the fact that you have a right to.            My question is a practical question:     What's the harm of sticking to the clear line that is normally there in other cases, in this case not depriving your client of a remedy at all?           Just saying he goes to State court to get it.          Well, you have a choice, you know.   So, here's your choice, dealer:            Stay there and sue in State court, and by the way, if they are charging you too much money under the contract and you are really hurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they are doing, go get an injunction in State court.              See? They have injunctions in State courts.             That exists.          Or, you have the other choice.   Move out.           Then if you move out, you can sue under Federal law, and you will get all these other things like the extra million dollars or something.                 So, move out and get the extra money, or stay there and sue under State court.    Why is that a bad choice?        The theory of it is to protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a company that says, we are not going to renew your lease. And they are unreasonable, and the dealers think.         The statute says:    Fine, don't renew it, okay?      And, here, we ll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt. If you really think he's wrong, go sue for an injunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra bonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff. So we protected you a lot. Now, why should there be a third thing that the statute says nothing about, which nobody's ever heard of?    You just stay there, and you say:      I'm going to just do business every day, just like nothing happened, and I write the words under protest. I mean, why would Congress have gone to all that trouble if that's all you have to do?        No, but there is a purpose, and the purpose is that this system at least brings a judge in to see if that dealer really does have enough of a claim to get this relaxed injunction.           But your system leaves it 100 percent up to that dealer.              It could be heard of that dealer really doesn't have a good claim, and all he does is write the words "under protest."        But you don't have a judge in it, at that stage, under your interpretation.
08-267 +++$+++                Well, if that's so, then I guess you can have courts reviewing the civilians.                  They will review after the event the court-martial jurisdiction, the court-martials of people while they were in the military.      That will become a matter of course anytime.   I mean, there are many, many errors. We have approximately 5,000 petitions a year claiming some kind of constitutional error, and sometime they're right.              So that's what you foresee?              What way is it no?              Why -- in other words, in the case I posed, he would -- he -- in your view, he wouldn't have any remedy, you would agree with the government about that, if it's seven years later you find a clerical error?              Well, if, in fact, you're waiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all jurisdiction because the statute of limitations has expired, why do you need this?             Why can't they just go -- I mean, why do you need this special thing that hasn't existed for 200 years?            Why don't they just go to a civil case?   And moreover, why doesn't your client fall within that situation? You're claiming that if all the statutes have run and everything, there is no coram nobis jurisdiction, I thought in your case they had all run.               Then you're saying that what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis, indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was in it can bring constitutional challenges?               Yes, okay, and we see those every day, don't we?      But there is one difference.           The difference is that often, though not always, a person in habeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system conviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the instance that we're talking about, he can never be retried.     So in fact the difference would be, in your view, the civilians who bring this would never be retried if they're right.              And so they would have in that sense greater protection in the military system than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not always there.    Now, why would Congress have intended that?             I think you have a good answer to what my question was.               I thought that was a good answer.    It's helping me.             And -- but where I'm slightly -- and maybe this is just not relevant to this case or maybe it's for the future.                  Coram nobis, I thought, was a writ that means really like technical clerical errors or something really unusual.                Is this -- I mean, it's hardly ever there.               I've not really seen more than a handful of cases. So -- so is this writ supposed to be available for what you're claiming is what I call a typical error of inadequate representation?               And I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's -- maybe you could say that's not presented.                Maybe that's for a later case.    I don't know how to treat it.             That's why I'm asking.              I knew it was.              I thought it might be your answer:   Well, that isn't raised.               And that would be a perfectly good answer.              I'm telling you my honest problem which I'm trying to think through:               Where are we going with this?              What's going to happen one way or the other way?      That's why I asked the question. So all I'm asking is your best thought on it.                What is the theory of the jurisdiction of the military court in the circumstance where the individual is still in the military, he's been convicted, and he is in custody?                So he wants to get out of custody.    Now, what's the theory of that?                He can -- I take it it's accepted, is it, that they can, that such a person can ask the military justice system -- I don't know which court -- for release on the ground that he didn't -- wasn't adequately represented or some other ground?             All right.       It's a habeas case.   Now, do you have -- can you do that in the military?             And what's the theory of the jurisdiction that the military courts have over that?             Aiding what jurisdiction?             But they've already directly reviewed it.             So there is no more direct review to be had?             So how does this aid the direct review that is to be had, since there is none?             I see.
08-289 +++$+++ 
08-295 +++$+++               I don't think there's a notice question.     I thought there were 5,538 plaintiffs here and -- that you represent, and every one of them has already gotten money from the trust except for two who have filed claims against it.                  So I imagine if that's so, they certainly know about it.              Okay, so there is no notice problem.     If there were a notice problem I guess there would be a due process problem.                So, I don't see what notice has any more to do with this than the NCAA tournament.              Well, in the original confirmation there are problems in asbestos cases, like other bankruptcy cases, of giving people notice. Bankrupt people often give notice to many who aren't there.     And I don't know that -- maybe there is a constitutional problem with some of them, but I would have thought jurisdiction under the statute is clear.               What is -- is this about notice?               I didn't think so.          I thought this was about the case of the meaning of the words in the statute that they have authority in the bankruptcy court to issue any order, process or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the title.         And we've said that the test is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the other State proceeding -- could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy. So, as I understood it, that's the test.               That's what -- that's what this Court said.   Now, they may be few and far between, an order like this, but where there are special reasons for it -- suppose it's a pension fund and you want to reorganize the company and this is the employees' -- they're -- the employees' pension fund's worried about claims which are related directly.                 Or suppose it's an officer, or suppose it's a worker, and to reorganize the company you must cut the claims off.                    And otherwise, it is down the drain for everyone, no more money in the fund, no more jobs for the employees. Now, what is it here that would say there is no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can ever do it, no matter what?             Is what you are saying also true of the various other asbestos cases that have, I think, done this?             Well, of course, this has enormous practical impact on the debtor.                  If not him -- not this one, because it's already a done deal -- you will never get insurance companies --              -- to go into this kind of thing if they are going to be sued for the very act of helping the debtor defend the asbestos cases.              And so, I can't imagine an insurance company in its right mind going into that when in fact all these suits are still open.     That presumably is why the bankruptcy judge cut it off.               Why does it say -- it doesn't say that.    What it says in the release is it says:   We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising out of, or relating to any insurance policy. And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate to the relevant insurance policies.                      Indeed, the claims are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers to defend those very policies, given the obligation to defend Johns-Manville. So the relation is exceedingly close, and the language covers it, and there are thousands of pages of findings, I guess, that show that.                In your view, if Smith has a 2 or $4 billion claim against company X and the pension fund together, company X is in bankruptcy, and so the judge says:      "I want to enjoin this claim, we will settle it," you know, but the pension fund -- doesn't -- doesn't the bankruptcy judge -- if in fact without the pension fund you couldn't reorganize, wouldn't the bankruptcy judge have authority to cut off the claim against the pension fund? It's a question of whether the company goes down the drain or whether it doesn't.                     And --                -- the pension fund is all mixed up in this together.                No, there is nothing here in indemnity.                And that would be true of all the workforce and they have claims against the individual members of the workforce?                      They have --     it seems to me it would be an unusual case, I agree with you on that, but to say never -- to say never is what is bothering me.                Well, why not -- because there is a good constitutional protection; it's called the due process clause.         If the bankruptcy judge goes too far, it's a due process violation.                Well, there's language, broad language.              Broad language.              Who stated it?   Who stated that?    I mean, when I -- I read what the judge said at the time.    I've read language of the order, and I haven't found there anything that said that.                What it talked about was policies that were seriously intertwined with the liability of Manville.              Is this the confirmation order?              That's different.     Okay. So the confirmation order --               But there's another piece of paper called "the insurance settlement order," which says that the confirmation order and all these other definitions and the injunction just refer to derivative liability?               Yes or no?               Yes?               No?     Okay.    All right.               Well, then I don't see what has to do with it.               All right.       That's a different definition than the definition of "policy claims" in the injunction, presumably.               All right.       I have a confirmation order, an injunction.                 It defines "policy claims" in both as a lawsuit relating to any or all of the insurance policies.              And your other piece of paper says what?              You go on.       Don't worry. I'll look it up.
08-304 +++$+++              The question is, what sense does that make?   I mean -- and I thought you said that the category 1, which is the criminal proceeding, civil or administrative proceeding, I thought you said it does not apply to State proceedings in your view.           You said that was the better view.             What's the state of the law on that?   I thought it was virtually -- what is the state of the law?               I think you'd have to say that.   But -- but now, what is the state of law on that?               What are we supposed to do? I mean, to me it makes no sense.                 We are only talking about things that don't get into the newspapers.                 So -- and the purpose of the Federal Government's reading of this would be, look, we don't have people to go send around to every -- read every State report.                 We just don't have that personnel.            So we rely on these whistleblowers and we know some will be unjustified.                   I would think the same thing would be absolutely true of State criminal proceedings that don't get into the newspaper.   There are probably 50 -- several thousands -- thousands and thousands. So how to read these differently is a problem for me.   And I think that's on your side of it. But we are back to Justice Scalia's question, which to me is the -- is the question here.            Is there any history, which I pay attention to -- is there any legislative history or anything else that you can point to, to me that's important, showing that that first criminal hearing means just Federal?            And they meant criminal hearing.   Criminal hearing meant Federal criminal hearing, not State.              You say "exactly."     I was looking for the backup for that.             I just want to get your expertise on this, because you have probably read the legislative history of the 1986 amendment.                   All right, am I right in thinking this?           If I go back and read it -- which I will -- I will discover, not once in this entire 1986 history anywhere, House, Senate or conference, does the word State appear in any relevant context?             I'm not right.           Okay.   So when it appears --             What I'm -- the relevant context has to do in my mind at the moment primarily in respect to the first clause, "criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding."          Is there any indication that those were meant to apply -- any indication that those were meant to apply to State as opposed to uniquely Federal, criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings?             Yeah.        Clear from the record -- clear that --               And the word hearing --              There is one ambiguity whether this clause, the first -- what we call first and second refers to State as well as Federal.                      If the debate took place in a context where everyone's just thinking of Federal, it's not surprising they didn't put in the word Federal.       They don't think of everything. All right.    Now, that's my question. You started with the House.                    The House to me does think just of Federal.             The Senate's ambiguous on that point --             -- and the conference is yet more ambiguous on that point.                  So is there anything -- when I look at the conference and the Senate versions, I'm going to say, gee, they did -- sorry, they did actually think of Federal and State, too, and it's sort of mixed up?     Or am I going to see that that context there is Federal?
08-305 +++$+++                 What about more than that?                Why not -- I mean, suppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute, which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the help.   It seems to me that (a)(10) large (A) and then (F) have something to do with the parent who never goes to public school, the child just goes to private schools to begin with, and they get something.                   If they have -- if they have a disability, this program pays them something, right.                It's at the very beginning, at the end of addendum page 1.                What is that?             All right.       So in other words --             -- a parent who has a disabled child who never thinks about the public school system still gets some money, but not as much, for the disabled child?             It's money to the school.             To the school.             And so, it's money that goes to the school for a program?             Money that the children can get.   I get it.              All right.       Now, would it then work, what is -- would this system work under the statute?     You say, parents, if you are going to a disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you get the services you just mentioned. Now, if you put in -- put the child in a public school, and they find a free appropriate public education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do it.     Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can, you can send the child to a private school, but it has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school system. Now, that's what you don't want the interpretation to be?         You don't -- you are against that.     But -- but let's amend it a little.              I am reading the language. You may require the district to pay for someone who has been enrolled in special services --              You haven't heard my amendment.              My amendment is the norm will be give the public school a shot, but there could be circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there is need to put that child in a public school now.                  In other words, special equitable circumstances that make it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a shot, though that's the norm.               And in those unusual circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable relief. What about that as an overall interpretation of the statute which has several parts to it?              But you have to be willing to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the parent where that parent didn't give the public school a shot.     They will have to show there is a good reason for not doing that.               Is that all right with you or not?               Well, you are simply saying that it was reasonable for the parent here.               I'm not asking that question.
08-310 +++$+++                That's a different argument.   Can we just get to --              That makes matters worse.              Let's suppose I accept just what Justice Ginsburg said, and said it's a hopeless morass if we look at all taxes.             Let's look at this tax. This tax you call an ad valorem tax on personal property levied by Valdez, and then on page 11 of your brief you say that's not just on ships, it's also on mobile homes, trailers, recreational vehicles, and various types of personal property defined under State law as oil and gas property, motor vehicle, machinery, supplies and maintenance equipment. They come back and they say, as to your mobile homes, trailers and recreational vehicles, all that's happening there is either you have exempted them or they are fixed in place, and they are like real property and that's what you are doing.                As to the other things, you do not impose a tax on those other things. Rather, the State imposes a tax on those other things. And it may be that you help the State do it by providing them with the assessment, and it may be even that you could do it, but you haven't; and therefore, the only thing you have imposed this tax on are the ships. Now I think I have that argument right.                If I do, what's the answer to it?             If I don't, what's the right argument?             May impose doesn't help if you don't do it.             State imposes it or --              And that happens with all these other properties?          That is, in Valdez, you pay the city -- you pay the city -- for the -- for the taxes on that oil and gas property that isn't shipped?              And you write the check to the city.              All the things you listed on page 11 --              The -- the oil and gas, motor vehicles, machinery, appliances, supplies, and maintenance equipment.               So they write a check to the city.   Okay.              What about a porthole tax?             Is a porthole tax in your view okay?             A porthole tax.     They charge for portholes.       Anyone who has a porthole who comes into our city pays taxed.                That's not a tonnage tax.             So, in your view, a masked tax.             Oh, but the porthole tax applies, by the way, to that ship's captain who has retired, who has built his house with portholes instead of windows. (Laughter.)             So there are 2 or 3 percent of the -- I mean, it's only 99.9 percent on ships.             Yes.               What about the Greer?         You haven't mentioned that.         Greer in Norris v. City of Boston.   Where he says the -- you know what it says; it's on the front page of their brief.                   All right.   That seemed to me to say, don't interpret the Tonnage Clause to apply to tonnage.       Interpret it, same thing as if it was mass, it's mariners, power of the steam engine, number of passengers, the master or owner of the vessel -- all those fall within the Tonnage Clause. That's what the paragraph seems to say.
08-322 +++$+++             So what is the reason in your opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence or two, you would say that the reason that Congress didn't go into other States and decide which ones to add to this or go into these States district by district and decide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that Congress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply renewed it?              Thank you. I have another question.                    How long did it take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?              And how long would it have taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the record to figure out what's happening in this respect in every State or in these States district by district?
08-351 +++$+++           But if I have a different position, which is I d like to see if it's practical to decide this case now, two things stand in the way in my mind which I d like you to address.           The first is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really address this issue now because there are three Illinois statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it, a right to a hearing at least on probable cause.               And that's a matter of Illinois law.            And although the statutes don't seem to say it, they might. And the second is that this seems mixed up in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate questions:    when you are entitled to a final hearing of whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car. Now, that latter question I think might be impractical in many cases to work out until there's been a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which may be much later. But the former question is where I think you have a point, that there are five instances here in this statute where a policeman could seize a car without a warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of them nonetheless.    So your clients might say:         He did not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to contest it. Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a different question than the final hearing about who's entitled to the car.     And I also see the three statutes and now I see a case where here in front of me everything is mixed up.       So I think -- perhaps I'm just seeing it that way, but those issues are mixed up confused and not separated out.             So why don't we wait?     What's your answer now?          Okay, can we --          Go ahead.    Finish.            Well, can I get to the merits for a second?            Go back to what Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor were asking.             This statute gives a policeman the right to seize some property without a warrant if it's a circumstance where you could seize a person without a warrant. That s basically what it says, doesn't it?          All right.       In that kind of situation, I would think maybe you are entitled to a quick hearing where the only subject would be:               Was that language carried out?   Was that policeman right?             Was there probable cause, or wasn't there? Now, if that's the issue, I don't see why you give up at all on the baseball card.             I mean, if somebody comes into my house and takes a baseball card, and he's supposed to have probable cause and he doesn't, I don't see why I can't go get a judge or a magistrate, determine whether he had at my baseball card, and pretty quickly, too.          But if you go to the other --          If you go to the other, which is whether there s an innocent owner or whether in fact you should give bail to the property -- I mean, that's -- I know we give bail to people, but I don't know that we give bail to property.             Maybe real property, but that seems a much more complex argument. So I want to know:         What's your authority that we should give bail to the property and have a hearing on that?           And why do you give up in respect to baseball cards or anything in effect to the first?
08-441 +++$+++               Would you --              Would you think you should have the burden in the following situation?               At 10:00 o'clock on March 21st the employer says:               I am going to get rid of Smith because he's too old.              That's it.       Writes out the letter, "Good-Bye, Smith."         An hour later someone walks into the employer's office and says:                    "I've discovered that Smith was just convicted of larceny."                    All right? Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old.                    But I take it he can make the defense:                 Well, Smith would have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired him, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get off.   But he should make that defense, shouldn't he?              Fine.       So the answer is yes?              All right.         So now we have the same situation, but the jury has said this bad reason, his age, was a motivating factor.              To me -- it didn't say played a role.              Well, what it says in this instruction that I have -- I don't see the other one --              Well, I have on page 7 of the -- of appellant's brief that the instruction was "the plaintiff's age was a motivating factor in defendant's decision."               Now when I read that, I think --               Yes.               Fine, okay, all right, fine.               Fine.       It played a part. It did have a role:     Age motivated in part.              Now why isn't that the end of the matter?                Because we have a statute that says age shouldn't play a role in.                   "Play a role" means it made a difference.                I mean, to me. Otherwise it played no role.              It was an understudy, a ghost.     It "played a role" if it would have made a difference.     "Played a part," it would have made a difference, just like my first case. So we have an action, other things being equal, that should be illegal under this statute.                  But then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a defense:     If you can show that in the absence of that age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway, which means the mix of motives would have been different, then you get off. So, if in the first case we in fact say it should be on the -- burden should be on the employer, why shouldn't it be in the second case?              Will you --              Will you go back?          I'm sorry to be hung up on this point.                   Maybe there are 15 cases that just prove I am wrong.                      But I'm -- I'm trying to figure out -- let's try other areas of the law.     The dam is a nuisance.           We now show, to prove that it's a nuisance, that it played a role in the death of my fish.     I mean, isn't that the end of the case? Damages might be at issue -- how much of a role -- but as far as liability is concerned the gears were rusty. The rusty gears played a role in the derailing of the train.     Again, it might be a question of who is responsible for what, but that there is liability I think in most areas of tort law would be over once you prove that the defendant's factor played a role.               So is the law here -- am I wrong about ordinary tort law?                Possibly.   I don't know it that well.     Is it that I -- is it that this area is special?    Is it that there are cases so you can say any of those three?     I am prepared to be totally wrong.              I hope not.               You can say that.               And I think "played a role" combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't know --               -- if you have to --               "Played a role" -- how did it play a role if it was not a necessary?
08-453 +++$+++               Can I -- can I take what Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that I am interested in your response to? I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney General.    Is the whole thing in the record?              Okay.       Now, reading Judge Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he had said was that there are statistical disparities between interest rates and race.                Well, as long as, most unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with minorities being towards the bottom, of course such statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, some not.   So if the only basis for getting this information is that allegation, it's hard to see how this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.              But it might be quite a different case, if they had gone into court and found individuals who were really getting different interest rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for race.   But at that point, they'd have to go get this same information, because that's where they would find whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.                 Do you see what I'm doing?                 I'm dividing the matter vertically, instead of, say, horizontally --                 -- and I want to know if that's possible.
08-472 +++$+++             I see what the judge did. He said:   The motion to enforce the July 24th injunction is granted.    He said:     Buono's motion to amend it is denied.    Then he did two other things, which he listed some people and he said they are enjoined from implementing the law. Now, I take it that those paragraphs 3 and 4 are an implementation of the July 24 injunction which he granted, not a new injunction.            So that's the issue here that we were just possibly debating.                    The issue in the case is whether the district judge might lawfully enforce an old injunction in the manner he did, which was to add paragraphs 3 and 4.              That question you concede is here.
08-479 +++$+++                I mean, I think there's a dispute in the record about that.                  So -- so we have, I mean you would have the right to prove your version, obviously.   But suppose you fail to prove that and that the jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact, concludes the school board's right on that; all they did was ask her to strip to her underwear, period.                  Nobody saw anything else. Now, what's your view of that one?                 I mean, let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove -- to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette lighter, and a cigarette.             And who gave you the planner? Well, Savana gave it to me.               And they find some pills. Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like meth or something.       And she says well, where did you get those?     Savana gave them to me. Okay.    That seems to be possibly reasonable suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills.                    And they're going to distribute them at lunchtime.                    At that point they go look, whatever they did here.                   But then they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the female official say:         All right, Savana, strip to your underclothes and shake your underclothes.                   That's what happens, period. Now, is that latter part a violation of the Fourth Amendment?               Because?               All right.       But it would be okay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym clothes?    Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker, they're about the same size, shape; go do that.               No, they didn't -- she didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes.              She -- that's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out here, because I'm not certain.               I'm trying to work out why is this a major thing to say strip down to your underclothes, which children do when they change for gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and there are only two women there.              Is -- how bad is this, underclothes?   That's what I'm trying to get at.               I'm asking because I don't know.              Well, I thought there was, because I thought on page 135 of the record the official said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that there was --              My question -- my question has to do with accepting --              What they said on page 135 of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having. I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it -- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat it.              Okay.       I want to know why that search, if that's what happened, would violate the Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.              Maybe the psychologists -- "strip search" has a lot of meanings.                   And do the psychologists focus on the situation with the child involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is that what they're talking about?               It's not like you have any studies on this.      But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent child has some pills or something, they know people are looking for them, they will stick them in their underwear.    I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean, somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for some adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I don't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?               Do you have any studies on this?   I doubt it.              Or not my underwear. Whatever.     Whatever.     I was the one who did it?                   I don't know.     I mean, I don't think it's beyond human experience, not beyond human experience.              Well, what are they supposed to do?              No, no, but it's supposed to be what's reasonable.

08-5274 +++$+++              There is another --             What would you think -- to go back to Justice Stevens' question, I would start with the assumption that, normally, not always, where you have a criminal statute and the crime has elements, that Congress intends that the elements be carried out with a guilty state of mind; I would start with that assumption. Now I would agree with you that sentencing is different, and the reason that it's different is because sentencing often goes up or down depending upon whether the harm that is foreseen does or does not occur, irrespective of the state of mind.                 So we couldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view.              Now -- now, having done that I wonder if the background rule should come into play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there are many ways in which the sentence will go up.                  If this person had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder in the course of a felony.         There are all kinds of other statutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't apply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give him the higher sentence, if he warrants it. But if you apply the mandatory minimum where the judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to take people who the judge and others think fall into the minimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and force them to have a higher sentence.                  Now, that would be a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum sentencing matters.              Yes, it would.         It would.              No, I can't -- I can't -- the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of this that really says why they use "is discharged" or used "as opposed to discharges."               And I find those very metaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see either something in the history or some functional consideration.               "Carries," what about "carries"?   If a person is carrying the gun in his pocket but he doesn't know it, which could happen, does that fall within "carries" or not?               So is he guilty of the first; do we know?              The carrying has to be -- although the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the carrying has to be in relation to the crime.              I thought it just said "who in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."              No, it's a "carrying."             My -- my interest is the -- whoever, blah, blah, blah, for which the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a firearm, or who in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm.      So I thought that the "in furtherance" does not modify "carry".              Okay.              So, you know, what happens if the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the firearm in his pocket and doesn't know it?                       He picked it up from the tailor, and now is -- is there an intent requirement there?       Do we know?            Did Smith talk about that?   Do we know?      I mean is there, you know, a state of mind requirement?                 Smith says "in relation to" and so the carrying has to be in relation to.                       And since the carrying has to be in relation to, that pretty much --                 -- covers the state of mind.               I think I got everybody mixed up, because the first sentence of the statute is on the preceding page.       And if I start at the beginning, I would discover -- of my memo -- if -- it says, if -- in -- who -- any person who during and in relation -- during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, blah, blah, blah, of a certain kind uses or carries a firearm.               So there it is right there, or who in furtherance of such a crime possesses shall be sentenced.   Okay.    So we've got the during and in relation to covering the whole bunch.                     Then we have to read that into little (ii) and little (iii).               Yes, exactly.               Then we have to read that by implication where it says if the firearm is brandished during or -- you have to imply that.               Yeah, that's not your argument?               Forget it. (Laughter.)
08-538 +++$+++           Do you have any sense of how it works in practice?       I'm a little worried by Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says in practice what's been happening is that in most places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork. The impression I had from reading Collier, and it was -- the opposite was so, that normally when you have the creditors  meeting, things would appear, what was a problem or what wasn't, and the creditor would then file an -- or the trustee would then file an objection.   Well, what is the case?             How does the practice work?   I'm -- I m pretty uncertain.             I'm not a bankruptcy expert.           Yes, but how did it work normally for years and years?             You'd go into a committee meeting of creditors.       They'd get into an argument about the valuation.     I'm sure that happened.           And when that happened, did trustees file objections within 30 days or didn't they?           How do we know that?      I mean, I was impressed by Ambro.            Isn't he the judge here?           He had been a bankruptcy judge, so maybe he knows.           Now, I don't know who knows, because I'm worried the government has looked into this, and somebody's telling them who knows it's the opposite.          I'm very confused because of your answer to Justice Sotomayor.            I thought what you were saying -- she said, well, you only have 30 days; you get all this value.     That doesn't say very much. You said, well -- you -- you said less.            Okay?          You said less time. Which isn't much of an answer, but it's something.                Now, I would have thought you were going to say but it's 30 days from the creditors  meeting ending, and that's a movable feast that could last 5 years.              You could keep postponing it.     You can go to the judge and say, Judge, give me an extension, which he'll do.              So there's no problem here.     But you didn't say that. So the fact that you didn't say that suggests to me you're not certain about what this practical impact is.          You are certain?          All right.     How long do these creditors  meetings last?              How easy are they to postpone?    How -- how easy is it for the trustee to get this information together during the creditors  meeting, et cetera, et cetera?       Where do I look to find out the answer to that question?
08-586 +++$+++             Suppose you were appointed to a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful. I'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as I am satisfied with your results. Now, would you, for example, not have in your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other people that don't have someone like me setting his pay? Wouldn't that be in your mind?            Yeah, so wouldn't that be a normal question to ask?                I think we are reviewing a -- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard, and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn, but we would like to know what he charges when he asks for money from people who do not have this kind of supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different to ask him why.                Okay, so what's the problem then with saying that in the opinion?                Well, it's pretty unusual that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the case in front of us a case where it would be relevant. You may have an answer to the question.                  There may be a perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.             The answer dispositive? Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the answers would be quite different.             All right.       So -- but you no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an issue.   There might -- I mean, maybe there is some. That's the only issue, whether this should be dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to take into account where relevant?             So you have no objection to send it back and say look, of course this is relevant, perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?            What do we do about Gartenberg?    That is to say, the key sentence you can read either way.    The key sentence could mean -- it just depends on tone of voice.          You must charge a fee that is not so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not -- could not have been the product of arms-length bargaining.        Or you could say, look, it's unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where there is no reasonable relationship.                    And if there is no reasonable relationship, how could it have been the product of arm's-length bargaining?            You object if we turn them upside down?            Well, I'm saying the tone, be a little careful here.            So we can say the substance is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if it's not reasonable, how could it be?                    Got to get an answer to that, okay?       So, that way you see the tone is be careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter. How's that?
08-598 +++$+++               It's not reopen -- it's -- it's the same problem.         And maybe you found some authority to the contrary, other than statements, but actual authority.     The defendant loses.                He appeals.     He says they made a mistake.            And the normal remedy is you give him a new trial.         Does it matter that it's a collateral proceeding?         I don't think so.            They go to the Federal court:      Judge, they made a mistake at my trial.     You give him a new trial.               Everything's up for grabs normally at the new trial.                 I can't think of an instance where it isn't. Here, they are saying:                 Judge, they made a mistake.     They should have applied the mental retardation rule of Atkins.              So give him a new trial. Now, what I'm looking for is just one example somewhere that supports you --              -- that didn't proceed on the theory I've just announced or just said.               No, I want a case even vaguely like that. (Laughter.)              Your argument, then -- we're getting somewhere maybe.              You're saying to me, think of Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral proceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't enough evidence to convict him under the Constitution, like the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough evidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial.                 The Constitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore there is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy Clause, right?              All right.       So you're saying here, the evidence the first time was such that they couldn't give him the death penalty under the Constitution as later interpreted.                 So if that's what you discover on the collateral appeal, a similar reasoning would somehow lead you to the similar result. Is that the argument?
08-6 +++$+++                  Well, he just --                 Well, why isn't that the end of this case, because I heard opposing counsel say if you go tomorrow and file a piece of paper and swear on that piece of paper you're innocent, Alaska will give you the DNA.     Isn't that what he said?                 I heard him say that, I thought.                 Well, if he said it in this Court in answer to a question, I don't see why that isn't binding.                 Well, wait.        What I heard was that if your client files a piece of paper that says, I am innocent, then under this new procedure, which apparently I hadn't read about because I didn't find it or it wasn't obvious in the brief, that then they will give him the DNA.              Now that's either right or it's wrong; and if it's right, I think that's the end of it, and if it's wrong, well, then we'll have to proceed. But I would proceed on the basis that this swearing requirement is not sufficient.              Could you say this -- could you say, suppose -- I'm just testing this out -- that like any other governmental action, this action of refusing the DNA evidence is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement that there be a reasonable basis?   Can't be arbitrary.              Now, withholding DNA is a governmental action, and so you cannot do so arbitrarily.    If you were to do so simply because the defendant would not sign a new complaint under this new procedure, which I somehow missed in the reply brief, that's a good basis for withholding it.                    He should be willing to do that. If the reason they won't give him the DNA is because before the parole board he said he was innocent, that, to me -- not to others but to me -- that would mean nothing.    Of course, he's going to say he's innocent.    He doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.    Okay? So, I -- I would say, but not maybe others would say, that if that's their reason for not giving it, I'd hear further argument, but that would be arbitrary.    But if their reason for not giving it is just because he won't file a new piece of paper in which he says he's innocent or there's nothing to lose there, then I think the State's being arbitrary.                   Okay? Suppose we said that:                  The rule is non-arbitrary with illustrations, send it back to the States.   And of course when they apply their own statutes, by and large they're not being arbitrary.              Well, it does help you win. (Laughter.)              Yes.
08-604 +++$+++              I take it your point is that there is a rule?        It's called 29 CFR 301.7(b).              If that rule happened to say, you must show up by 11, that would be a fair inference you don't have to show up by 10.     And that rule says you have to submit the argumentative facts, so there is a fair inference you don't have to submit the facts that are not argumentative. I take it that that -- suppose that you are wrong -- suppose that you are wrong on that.                 I think maybe you are right, but suppose you are wrong.                    Suppose they have loads of authority to make rules.                 Again, you have a strong argument they don't, but suppose they did. In your research -- and the same question is really addressed to your fellow counsel.                 In your research on this, did you find any instance in which either a court or an agency does change a rule, and says:     Now you have to say the date right underneath the caption, whereas previously it was stamped by the clerk. Okay?     They changed the rule.           And they have every good reason in the world for doing it.                And then they apply it to the case in front of them, which didn't know about it, and then they won't let them change it. Now, is there any case at all which said that that was lawful?      I can think of lots of cases that say you cannot apply rules retroactively where it is unfair to do it, even if you had have all the power in the world to make the rules.            I have lots of cases like that.   What I wondered is if anybody found a case along the lines that I just said.               And because -- I mean, in the normal --
08-6261 +++$+++              So in other words, if, in fact -- you agree or don't agree, I don't know -- but the government says and they say, the government of the United States has here -- and it can, under the Constitution, delegate to a private person the authority to prosecute.             There is a big argument against that.             The argument is would be the one person you can't delegate it to because they are very biased.              And that argument, you say, is not in this case.              Okay.       So now we have what is in the case, which is the question of whether, leaving that argument out of it, did they hear or -               It's highly relevant, I think, because I think you would you like to make the argument, which I would like to hear, is that:              Forget the United States.      The Constitution permits this woman to bring the case as a private citizen.               Now, if you are right about that, the plea agreement drops out.               Because nobody says made a plea agreement with her.          Because that is the argument you want to make at some point. (Laughter.)               What do we do about that? Because it's very hard for me to focus on the case - the issue you want me to decide -                -- without thinking about the one you don't.               And the reasons, as I have categorized this -- the -               So what do --- so what do we do?   I mean, I think of this as like Aeschylus; you have the Furies gradually giving way to justice.               I mean, private -                -- vengeance is out and justice is in, and we have 3,000 years of that, and they are all going to be variations of that theme and we could think of 100 arguments.             Boasting.        Then is this special?             Well, before I can answer that question, I would like to know whether the government could appoint the private person.                   After all there is a check -- there is a check against the total Furies, it's the government doing it.                   Now you say no, the government can't do it, so -- but they can do it on their own.   Maybe -- I don't know.             How do I get my -- how do I begin to answer these questions bound together in my mind in some partial way?             But you want to do that. You see, so there is no control.                 You are saying we want the private individuals to have the authority to bring criminal contempt; they are on their own; they decide it.   The government has nothing to say about this.                It's a totally private matter.             All right.        Now the State of California, trying to save money, say we have a very good idea.   We are going to pass one law, abolish all the prosecutors' offices and say wherever there is a victim of crime, that victim will bring the prosecution. Now you really are back to the Furies.                  Is that constitutional?             You would say that that is constitutional -               -- to have a statute that all criminal prosecutions would be brought by victims, period?             All right.       If there are, then why aren't there the same here?             You might -- you might - you might say this.      To answer your question that is here, there are a couple of ways of doing this.                   One way you would say is, well, don't worry about this so much. If the answer is no, you can still bring your private prosecution but you have got to get government permission, because you are doing it in the way of the government. But if the answer to the question is if you can't do either, they you might say, then why wouldn't you say why well, aren't we back to the Eumenides, and the answer is going to be this is say contempt. Contempt is special. I don't know whether either or both of those ways would work.   So what would you think, since the government has changed its position, of sending this back so some of these things can be worked out?                 At least we would have some opinions that would help us.               Oh, well, that's a different matter.               That's -- that's -- why isn't it a different matter?               Okay, so now you are into the question of what counts as a prosecution.               And there again, I am at sea.   I don't know what the authority is.             I accept that -              Is there somewhere I can look to see what happens?           All I can find in the long law is that a violation of the order is a contempt. Fine; no problem.    And then the only word about the Petitioner, it says the Petitioner is entitled to relief under this chapter, which contains about 50 different things.   And it doesn't say what kind of relief.               It doesn't say how you get relief.                It doesn't say if you are just asking -- all those things you raised.                So how do I find out actually what is in the system.              It doesn't say that.     It says the earlier part of this statute which goes on for six pages in an earlier part of this statue, which goes on for six pages, seven pages.               It says, a Petitioner has a right to seek relief under this subchapter. Now, that contains civil contempt.                    It contains how you get protective orders.                     It contains a lot of things that are absolutely noncontroversial.                     So I am trying to figure out:            What is the system?                Is your argument the broad argument that the Chief Justice was talking about, that we have a man who drives in a car from Baltimore to rob a bank in Washington and the U.S. Attorney in Washington gives him a piece of paper which says, I will not prosecute you for this now or in the future, and suddenly the U.S. Attorney in Baltimore prosecutes it. Are you saying that that is barred or not barred? That's the broad argument.              Or are you making a narrow argument?              Well, I'm just asking you your position on that.        Can the -- does this piece of paper from the U.S. Attorney in Washington bar prosecution by the U.S. attorney in Baltimore?                    Yes or no?              It does bar?
08-645 +++$+++            So if I -- if I think, as Justice Alito was starting out, that if the -- a court order in the divorce case says the father and mother will jointly decide what house to live in, that the father has a custody right, if it jointly says the father and the mother will decide what State to live in, that that's a custody right.             That it says that the father and mother will decide what city, same. The father and mother will jointly what country to live in, same. But suppose that there is no such decree; rather, the jurisdictional statutes of the nation, without considering this family, have a rule that says they have to live in Chile without Court permission. Is there any way I can draw a line, in terms of this statute, between the two situations, the one being where the divorce judge actually focused on the needs and circumstances of a family, the other being where there was no more than a jurisdictional law in a nation that tried to protect the jurisdiction of its courts?           I understand that, but what I'm wondering is if -- if -- I thought you would agree with me about that, and since I thought you would agree with me about that, you would explain to me how I could reach that result, consistent with the language of this convention, which talks about custody rights granted by operation of law.           Who's against it?   I -- as I read their brief, France is not on their side.            It's split.           Canada is on your side; that the House of Lords is -- has some dicta written by two judges, which is good, but it wasn't a holding in the case.           And -- and that's about it, and so maybe they --           Germany.           Who do you count for you of the seven, just so I can write it down and go back and read them?     Any one of the seven for you?           Which?           Okay.      Any other for you?           Canada.          Okay.   And who's against you?           No.     I asked who is against you.           You think one against you, one for you, the rest unclear?           Okay.           How old is the child?           Why didn't your client just ask the judge there to leave Chile?
08-651 +++$+++           Why -- why do you have a rule?     I mean, I thought -- I ve looked up six cases, and they all say, Strickland cases in this Court, that you look at all the circumstances.                 Now, what I think is radical on your part -- but tell me it isn't -- is not what the rule is, but that you want one. I thought the government's view normally was the same as we -- what's the exact words -- did the conduct of the lawyer meet professional -- prevailing professional norms?     And then we look to see, if it did not, whether that led to a situation where he would not have pleaded guilty but for the failure.               Okay? Now, the world is filled with 42 billion circumstances.   If we agree with you, we will have set in motion the great legal rule machine.               And there's nothing better than lawyers spinning off rules.                And we will be here from now until -- good, we won't have any docket problem, because what we'll be doing is reviewing rule after rule after rule after rule. So why has the government -- I think for the first time, maybe not -- told us to abandon Strickland's approach and start spinning off rules?            No, no.      But it's easy -- I mean, you know one thing we are very good at here is making up hypotheticals.        So I imagine it wouldn't be that tough for me to think of a hypothetical where everyone knows this 90-year-old individual who has actually never set foot in the country that he came from, and everyone knows that if he pleads guilty to this chewing gum offense where they have virtually no evidence, he will be sent back, at age 90, to that country. I would say any lawyer would say, be careful, because if we plead guilty, back you go, on the stretcher since you can no longer walk.          See, all I did was spin out a hypothetical. And the reason I can spin those out and why we have the Strickland rule is pretty clearly that you shouldn't have sub-rules here because life is more complicated than rules tell us.         Just look to see prevailing norm and did it cause the harm.         And that's why I am back to my question:          Isn't this the first time the government has asked us to adopt rules under Strickland rather than what it says --          -- which is "case by case," underlined, italics, repeated in the cases?          No, no, they are not asking us to have a rule.     What he is saying is, look to the individual case and ask in this case, did the -- at least that's what I heard him; he's in charge of his own case.   But I heard him say, look to this case, and in this case, it falls below prevailing norms for a lot of reasons.          Suppose a -- a client comes in.   You are a criminal lawyer and you learn the facts of the case, and it turns out that, after listening to the facts, you think he is being charged with a fairly minor offense, a year maybe max, and he tells you:                   You know, I have a family here, I've -- I've -- you know, he tells you this story where it is quite apparent to you that if he pleads guilty, back he goes, where he might be killed and so might his family.               Just sit there and say nothing?   What would you do?           Yes.           What would you do?         I'm asking you, would you tell him?            He doesn't know about the immigration law.     He thinks it's just a year.             You yourself have learned that he probably will be killed, as will his family, if he pleads guilty.              Would you tell him that?           Of course you would.         And do you think of any -- can you think of any decent lawyer who wouldn't?           No.    Okay.   Then why have you -- in this case, if they didn't tell him, why has not such a lawyer failed to meet prevailing professional norms in my hypothetical?           Oh, I'm not saying whether -- you have just told me that any lawyer worth his salt, in my example, of course would tell the client, and  - in my case.   And so I just asked, then has a lawyer who has failed to do so not met the prevailing professional norm?   That has nothing to do with ethics or not ethics; it's how lawyers behave.       I don't see how you avoid answering that question "yes".           You just told me everyone would do it, everybody'd do it.            I don't know what a norm is otherwise.          Before we get to the misadvice, to put every -- dot every  i,  every lawyer would do it in my case; that's a professional norm.           If a lawyer fails to do it, he hasn't met the professional norm.   And a rule that's absolute would overturn Strickland in that respect, because Strickland says if you fail to meet professional norms, you are guilty of inadequate assistance of counsel, okay?           So Q.E.D. Now, what s wrong with what I just said?
08-660 +++$+++              What's -- what about the case that they were talking about, so the relator's pursuing a case, that case is over, and they're not going to appeal because they don't have any money left, whatever it is; but the government looks at that judgment and thinks, oh, God, there's something wrong with this one, I better appeal it.                That's the government lawyer speaking. Now, they're supposed to have 60 days to figure that one out, and you'll take that 60 away from them because they'll have to do this whole thing in 30.             No, because they didn't expect --              The judge did -- the judge did a surprising thing, which judges sometimes do.              Would this be a solution which wouldn't help you?         You would say, well, there's some factors here cut one way, and there's some that cut the other way, and some circuits have said the government should have the 60 days, and those cases are already proceeding.     So it's best to keep it where it is, which is 60 days, and then suggest the Rules Committee look into this, since we don't actually --              And it -- all right.      And the Rules Committee would looked into it if it's a problem.              Well, I know.    That's repeating your argument.         And I'm suggesting what would be wrong with the view that you lose because of the reasons I said.
08-661 +++$+++            The problem, as I see, for you in this case is that the basic conclusion is in the court of appeals, where it says:               "Viewed in this light, the NFL teams are best described as a single source of economic power when promoting NFL football through licensing."     Well, how do we know that?           Their allegation is that that isn't true.     And I have -- and Copperweld just seems to me to be very confusing on this, since -- since my hornbook knowledge of it was we have Copperweld to deal with the case that we don't make booths in department stores compete in price against each other.    All right? Normally, however, we say independent vendors can't get together and say they fix prices. That's per se.     And joint ventures are in the middle, so we apply a rule of reason. Now, very simple.           I thought that has been the law since Panagra.        I don't know what, in fact, Copperweld has to do with it.              And they are saying that this basic joint venture for promoting is not a reasonable agreement.        So why shouldn't they have their shot?   You might well win, but they want to make that claim.           Fine, but that's the conclusion here.     That's not the -- that's the conclusion.   The question is:             Should they be permitted to join their centers of economic power into one when they promote and sell their T-shirts, sweatshirts, et cetera?           Now, you can't answer that question by announcing the conclusion.           Well, can't it ask someone to do that? Oh.   Oh, you are saying the game.           What does a game to do with this?     I thought we were talking about T-shirts and helmets, and I -- I thought it's the simplest thing in the world.     You pick up the phone and say:                Hello, Shanghai, do you have a helmet? (Laughter.)           This is a summary judgment motion?          But now the question is Are you basing that on economic-related data about the pros and the cons of -- you know, the economic harms of stopping them from competing versus the economic benefits of allowing them to act as a separate -- as a single entity?    Or are you basing it on a pure legal word called "single entity"? And what worried -- I thought when I read the opinion, first, of the district court, that he's just following what I think started in the Seventh Circuit, unfortunately, of taking this word "single entity" and throwing around -- throwing it around all over the place and stopping the economic analysis. But then when I read the last paragraphs of his opinion, he seems to be saying, when I go back to the record, which you want me to do, I will discover that there is lots of information showing economic benefit to this venture of promoting together. There's nothing to suggest they could compete, and so it's clear, to the point where they don't get to trial, that this is a reasonable agreement. All right.      Now, is -- have I -- am I right in thinking what you are thinking?           All right.         Good.   Then I want to know what your position is.           Yes --           Well, I wouldn't read -- can you read Copperweld as follows?                 Copperweld is ratifying a decision by an entrepreneur or several to organize his entrepreneurial entity as one where there are obvious efficiencies in doing that, such as it would obviously be inefficient to have the sales people behind counters in a single department store competing with each other in price. A joint venture is a situation where it's debatable whether or not there is that kind of efficiency in organization, and, therefore, we apply a rule of reason.     That's Panagra.          I don't see anything in Copperweld that s intended to overrule Panagra. And as long as Panagra is not overruled, we would apply, at least to major decisions by joint ventures, a rule of reason. Now, what is wrong with -- and you might still win on the rule of reason.             But why isn't that analysis correct?     I m putting it forward as a hypothesis for you to discuss.           There is very definitely a joint venture here to play football, but there isn't a joint venture to build houses, and there isn't a joint venture obviously in sight to promote. So they re saying that there s such a different activity, the playing of football versus the promotion of a logo, that we ought to go and look under a rule of reason as to whether a joint venture in promoting a logo is justified in terms of competition's harms and economic benefits.           Well, it would be if they tried to do it, but, there, they would be attacked on the ground that under the rule of reason, they do not have the justification such that the antitrust law would allow them to do it.           And they are saying promoting is precisely the same.             That's why it seems to me to be something that you can't decide in theory. It's a matter of going back to economic facts with witnesses and so forth.           So let's call it  NFL supermarket.      Red Sox supermarket, Patriots automobile shop, Patriots tractor store -- everything becomes Patriots.       Everything -- no competition anywhere.    Now, you say that's ridiculous, and once you say that's ridiculous, you are now into the business of deciding whether this aspect of the undeniable legal joint venture to play baseball or football -- whether this aspect is properly the subject of merger. And once you re into that, you re into your $7 million, and I can't really think of anything that's going to help you there.           And the SG in its brief, you see, on that key 16 and 17, it seemed to me, simply reproduces in precisely somewhat different language, but precisely the argument you are now having:   Is this the kind of thing that should be merged?   We know by applying the rule of reason. And, second, if it is merged, is this particular aspect of it something where there could be competition, and there isn't much justification? That's their rule, too.          Again, we are back to the rule of reason.    So, how do I save you the $7 million?           So we don't even ask the question whether under the rule of reason such a thing is reasonable or justified?
08-67 +++$+++               And why not?     Because the answer to my question was exactly what Justice Stevens said.    Why is it that -- that if you could have the inconsistent verdicts in Powell, well, then, why can't, since they hung, couldn't you try him again on the hung count?    And the answer is, because you're trying him again. And that's why we have all the briefs that we have, because the only way to answer this is to look and see if the policies that underlie the collateral estoppel part of double jeopardy apply here.                  And I can't think of one that doesn't.                 I can't think of one single one that wouldn't apply. Maybe there are some.                 And I can't think of any reason for allowing the government to have a second bite at this apple.       What is the reason?               Of course they don't.        Of course they don't.      Suppose that they never brought up that hung count.     Then you wouldn't even have the first bite at the apple.      So you would think it would be a fortiori you could go ahead.              But that's the case; you clearly can't go ahead.              I didn't think it had anything to do with integrity of anything.                   I thought what it had to do with is that they are being tried at the same time.     And to test that out in my mind, I imagine this.    In February we try the individual for the drug count, he's acquitted.              In June we bring a telephone count.     Absolutely forbidden, right?              Okay.       So why should the government be one whit better off because, in addition to doing that, they happened to bring a telephone count in January along with the other?              Start the other side, which I think Justice Stevens was suggesting.                     Assume that there was only one trial on the substantive count in January.     Now each -- he's acquitted.                  Now you decide to indict him in July on the telephone count.                     You argue to the judge:     Judge, there shouldn't be double jeopardy here because maybe the jury just acquitted him the first time because they were lenient.                Maybe they liked his looks.     Maybe they were distracted by a fly.                  Maybe they were, maybe they were -- and we didn't even get an appeal.     Are you going to win that case?              No, not even a close. Okay.     Not even close. Now, since you're going to lose that case, I grant you there's thousands of case talking about your ability to bring more cases if you have a hung jury.                   I concede all those.      None of them talks about double jeopardy, to my knowledge. So we're back to the hypothetical.               You've lost your case.     Now, all that you did to turn that case into a winning case was you also indicted him on the telephone count in January.              Now, that was my question the first time, and you began to have two answers.                 I just didn't see why the government should be any better off because they also indicted him in January.               Given the language "double jeopardy," you might think the government, if anything, should be worse off, but let's keep them neutral. So what is the reason that the government should be worse off because they indicted him in January on the telephone count as well as in June?                No, no -- better.   I misspoke.
08-674 +++$+++             Why?            Why are you powerless?            Why don't you to go to the Commission and say:      Commission, there is always special circumstances. You may think that in this kind of situation, which is a special situation, that the public interest standard, whether it's in a contract or whether it's in a tariff or wherever you want to put it, is the right standard for review.          You may think that.   But you don't think it for yourselves, you don't think it for somebody else, and here's some reasons why you don't think it for us. And if they agree with your reasons, they'll say:   Fine, go ahead.      And if they don't, they don't. Why aren't you exactly as powerful or powerless as anybody else?           My point is if you don't like that as applied to your situation, you have a remedy.   That's what the public -- that's why they're there, agencies.     They are there to listen to you and give you a remedy, and the remedy is, if you convince them you shouldn't be subject to that, they'll say fine; and otherwise not.     Why are you coming to us who know nothing about natural gas and asking us to do it?           It's electricity.            Then you're going to say you mean they never can do it, but it's well settled. It's well settled that they sometimes can say -- I mean, my point is this:     I just found the quote I was looking for.   So I was thinking natural gas.              It applies to electricity capacity, too.          Justice Jackson:       "The wealth of Midas and the wit of man cannot produce or reproduce a natural gas field." That applies to electricity capacity.                 We can't reproduce it.     You can't.          The Commission devises a system for trying to get it done, and if they do it reasonably, they win.            The standard -- the statute is "just and reasonable."         That calls up a whole mechanism from the 1930s.         I thought that it is long -- we're long past that point, that -- that whatever Brandeis thought it was, which they did in the thirties and forties, that it has also been interpreted to include the power to the Commission to deviate from that, because they find, for example, contract rates under certain circumstances to be just and reasonable, even though you don't use cost-of-service ratemaking.          So is the answer then maybe where Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia were going, that -- because where I m coming from, why I have been asking this, is I actually think the answer to the question so far on the question presented is "sometimes."     Sometimes you can't; sometimes you can. And it depends on a lot of things -- situations, circumstances, arguments to commissions, what they held, et cetera. So maybe that's the thing to do, you answer the question, say "sometimes."            Sometimes they can use one; sometimes it's the other.            Indeed, in this very case, they've argued that it's -- that it's not even within the mainstream of Mobile-Sierra.                 And maybe that's so, maybe it's not.          Send it back, say it depends on circumstances, time, et cetera.                 And then they can argue all these things out that we've just been hearing. What about that?             So are you aware of any law or any statement by any judge, ever, that exempts the -- the FERC from the basic requirement that its rules, regulations, and everything else not be arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion?              And so, as long as that's so, I guess you could mount a challenge on the ground that to apply the contract regime system to circumstance X, Y, and Z, without permitting your challenge that you want, is, in fact, a violation of the APA, at the least. Okay? Now, that's why I say "sometimes."              Could you imagine such a situation, which I think is what Justice Sotomayor was getting at, or do you want it all the time?   If you want it all the time, I'm not -- you're not getting sympathy from me.              If want to say there could be such a time, maybe.              I think I could think of five.   All right? So -- so where are we?
08-678 +++$+++ 
08-680 +++$+++              Just in case -- just in case we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it, which I know you don't want us to do.                 I'm now thinking and I would like your comment, if you want, of a combination of what Justice Alito said and what I said, that is, that there are two parts to the Edwards thing. One is the lawyer part, and the other is the incriminating self part. Now the lawyer part would be handled by shaping a rule based on the rules of evidence, along the lines I suggested.    And that would give you a time.              And then the Miranda part could be handled by saying:                but the suspect retains the right to show that this questioning is badgering without the question marks.                In other words what they are really up to is to try to get him to change his mind.       Now would that work?             Well, if you're -- if you are going to use the Edwards, which I think is a good idea, as counsel part, which I think is a good starting place, you and every other member of the bar deals with this problem every day of the week.                    Not every day of the week, but very often.         You know somebody's represented in a case, and you know you are supposed to talk to the lawyer.      But eventually time passes, and then you are probably free to talk to him, because the whole thing's gone away. Now that's a pretty vague rule.                   You could make it more specific, but the -- the bar has lived with that kind of situation, I guess for years.             So why can't we here?             No, no, that's not what I mean.   I mean that the obligation to deal with counsel, you don't have, after enough time passes, that it's no longer reasonable to think that that individual either has or wants counsel.
08-681 +++$+++                  On that particular point, just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you have had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I. All right. So, it seems to me, looking at these three sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain matter are not subject to judicial review, and it includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I am entitled to be a refugee or asylum. Now, we look at that, it says in there it's subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and you read it completely correctly, but you left out these words "except as provided in subsection (e)." So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1).      Now, those are the people who knock at the door and they want asylum. And there is some procedures for them. So, now we look at (e) to see what are the procedures for them.      And lo and behold, right there in (2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says there are some you can have habeas corpus. So I imagine a person who has been ordered removed under (e). All right.                Now it says you can have a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien is right, I am going to issue an injunction. Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the very next section (f), what we have are two provisions, (f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass action against the whole thing, you can't enter an injunction. And then we look at (2), and it says if his is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e), (f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying "I need asylum," unless they meet clear and present danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and present -- yeah. Okay.    Now, I will admit I read that quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something. And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if you think I might be right?              What it says here specifically is it says habeas proceedings.              Well, let me add one other thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work for this section (f)(2) to do.                And I think I found some.     And I think what you say is wait a minute, we agree it's like habeas.          But and I think it would be like an exclusion order rather than a removal order. And I did notice previously when it talks about 1225, sometimes it uses the word "exclusion" and sometimes it says "removal." But if you were that district habeas judge and you get a thing saying removal, you don't really vacate it.                      I think what you had do is order an injunction against its enforcement. Here I don't know --               What are we supposed to do? What would you had do?         Suppose you are a district court judge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition comes in and it's from someone who says, "I'm going to be on the 5:00 airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real case here.     I think I am right."              And he has eight pages attached and you read through that.                       And you say, "He has a point.     Now how good this point is, I don't know. So I would like to put this -- I would like to have everybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it out." Now, that probably happens.                      Now what is worrying me about your position on this -- which, although most -- I think every circuit is against you on this, except for this one.              And it seems to me that would make it impossible for the district judge to do, because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's clear and convincing that this man is going to win.                    All he knows is he has a point and he would like to hear more about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane three hours from now from Hong Kong.                    So I -- so how is it supposed to work?              Right.             Well, what court would ever do anything else?    I mean, why if you were granting a stay, would you not want to do that so you can fully consider the issues?
08-6925 +++$+++                 All right.       Suppose we interpret the statute, the act of the statute as requiring more force than that, as requiring something more than spitting.      Now, suppose that sometimes, as they have made a strong case, that touching is a separate thing under this statute because that's what the Florida Supreme Court said, and moreover, there are prosecutions that seem not to fit within striking.                    How do we know whether by and large this were a touching as used in Florida, covers things with mostly minimal touching, minimal force or enough force to get within the statute?             It might have, but battery by touching does seem a separate category.                    And at that point, you have to decide, is there an element there of force?   And I think it requires more force than just the simplest touching. Now, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact that there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient to take it outside the statute.              That's not my approach. I would say, in the mind run of cases, does there have to be more force than just spitting?                    And now I don't know how it's prosecuted.         So why don't I say in this case, from my perspective, very well, I don't know.                       No one knows.   No one has told me.             No one has looked into it.   It's very hard to look into, but not impossible. It's the Government's job, faced with a 15-year statute, to do the looking.                    They have the resources.   More than a defense attorney.                   Therefore, uncertain as I am, I must decide this in favor of the defendant.   What's the response to that?             Hear what they said, what the Eleventh Circuit said, it said that if battery under Florida law fits within the description of (1), then it is a violent crime for ACCA purposes.                     And then it says if not, then not.     And as long as the issue was in front of them I would think that those last four words are a holding.            Why?            Was it argued?            It is pretty hard to see it given Begay, how this is like arson or, you know, the other three there, burglary, arson --            -- explosives.            So, I mean, I don't know. Maybe the court of appeals felt -- what they said was, "if not, then not."      And it was raised in argument.            Yeah, but I -- I thought -- you know, it's -- it's like the other four listed out.            But then we are rereading these three other examples out because then "other" covers any crime that poses a risk of violence, or whatever the words are there -- I forget the words. Poses a risk.            And you think drunk driving doesn't present a serious potential risk of physical injury?
08-724 +++$+++              What would you have done? I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this.                    But I mean, I have heard the other side and I have read the argument.     And it makes sense logically to say he has the worst defendant he has ever seen.                    He's murdered lots of people in cold blood.              He gets up on the stand and says:     I'm going to kill a lot more.                 He sounds totally bonkers.     And -- and he says to the jury, I can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it was terrible.     I can't tell you that there's anything here that should make you feel better about him; there is nothing.     But we are a nation of people who are humane and our law says don't put a person to death when he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a lower standard of insanity than I had to meet.                    But it's clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their testimony, and that's what they said.                    So be humane. Now, you think he should have said something else.   What?              No, he -- he said why.        He said.   He said:   We don't execute people who are crazy and this guy is crazy.        He might not be crazy enough to meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity. He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you that he's seriously crazy.           And if you don't -- if you doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes. I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.              Or we had at least one State court that found it okay.               But I agree with all that you are saying.     What I am saying my hard time is here is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no sympathy?              Well, he talked about nothing else.     And I understand -- look, I am not an expert.     I haven't argued these things to juries, and I recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very rambling.    I didn't think it was rambling. I thought he was trying to spend a lot of time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them enough. And so you describe that for a couple of pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, is because he recognizes this is the most sensational case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are going to congratulate you. But what you are doing here is you are applying a standard, and you are proud to be an American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane standard that requires you to not give the death penalty when the man's insane. Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over. And how can I -- since there is a lower court that seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say it wasn't?            Didn't -- didn't they cite Strickland?            Well, I guess then they concede the argument.            Why do we have no idea then?   If they cited Strickland, why do we have no idea what they --             How -- how does that work? Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he would even number them. And it's fairly common to find a court of appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17, and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.             Now, that -- that happens all the time.             And, now, it's very, very common that, in making that argument, there could be some good grounds for rejecting it, and there could be some bad grounds for rejecting it. So would we send -- do we send every case like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected it for a good reason or a bad reason?              What we do is we assume they did it for a bad reason?             Is there any authority for that?   Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one, but I -- I do think hearing it that suddenly habeas opinions and district court opinions would grow by an order of magnitude, because it's very common to see arguments rejected summarily.             Now, is there any authority for the proposition that if they reject it summarily, that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we assume they are wrong?              Well, why wouldn't you do that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion? Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied, motion denied, this denied, denied, denied.                   And if I'm going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most common thing in the world?              We did?          I mean, I've reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all his reasons.   And the question is really, given the circumstance, can we say that he acted contrary to law?             If it's trial-based, you look at what the facts are that he might have taken.               So you are saying -- I mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the habeas judge vis--vis the State judge there is the same as the Federal appellate judge vis--vis the district judge?    That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes a finding, doesn't fully explain it.                      Now, I would think it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application of a Supreme Court case.           And I know how to review that. I mean, I -- I know how to review it, I think. Okay.     So you are saying however I do that, I should do the same thing and the -- but you don't - you don't think there is a more relaxed standard than that?    You think that's basically the standard?               Same -- but if they had made an explicit finding, then maybe it would be a tougher standard.             All right.
08-728 +++$+++              How -- how do you think it should work?     It seems to me they are two separate things.     On September 7th, the defendant comes in and says, "Judge, you've told me I have to have everything ready by the 13th.     I would like additional time to prepare."     And what he said was, "until September 25th." He said that on the 13th:           "I want until September 25th."     This is what I think the Chief Justice is asking, in part. Now, what the judge did is excluded everything from September 7th all the way to October 4th.    And if I understand your argument -- I'm not sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th, that really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless, maybe there's something there. What about the period from the 25th to the 4th?    I don't know what the theory could be on excluding that one, because what the defendant said on the 7th -- on September 13th, he said, "Judge, I don't want any more time.   I don't even want to file any motions."             Yes.       On the 25th, he said that.   So what is the basis of excluding the 25th to the 4th?               So it's --               That's what I understand. You get the period from the -- the 25th to the 4th comes under (D) or (H).     It's a motion that is filed, and it's under advisement.               So it comes under (D) or (H).   Is that right?               I mean, I don't mean little (h)(1).   I mean big (H).         It's attributed to a period during which any proceedings actually under any advisement -- or maybe it comes under (D) -- a motion not to file a motion is a motion.
08-7412 +++$+++  
08-7621 +++$+++            You say it's suspect.         What is your opinion, so far as you can do it, following category:     Non-homicide, life without parole, under the age of 18 when committed?           Not in your own system?           You don't know how many people in Florida --           Non-homicide, life without parole, under the age of 18 when committed.          And they say 77?          What?        Sorry.          Okay.        Let's -- let's count it their way.   Let's say that a -- non-homicide --          So -- so in your example, Mr. Smith was sentenced to life without parole for a robbery.    Then you said Mr. Smith also killed someone. Now, was he convicted of killing someone?          Yes.    Okay.     And so did the judge have in front of him the conviction for the killing of the person as well as for the burglary or whatever?          Yes.    Okay.     So I think I could count that as a homicide offense.               I understand your point. Now, let's suppose that we take those out of it; in other words, for argument's purpose, concede that where there is also a homicide offense, it counts as homicide, not in the set I am asking you about. I m asking you about the set of those non-homicide offenses, life without parole, and they were under the age of 18 when committed.               How many in Florida?          Even though you gave -- said that the reason for the difference was a set of instances that I just asked you to put to the side.          So, what is the right -- go ahead.          I mean, I think if you want to address it, that the basic argument here is we want a bright line.     And the justification for the bright line is (a) it's pretty unusual to have this.                   So that is one part of the clause.        And in respect to it being cruel, you go back to what is supposed to be some kind of rough, basic connection between criminal law and generally accepted principles of morality. And the confusion and uncertainty about the moral responsibility of a 13-year-old is such that it is not -- it is a cruel thing to do to remove from that individual his entire life.             You say we re at the extreme.                     Now that's roughly what s perking around in my mind, and I would like you to reply to that.          That wasn't my point.     I guess I wasn't clear.      My point was, of course, there can be cases in any set which go in all kinds of different directions.      But, as a general matter, human beings are uncertain about how much moral responsibility to assign to individuals in a particular category, and that category roughly corresponds with an age of maturity. So you get into arguments when you get to 10, no; 11, no; 17, yes maybe; 16, yes maybe.            But as long as we are around 3 years old, 5, 7, 9, 12, and they want to say certainly 14, we are in that area of ambiguity.       And not just we, people all over America, some thinking one way, some thinking another.    And that's enough to cut the connection with morality, a strong enough connection that could justify taking the person's entire life away. You see, I'm trying to make a general argument, and maybe I haven't stated it perfectly.             But if you can get the drift of what I'm talking about, I would like to hear your reply.          Do you want to comment on the district court, the -- the -- what -- what the -- your opponent says is that this Florida rule is a rule as the district court applied it that said the following:     You have to file a challenge within 2 years.     There are three exceptions to that.                 One and three clearly don't apply.             And as to two, Roper isn't clear enough to make it apply. Their response to that is there is no Florida law that says you have to challenge a sentence within 2 years.        That Florida courts -- and then they have, like, 14 cases listed here.                And the Supreme Court of Florida has said that when you are trying to correct an illegal sentence, that whole part of the statute does not apply.     Okay?     What's the response to that?             Okay.        So what I should do is go look up and see what those cases hold, and -- and you said to the lower court or the court of appeals -- you said their argument is wrong.                The 2-year statute does apply.     The 2-year statute does apply.                 There are three exceptions, and you do not fit within section (B) because.     Where did you say that?             So the State didn't even deny what he was saying?          So the State -- he says that whole section doesn't apply.            There is no 2-year statute.    And you say Florida did not reply in a brief to that argument?          All right.          In any case, there is a circularity point here, I guess.            If we were to say in our opinion -- if we were to say that Roper does hold that there is a fundamental constitutional right which we extend to this case and it applies here, and it applies to the -- retroactively to those whose -- certainly those who are raising the issue, then we would send it back and Florida now would not bar it under this statute, because it would fall squarely within the exception.   Is that right?
08-769 +++$+++               But the point -- the point I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are thinking is that, just as real obscenity when depicted does nothing communicative but rather appeals to the instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of things that do not communicate, but appeal to the instinct of sadism; and that is true when other creatures are killed for the pleasure of the people who want to see them killed. Now, that's what you are saying.            Now -- and I think maybe that's true.          We don't have to decide that, perhaps.   But the government says that is this statute, that is this statute read in light of its basic intent, and it is up to the Court to interpret it so as it achieves that objective.            And you say that's not possible.   Why not?             I think what -- I think what's going on is -- is not -- your conflating two things.   One is you are trying to produce education about something that has no communicative value. In so far as you are trying to make an argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the government, here, is saying I think the statute is intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's hard to draw a line. Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's worst instinct, that is not to advocate it or not to advocate it. It is to try to make money out of it, and that's what they think, I believe, the statute is aimed at.             So that's why they have the journalistic exception.             We are going to advertise a drug that is known to kill people.             We are advertising --
08-810 +++$+++         Why -- why -- as I understand it -- which big if -- you and I are both working at Xerox, and in year 1 -- and we each have 500,000 in our contribution account, and you leave, and you take the 500,000.        I stay, and I don't.             Okay? Now, my 500,000 over the next 10 years is going to grow somewhat -- as long as it wasn't 2007. But it -- (Laughter.)        Okay.      I might spend it, but if I leave it there, it would grow, okay.                But some -- some people leave it there, they grow.        So, when figuring the floor, what Xerox does is look to see how much it grew.   They look at the whole thing, now, 10 years later, and they say, you re up above the floor, good-bye, we will give you this, not the floor, okay. Now, you are in the same position, and you happen to come back to Xerox, and all they want to do is say, you know, we d like to assume yours grew, too, I mean, not -- a little, anyway, and the first thing they wanted to do is to say it should have grown the same way we treat our own guys, as it having grown. And the court of appeals says that's wrong because you left the words out, but send it back to see it's fair.   So then the expert comes in, and the expert says, well, they didn't want to give us that way to grow it; here is how -- we will assume it grew like an insurance company, the most incredibly conservative people in the world, how -- how they would have treated it as growing, if you bought an annuity right then, and that just gives us even a lower number. And -- and they want to say, why didn't you at least listen to that, instead of coming to the fact which is very, very unusual, it didn't grow at all, in which case, you are eligible for the floor.          So I think that's why they think it's either an abuse of discretion or you should have listened more to the -- to the expert -- should have done something else.          It's a pretty big windfall for people.    You re working at Xerox, and your plan is about approaching the minimum level -- let's quit and then go invest it, and then come back 3 days before you re bound to retire, and then you re going get whatever the plan grew, and you ll also get your minimum.        Well, why would anyone promise them that kind of a deal?        What about -- a bit more serious question -- I mean, that is a serious question, but the more general question, what about something that is analogous to Skidmore deference?        You say -- you take the -- the district judge here can take -- takes the administrator's opinion for what it's worth.        He has to listen to it.        That is essentially the principle, I thought.        But he does have to read it.   He has to read it --        Read it, and take it for what it's worth.        You don't think they would -- you think they would do that?        Yes.     Okay.
08-861 +++$+++           Well, what do -- what do you say in response to their formal argument that heads of departments are those people whom the President has at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and Freytag is support for that.              And these aren't those people, so the SEC s members must be inferior officers, and the Constitution says nothing about and implicitly forbids inferior officers from appointing other inferior officers beneath them. All right, that's a formal argument, but I got that out of their briefs, and I want to know what you respond to it.            Yes.     So I -- so we have to take the dissent there as opposed to taking the majority?            I see.          What s the reason --          What is the reason for this?   Having read this enlightening opinion of Justice Scalia in Freytag, which is enlightening to me if I've read it correctly,     I would say that the question -- there are two separate questions. One question is:           What is a department?   And this might well fit within that. And the second question, which is separate but mixed up in the cases, but not his, is:              When is it constitutional for Congress to limit the President in his ability to dismiss a -- an officer of the United States or -- inferior or superior -- for cause? And -- and what's -- if you can answer it, what are the justifications here for imposing that requirement?          I'm not interested in that.   I'm interested in -- I'm developing --          That's right.
08-876 +++$+++              Before you -- do you -- does the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate opportunity to brief the constitutionality of the statute?             Might this come up in the Skilling case?             So we have to say, in your view -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I don't -- you answered it once you said that. The -- the -- what I wonder is, does the government feel, in order to have a full opportunity to brief constitutionality, that we should issue an order saying:    Please brief the constitutionality?              So we should say that?             Why?       So the boss will leave the room so that the worker can continue to read the racing form.     Deception?           Designed to work at reading the racing form instead of doing your honest work and, therefore, violation? Now, explain to me how your test does not -- and I think you can probably do it; I just don't understand it at the moment.           Explain it to me, how your test does not make this statute potentially criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, or some tens of millions?              Now this -- I'm just getting a label, and as I hear you talk, I think it's not what you necessarily -- I found in the brief, or didn't understand it from the brief -- but I found precisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have labeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?             Yes, yes.        You've read the briefs-- you've read the briefs.               He has alternative A and alternative B.    And alternative A he says kickbacks, and it could be limited to bribery or kickbacks.                 In alternative B he adds bribery, kickbacks and undisclosed self-dealing capable of causing economic harm.                 That's what I got out of the brief.             Now I just heard what you said and it sounded like the same thing.             It is not causing economic harm.             So what about my racing form?   He is acting for himself and not his employer.             Now you see the problem? It may be you would never prosecute it.                   It may be a jury would never convict.           But that isn't the basis for having a statute that picks up 80 or 100 million people.              That -- that is Altshuler B, which I -- that seems to work, but then you want to go beyond that.              And I think in going beyond that is the paradigm case of -- of moonlighting?              No, because --              No, no, no, no.    I'm trying to get -- encapsulate your test in my mind.             I'm just trying to find a way, so as I listen to you, I think what you are driving at -- a paradigm case of what you are driving at would be moonlighting.             Yes -- no -- yes.      He takes a day -- he leaves an hour early because he is selling real estate.             You have to have all those elements?    One -- I mean, everybody is working for the company.    Everybody has loyalty to the company owner. And, now, you are saying everybody has competing things that they sort of like to do, which would deprive the owner of the honest services, but you are saying, in addition to that, he has to have his own company?             In addition to that, what?               I thought materiality just has to do with whether a false statement you make, in fact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the harmful effect.               That's always there.               No, and the -- and the reason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I mean now.   In the cases you just mention, the bribe case?   Right, the legislature is not going to gain.               The legislator or the briber might, but somebody will. And the object of those bribes was that there would be economic gain, and that was what -- when I went through all those MCNally cases, I thought I could fit them into this alternative Altshuler thing, but now, you -- you worry me that you have a different test that will bring in like any failure to fill out a disclosure form. A deliberate failure to answer a box, one out of 1,000, for every government employee, would immediately -- 20 years in jail.
08-88 +++$+++                What about Donaldson and Moore, those two periods?          Those two periods, the Donaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I can tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods when the State -- when the court below was saying that all that happened here was that the lawyers who were appointed, did a very bad job. You can't say they weren't appointed.                   It isn't that he didn't have counsel.                 He had counsel, and they just didn't do very much. Now, why should that be accounted against the stayer?     Is Moore special?             Was there really a problem of prosecutorial behavior?                   Is Donaldson the same as Sleigh?     I don't know.              Is Donaldson a case where they -- is equivalent to having no lawyer?                   I don't know how to deal with it.
08-905 +++$+++           So, is there a difference -- I'm trying to get these terminological differences clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the difference between you and the government. If you go back to my -- my Burma example, I think both you and the government agree that the statute doesn't begin to run until you find this person in Burma.   But now, I'm not sure you disagree about -- whether you agree or disagree about this.                So I think -- you find the person in Burma.            That s 6 months after you had all the other indications.                Now, both of you say the statute begins to run.         You would say, when you find that person in Burma, you have to get, through him, enough information to be able to file your complaint now in respect to scienter. But the government would say, when you get that person in Burma, he has to be able to give you enough storm clouds, in respect to -- to scienter. Is that what the -- is there that difference?   I think --        Is there no difference, then, between the two of you, or what?        Okay.     So do you think -- you think the standard should be -- and I can find out from the government, and I will, I guess -- that it should be -- that you have to -- a reasonable person having talked to the guy in Burma would walk away thinking, Fraud. That's the standard; you think they re both there -- but both of you agree you have to find the guy in Burma, though it could turn out that other features of the case, 6 months earlier, would put a reasonable person on notice to begin looking for somebody in Burma?           So you both agree about that?           So -- so you want to say, you ought to get enough information from that or in all the other things the same, so that you have -- are able to file the complaint.     They want to say you have to get enough so a reasonable person would believe a fraud had occurred.   Is that right?           No, I'm not saying -- I'm not so worried about that.        I know there's a lot less, but -- or more, whatever -- but I am --          So how -- how -- what's the right phrasing?    Because I -- I understood that inquiry notice has somehow made an appearance, and it seems to confuse me.    So you say the statute begins to run when a reasonable person would have found facts sufficient to show a violation or sufficient to permit him to file a complaint that alleges a violation?               How -- does that come in any way?          How do I say that here?          Okay.          So you are basically in agreement.   And then the way that the -- the -- then the way that this inquiry thing comes in is that sometimes, perhaps quite often, a reasonable person, given certain facts, would begin to inquire.          And if it happened to be a case where inquiry played no role, then it wouldn't. It's all a question of what a reasonable person would do.
08-911 +++$+++            Do you want to say anything about, apparently, this idiosyncratic thought that I have had?   This is -- it s -- my thought is that both sides are arguing:    We just look to see if it's discretion given by statute or given by regulation, and we draw the line on reviewability there. Now, what we're talking about is a big set of cases, including frauds and various things where there is some discretion substantively to let the person stay.   Now, on that big set of cases, the statute says if it's fraud, et cetera, we don't want review.                 But if it's asylum, we want review.             Isn't that how it works, basically -- basically?           Okay.        Fine.   I'm saying instead of looking to see whether it's a rehearing or procedural or reopening matter, period, you look to see whether it has to do with the basic category. If it's something that Congress doesn't want courts to meddle in, that carries over to reopening, which is the same thing; it carries over to rehearing petitions -- they re all about the same thing.                 And if it's something that Congress did want courts to meddle in, like asylum, it carries over to reopening, and it carries over to rehearing petitions and other such matters. So Congress has one simple judgment:          We want courts to meddle in these affairs substantively or we don't.     And our job would be to say, right, if that's what you want, unless it s unconstitutional, that's what we give you. Do you see the way -- I'm just drawing the line vertically instead of horizontally.             But I agree, nobody has.     Now, to me that makes sense, but apparently to no one else.     So I would like to be talked out. (Laughter.)          I didn't leave anyone out. No one is universal. (Laughter.)          How do we know they didn't? I mean, there s such a thing in the law called -- what we think of often -- they often use the word "ancillary" to describe it.     And when Congress passes a thing that has to do with X, you often interpret a statute to carry with it the application to ancillary matters, the thing that are bound up in X, even though they don't have a separate sentence because you can't think of everything that describes every matter ancillary to X.              That's normal in law.          Yes, and we would say those decisions specified includes those decisions that are totally wrapped up in the same thing.             So that if a person tries to escape this by simply making his main argument in a rehearing petition, he can't escape it, because it's really the same thing.          Well, why not?       This is not a matter that is the subject of the special provision. A reopening petition is the same kind of thing, identical to the initial petition, and so something that applies to the initial petition applies to the reopening petition because they are the same kind of animal.                If you have a -- you know -- I mean, okay.              Oh, forget it. I see the point, no point going further.          Do you have any reason why Congress would have taken great trouble to make certain that courts can review asylum decisions, but Congress would not have wanted a court to review a reopening of an asylum matter, which can be done, after all, only if something new comes up that justifies asylum? For example, a new government comes and takes over a country, and now they are going to murder the person, and that couldn't be considered the first time because the old government was there, and they were just going to torture him, all right?        So -- so there's something new here. Now, why would any human being say, we want to get courts involved in the first decision, but we want to keep them out of the second decision?           Reopening is not a bite at the apple.   Reopening is a new thing; at least, by and large, and supposed to be -- a change.          Exactly, and that's why I ended up with this unusual -- (Laughter.)
08-9156 +++$+++                Well, what's an example?               I can't think of any -- give me an example --               -- where you're trying to proceed under (d)(2), and (e)(1) is somehow relevant. Couldn't think of one.             Uh-huh.             Uh-huh.             No.      You just look at them, and you look under (d)(2), and you say this is an unreasonable determination of fact, period.              There's no reason to go into (e)(1).        I mean, if it is an unreasonable determination of fact, he wins.             And if it isn't, you win.             It didn't say that.      What it says in (e)(1) is (e)(1) is talking about in a proceeding instituted by an application by a person in custody, the factual issue is presumed correct.              But if you fail to develop -- - you know, in a proceeding, it's presumed correct. You're right it doesn't say it literally. But I can't figure out an application for it unless they're talking about where there is a new hearing. Otherwise there is just no need for it, it is just repetitive and it gets people mixed up, and (d)(2) does all the work.            I see that, I see that.            That's a possible way to look at it.            And the problem I see with that -- now I see why it's controverted, but the problem with these standards of review, it just -- it mixes people up, and it sounds as if you're bringing in a hammer after you've brought in a saw, and the hammer looks a little tougher than the saw, and -- but why get into all this business?             Well, we have one here, and my real objection, I guess -- and it's interesting, I now see the conflict, with Justice Alito's clear explanation of it.    And I -- I suppose the -- the thing I would ask you then is, look, my objection to it, hypothetically, is it's too complicated.                  Lawyers have enough trouble trying to figure this out.             Is there any reason we need to interpret it that way?         The language doesn't have to be.   Why not have just a simple, clear thing?                If -- if they're unreasonable, the State loses, and if they're not unreasonable, the State wins.                Da-da.   That's too simple.   But why not use it?              If that's so, why would we not soon have what I call the habeas corpus jurisprudence of what is a subsidiary and what is a major fact and what is a finding? And what's wonderful about that is no habeas corpus proceeding will ever end because, throughout the country, people will make mistakes about what is the -- what is the subsidiary and the subsidiary to the subsidiary, and then what is the more general, and pretty soon, we'll have all -- everybody will be arguing about that, and there will only be four professors in the country who understand which is which, and they will each say different things.
08-964 +++$+++           Suppose you say this.           I'm just testing things out.        Start with Diehr.           I mean -- and Diehr has these words in it, similar words; it just says  e.g.  -- are you following me?          Okay.        Now, you say what is it they have done in this case in the Federal Circuit? They have pulled back.        That's a mood.           That's a mood. They ve pulled back insofar as they are pulling back from business methods, not machines, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.   Okay?   You say we see no problem with that. Now, they have left much unresolved.              One, transformation; how broad or narrow is that?                We don't know.    Many people's problems will be solved if it's either broad on the one hand or narrow in the other. Two, are you automatically patented -- in the patent statute, if you just sort of reduce this to a machine by adding a computer on at the end?                They've flagged that as a problem.         They haven't answered it. Could there ever be a situation where it doesn't meet this test but still is patentable?                We re not sure.           Yes.           Do you see what I'm trying to do?   I'm trying to note the things that have been raised in these 80 briefs insofar as possible, say there s a lot there for the future that we can't really decide, but say as a pull back, okay.           So I thought you were saying that the correct argument for the people attacking the patent in that case was to say, this is not a machine.   The machine there is a computer.             This is a program that changes switches, and that is a different process for the use of the machine. Now, whether that process is or is not patentable depends upon a lot of things that we don't have to go into in this case.             Is that right?          Okay.        Well, then what is right?          But then all we do is every example that I just gave, that I thought were examples that certainly wouldn t be patented, you simply patent them.   All you do is just have a set of instructions for saying how to set a computer to do it.            Anyone can do that.   Now, it's a machine. So all the business patents are all right back in.   Now, that -- what I think we were looking for was -- or at least I was -- was why that isn't so, and how you are going to later, down the road, deal with this situation of all you do is you get somebody who knows computers, and you turn every business patent into a setting of switches on a machine because there are no businesses that don't use those machines.
08-969 +++$+++                Before you get to Anza, this might be a good time to ask because I don't think we focused on this in Pasquantino.                 But if in fact the failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then why isn't every corporation that files an income tax return and makes two false statements automatically liable for RICO?   I mean --               Well, that would mean the States have a new method, which I don't think they use, a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who makes two false statements or a false statement in two income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would have vast repercussions.          I mean, it might be very beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis; but --               How, how -- why would it not be --               But they left -- they don't have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes. But in effect you would read into the RICO predicate protecting States.               That may be, but nobody focused on this issue.         So -- so that's what's bothering me.   What is the -- what is the stopping place?               Or is there one?          And if there is none, how do we reconcile this view of -- they're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and Pasquantino to the contrary.              Right.         But they're suggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come up.              Or focused on.    It's come up but not focused on.              So in your view California --              -- which has a $10 billion deficit, could go through, find every instance where a corporation made two false statements in two tax returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're owed.              It doesn't say systematic understatement.              It says two --              -- predicate acts.              And the predicate acts are a deliberate false statement.              If they did, then why didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as a predicate act?              Oh, well, that cuts against you.              Because if they put in one, your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need that or not.   Your theory applies to every tax, every tax.              No, but go back to my question.              My question is, forget the cigarette taxes.   If I accept your argument, am I then saying that California, New York, and every other State that's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go through, look for two tax returns that have a false statement in them that were mailed in, and thereby collect RICO damages?            Well, that's a pretty far-reaching --            Do you know anybody, any court that has ever said that?            Why would --            If Congress wanted that result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?            All right.        So I think that their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right, it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud.                  All these tax violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax return normally.             So all of these would be mail fraud.    But mail fraud is not a treble damages statute.    And therefore the question is who will prosecute, State or Federal?              So normally it's State if it's a State tax.     But it's one thing to say Congress didn't care about that and quite another thing to say that Congress didn't care if the States were going to use this in order to collect three times what the taxes are owed.   And so they're looking for a way to cut off this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax -- failure to pay your State taxes.                 And that's why they've hit on this idea of the antitrust.                  I don't know if that's a satisfactory idea.             I don't see the solution. I think I see the problem.             Well, why is it that you haven't argued -- why haven't you --             Why is that relevant as far as cause is concerned?
08-970 +++$+++             What is the overhead?            What is the overhead?        I mean, that's something that I find interesting and important, and I can't find it anywhere.              The numbers began to bother me in the same way they did with Justice Alito.   I m thinking:     There are 30,000 hours.          They got 10.5 million.     That translates into, what is it, $350 an hour.   Now, if the lawyer works for 2,000 hours of the year, which is a little high, he is being compensated at $700,000 on average in this case.                 But he has to pay overhead.     So what's that?           40 percent?     30? 20?            Well, I mean, if you have any rough idea at all, because I think if it's anywhere near $700,000 on average, you say to a taxpayer:                 You are going to pay this, and that's more money than 99 percent of the taxpayers hope to see in their lives, and suddenly they are paying that money to somebody, which is -- I could say:     Okay, pay them 400,000.           That's what he would get as the average fee for the toppest, most top lawyer.    And that's, you know, pretty high. And -- but $700,000 a year for a lawyer.             Wow.     And that's what this judge paid. Now, what is it that came out of that? That's what I want to know before I make up my mind, frankly.   And I'm going to try to look it up, but I'm trying -- I'm trying to get a rough idea here.              Oh, I know, but --          -- that doesn't help me, and the reason it doesn't help me is because if it's a very, very high number in dollars per year, then I am tempted to think:    Well, very high is enough.             You don't need very, very, very high. You see my point?          Yes.     I would be saying Be satisfied forever with very, very high, the most top pay that any top lawyer gets; do not want even more than that. And if in fact I doubt that I have really made a difference to incentives on that one, for the reason that the Solicitor General said -- and my goodness, how do we explain this to the average person? That -- those are the questions that are genuinely going through my mind.     I haven't made up my mind how I will come out in this case.        So it's not a kind of putting this to you.     I don't know.          Should I -- should I look at the fact that, in the early 1970s, when this was done, legal fees were not quite so high?        And perhaps, comparatively so, they weren't quite so high, either.           Not just inflation.    I think the discrepancy between these top legal fees and the fee of the average person -- or the work of the average person, the average wage for a family of four has changed quite a lot.      I suspect that's true, but I could look it up.   But should I look it up?
08-974 +++$+++           How is it absent?    Because the statute says that the established -- the -- it's established -- namely, the unlawful employment practice -- it's established only if, and certainly if, the respondent uses --          -- a particular employment practice that has a disparate impact.              That refers back to (a)(2). So back in that period, on a certain date, he used that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that particular date, he established the unlawful employment practice by using a test that limited, et cetera.           Is my impression -- is there anything else in that (k)?            You see, it lists about 10 things, let's say 10 -- imagine.            One of those things is that it was used.            Now, all the other things there will not have been -- are things that -- that -- to do with the test, basically.            So you have like six or seven that have to do with the test and the criteria, and then you have one that it was used.           And -- and so I thought, looking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for a different purpose but --           But, I mean, this (k) has to do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the critical element of it was that the practice be used.            Well, you'd have to then say that all the things that are there, the other nine and so forth -- all those nine things --            Well --            Yes.            No, well, that's true -- it does --
08-992 +++$+++             So they are going to say, I imagine below -- I'm not sure -- say:                  Look, that's right, and Doctor talked about the shift from mandatory to discretionary, and the district court -- the State, in Doctor, said that it was a mandatory -- it's mandatory. But in this case, the district court said it's discretionary.      So insofar as there are two rules -- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of the most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a difference, it made no difference.             How would you fill in this sentence?    I'm beginning where the Chief Justice did. Say everybody said:      Look, this opinion is at least unclear.    It's -- everybody agrees that the simple existence of discretion does not make a State ground inadequate, so we send it back for you now.                And you will have some good arguments, I guarantee each side will have some good arguments, as to whether they were being consistent or not, whether there was a consistent rule or not.             Now, next sentence, which maybe would never be written:            This is not to say that discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it could be applied inconsistently. Now, there could be another sentence, because that other sentence would have to go on to the fact that any discretionary rule will never be applied with perfect consistency or anywhere near it.                    That would be true if you give a trial judge the choice in his discretion to waive a -- a time limit ruling. Some will do it with one.                     Some will do it in the other.   You can't do it perfectly.                   So is there any sentence we could put in there?                    So you hedged on there, and probably they will, too, because it's very hard to find the right sentence. You don't want the simple application of discretion, you say -- which inevitably means some inconsistency, to make a State rule inadequate.                    On the other hand, they can't go too far.                So what is too far?              But, but, but, but, but, a trial Supreme Court -- a Supreme Court in a State is supervising lots of trial courts, and you will have different human beings sitting there as judges, and they will inevitably be inconsistent with each other to some degree.    Have you not noticed that?            So is there anything we can say that will improve the situation?                    That's why I started out by saying maybe the best thing is to say nothing.
08-998 +++$+++  
09-10245 +++$+++        All right.     You want us to decide this case.     I completely agree with what Justice Alito is saying, Justice Scalia, that maybe the world after Booker is different.     And I have not thought that one through. I am thinking this case is a pre-Booker case.     It is not real.     I am thinking it is on the cusp, so how am I to treat this case?     If it is a case where the guidelines apply, if it is such a case -- and I think maybe everyone here has assumed throughout that it was.     Am I right about that?     Were you saying this is a case where the guidelines do not apply, where they are not binding?     I mean, where pre-Booker doesn't count?       How do you want us to take this, pre-Booker or post-Booker?       I know, you think the -- I think it is completely different regardless.     So let's avoid that controversy at the moment, and you tell me whether you want me to take it pre-Booker or post-Booker.       I want you -       All right.     So you want to -- you want to set aside this post-Booker?       Then perhaps we should have the pre-argument.     If we are taking this pre-Booker, I would have throughout it is QED.       I mean, imagine that the that the Sentencing Commission -- imagine.     It is not true, but imagine that the Sentencing Commission had written the following words:     "Plea bargaining over sentences is above," as many argued they should.     They write those words.     Then they write the next word, "exception."     There is an exception, however; you are permitted to plea bargain about a sentence insofar as you argue about the range, where, within the range, it applies.     And of course when you apply the guidelines, as when you always apply the guidelines, here or elsewhere, departure is an unusual case. Now, suppose those were the words that the Commission had written.     Could -- how -- is it possible under those circumstances you would still be arguing this sentence under the -- plea bargaining abolished except over where within the range -- is it possible you would be arguing that this is not based on the guidelines?       Oh, it is, because of (a)(4).     It used to be -       -- because it says in the sentencing guidelines, Judge, you will apply the guideline, unless you find a circumstance the Commission did not adequately take into account and in respect to that, you may and must consult policy statements, but guidelines and other materials.     That is what it says. Okay? So take I am right on that.     Assume I am right.     You can disagree with me, and I will look into it.       I want an answer to my hypothetical, because I am trying to figure out how to think about it, and you will help me if you answer my hypothetical.       Yes, that's right.     That's what they wanted to do.     Okay?     Now, that is correct. But you can still have them.       You could still have them, but they allow them only for the purpose of where within the range the sentence will lie.     Okay?       Fine.       Correct.     Now I would like -- because if they wrote those words, C agreements are abolished, but for where within the range -- okay?     You agree it would be based on the guidelines.     Now what I'd like you to do is to look at section 6B, whatever that is.       Exactly.       You tell me how this differs from what I just said.       It's only if.     The words there are "only if."     It said should accept the recommended sentence or a plea agreement requiring imposition of a specific sentence only if the court is satisfied either that such sentence is appropriate within the guidelines, or departure.       I am?     I'm reading 6B1.3, I am reading commentary on the policy statement.       Yes.     I am reading the commentary on the -       Yes.       I think you're right.     You see that is why I am having such a hard time.     I am having a hard time because first I put myself back in the Commission days, and there the Commission did want to abolish C.       And then that is what it intended to do and that is what it said it did, but for what we are talking about.     Now, you first raised the question of did they have the authority to do that and I agree with you that that is a legitimate question.     I made you assume it away, but I think it is a legitimate question. Now we have the additional question of how Booker/Fanfan changes that and for what and when.     Do you see why I am puzzled and why I was asking you rather harshly to start with my hypothetical?
09-1036 +++$+++        Are we supposed to still pay some attention to what we think Congress would have intended?       All right.     And if the answer is "certainly," how likely do you think it is that Congress would have intended its statutes, in an ordinary case where two big businesses are suing each other and they've already had a day in court and now one of them wants to appeal and Congress writes in, if you miss the deadline, you can have it extended through excusable neglect, and you can even have it extended much later if nobody got a notice.     That's with two big businesses. But if you have someone who served his country and was wounded and has post-traumatic stress syndrome or schizophrenia, to that person you say -- who has never had a day in court -- if you don't meet the deadline, you are out, no matter how excusable it is. How -- who in Congress would have likely thought such a thing?       What is the relevance of that, if the veterans win?     I mean, perhaps they are entitled to win.     Is the idea that you would cut off their right to appeal because you are afraid they'd win?       But -- but don't we, throughout the statute books, try to work out from context, language, and objective purpose what a reasonable member of Congress would have intended, whether they thought about it or whether they didn't think about it, which would require X-rays into the brain that have not yet been invented?       But Bowles itself made - made a major point, which I thought was relevant. Though I didn't join it, I thought it was relevant.     And that is we look at the statute, if you are looking at the statute, and notice that there are exceptions written into it.     And the fact that there are exceptions written into it lends some support to the notion that we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it that weren't mentioned.     Now, that's something the Court seemed to emphasize. And here, when I looked at this statute, I noticed there are no exceptions written into it.     And, therefore, following Bowles rather than rejecting Bowles, it would seem that Bowles would support the reading of this statute to allow courts to read into it, because they don't mention anything themselves.       That's the main thing. Leaving that out for a second, if you -- if you thought there can't be a rule that governs all of the thousands of different -- or many different statutes, you should look at the context. So sometimes you will see that Congress, given the context, probably did want to give the court some leeway to make exceptions -- where, for example, it's no fault of the litigant -- and in other instances, they didn't. Now, you've listed -- and Bowles, I thought, left that open.     But -- but if it does leave it open, and I'm looking to those factors, you've mentioned one: That this is a long period of time, 120 days.     You're right about that. Is there anything else?       And what they found, one thing in the text, was that there were exceptions written in.     That cuts against you. One thing cuts for you; that's the length of time.     Is there anything else that cuts for you?     I just want to be sure I have all of the factors that you're weighing.       What is supposed to happen -- and I've probably seen this on page 16 of the Federal Circuit Bar's amicus brief.     They list about 30 or 40 cases where the veteran perhaps wasn't represented and maybe had some stress syndrome, whatever it is.     He just filed the paper in the wrong court, and the -- or the wrong agency, and that agency didn't get around to returning it to him in time so he could have met this deadline. What, in your opinion, is supposed to happen in those circumstances?     Just say too bad, you're out of luck; there we are, you got the wrong address; no recovery?       Well, in all these cases, actually, that they've raised in the brief, the veteran does get his appeal.       So they could do it again.       That's good.       These people in footnote 3, did they get their appeal or didn't they?       They did not?       Okay.     There's a problem.       And so if we're in a void and the language doesn't have the exceptions -- and I think you can distinguish it from these other cases, and you have older cases that says unless Congress is clear, read it as non-jurisdictional, and nobody could say it was inequitable -- or rather to the contrary, nobody could say it was equitable to follow your position here, why isn't there a simple remedy?     We take the opposite position?       Except that for purposes of this, it governs.     I'm just looking at the parts of it that did, in fact, make clear the special nature of the particular provision at issue in that case.       All these agency matters are matters where there has never been judicial input. This is review of an agency action.     The agency takes an action.     No judge has looked at this.     And the first time that you look at the rulemaking by the agency under the Hobbs Act, I guess, is when you go file it in the - in the court. So if a -- if a ruling against you here were to encompass a ruling under most review of agency action, would that be such a terribly unworkable thing?       Cases -- what was the other case that you said decades -- what is an example of a case where a person, for an incredible, equitable strong reason, such as the wind blew his paper -- I don't know -- some tremendously equitable, strong reason he wants review of an agency action -       Yes.     Right.     The dog ate the court, and the -- the -- there is a case which says there is no extension of a -- of a deadline to file for review of an agency action, no matter how equitable your case?     Which is our -- which is the Supreme Court case that holds that?     I -- I am not familiar with it.       Well, I'm only talking about agency actions, judicial review of agency action.       Well, I know the rule, but I'm just saying -       I know the rule.     I'm saying what's the case?     Stone -- I understand you can make a case of Stone.     Is there another?
09-10876 +++$+++        You might want that in order to show the machine says X, Y, Z, but that's only as good as the stuff that was put into it.     So you're going to have to show that this was his blood put into it.     And many, many people might have handled it, and there might be a routine so that they all check a box when it's sealed and they get it. Is it your understanding if you lose these cases -- this case that you then have to take into court all those people?       Yes, but the reason I asked the question is because I don't think it is normally contested.     It's normally a business record of some kind. However, what I was looking for is a distinction, because in the future I don't see why it wouldn't be contested, unless there's a distinction.       Are there States -- are there States that do require a -- a -- a prosecutor to produce everyone who has handled something in a chain of custody at a -- at a laboratory, a criminal -- you know, normal business?     Are there States that do require that? If so, could you tell me a couple, because I -       What about medical reports that are aimed at a particular known victim of a crime and thus will end up in trial?     For example, a graph, a graph which the nurse keeps, which is a statement by the nurse that the patient's temperature on such and such a day was 98.6 or whatever, and normally that graph would be introduced; but are there any States that wouldn't require -- would say, oh, no, you have to produce the nurse?     You have to produce the doctor for all medical records?     Which of course, are known by the keeper that they will be used at the criminal trial. Are there any States that require that?       Are there any States that require ordinary business records perhaps of the most ordinary kind, which always are statements that somebody did something on a particular day?     When those business records happen to be kept before with the knowledge that they'll probably be introduced at the trial, are there States that require the man or woman who made the business record to come into court?
09-1088 +++$+++        That in this case presents no -- no issue.     I mean, the -- if their holding is that in the -- in your habeas hearing in State court, the evidence presented in State court at that hearing was sufficient and was required -- required that State court to find that you win on this issue, the State court in holding to the contrary is objectively unreasonable, then you win.     And why are we all here?       I mention it not because it wouldn't -       That's -- again, it would be helpful -- maybe you can't do this from the top of your head, but when I looked at the Ninth Circuit en banc decision, I found a long discussion on page 79 following by Chief Judge Kozinski in dissent, from which I got the impression that the majority was not saying: We think the State court decision here was unreasonable or violated clearly established law, based on the record before the State court on habeas, State habeas. Now, you've just told me in the 70-page opinion by Judge Smith, there's a paragraph or something that says:     Even were all this issue out of it, the extra evidence, we still think that looking just at the evidence before the State court habeas, and just at their decision, we think in light of all these things you now are bringing up that that was a -- was an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, or at least was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts; in other words, satisfied (d). Where does it say that?     That would save me a lot of time if you know that off the top of your head.       Well, that's very good. (Laughter.)       Well, there you are, and I should have asked Justice Scalia beforehand. (Laughter.)       But what about -       Is -- I just want to be as clear as possible.     Justice Scalia read the sentence on page 35.     I read the heading from what Judge Kozinski says, "Our review is limited to the record presented in the state habeas petitions."     That's what he says. All right.     Now, you told me that the sentence he read means the majority there says if our record is limited to the record -- our review is limited to the record presented in the State habeas petitions, you still win.       Okay.     But that's not what it said.     It said exactly what Justice Scalia said it said, so -- which is talking about the evidence coming in under (e)(2) or something.     Now, I see a nightmare in front of me where I have to go through hundreds or thousands of pages to try to figure out whether they did or didn't mean our review is limited to the record presented in the State habeas petition.       And I can ask you, is that conceded on both sides?
09-11121 +++$+++        You would add none?     No others?     No other characteristics?       Well, I mean here.       There's a big sign jail cell, the door is unlocked.     When you want to leave, leave.     Is he in custody?       Is he in custody?     It's a jail cell, but a big sign, "Go ahead, leave, go when you want."     Is he free to leave?       Yeah, so do I.       I'll just tell you one other circumstance.       He only speaks Spanish.       Ukrainian is the only thing he speaks.     Now are you willing to take that into account?       Thank you.     Now, I'll say another fact.     Exactly the same, except there are very steep steps and he's in a wheelchair.     Are you willing to take that into account?       Okay.     Then why aren't you willing to take into account an ambiguous situation as was true in Alvarado, a tough situation where it's pretty unclear; he was brought there by his parents and there are all these things around that might suggest to a 20-year-old, yeah, you could leave, but to a 12-year-old, "no."     If the judge can take into account whether he's in a wheelchair, whether he just speaks Ukrainian, whether in fact a thing -- you have to swim through a pool and he doesn't know how to swim -- I mean, all kinds of things like that; why can't he take into account in a proper situation before he thinks he's in custody or not, things they both know including whether he's 8 years old or 22?       And it's obvious whether he's 8-year-old or 2 2, too.     I'll tell you that.       Right.     And you have to think like a Ukrainian speaker or think like a -- a -- a -- like a person who knows he's in a wheelchair before you know he can't get up those steep steps.       What is exactly the -- the difference?       I haven't said that.     What the opinion said, which unfortunately may mean nothing unless it's promoted to the status of majority, is you look to those factors that are relevant to, known to both policeman and the suspect, and are known to be relevant to the likelihood that a person -- a likely person, not him -- that are known likely relevant to an ordinary person's belief -- this kind of a person - that he thinks he's free to go.       That's all.     What's wrong with that?       Well, if it's right, then you -       You know the sentence I'm referring to in my dissent, presumably?     We hope.     When I have set forth the test which was not accepted.       I'm -- I live always in hope.       Well, I mean, the thing about known to both and relevant to a likely belief as to whether he's in custody or not.     Now, are you willing to accept that as a proper statement of the law?       Fine.       Well, then, perfect.       Why?     Why is that?     We've seen two cases that seem like blue moon, once in a blue moon.     Alvarado is a odd set of circumstances.     And what is the terrible thing, the awful thing that has to happen if the officer isn't sure whether this individual thinks he's in custody or not?     Suppose the officer just isn't sure.     What terrible thing happens?       What is the answer to that question?       Oh, well, you over Mirandize.     The terrible thing that happens is you have to give them a Miranda warning. Now -- now, that is the terrible thing. Now -- now -- now, why is that a burden on the criminal justice system that sometimes in ambiguous circumstances or because this kid is very young, he might not understand it quite as well, and the officer sees that, the kid sees it, and so the officer has to give him a Miranda warning.       Now, what happens to destroy the criminal justice system?     You can see from my overstatement, I tend to suspect nothing, but you tell me.       Why not the first thing, hey, kid, we're here talking, but you want to leave, just open the door and leave.     Go.     Nobody's keeping you here.     Why isn't that the first thing, if he's really free to go?       Oh, oh, oh, I see, I see. (Laughter.)       He's not free to leave? Okay.     Well, then, why not warn him?       Why?     Maybe you can explain this to me, too. You have a blind person there.     Everyone - you don't know how blind.     He's somewhat blind.     A deaf person.     How hard of hearing?     We're not sure.     So the policeman goes a little overboard.     You are free to leave, or shows it to him, or makes sure he gets it in. Okay?     Why is that so tough to do where you also have a 12-year-old?     If he really is free to leave, just make clear that he knows it.       But that isn't -- to me, anyway, that is not the question.     I don't think anybody is asking anybody to think like anything else.     All it is, when you face a younger child, and he is free to go, and you mean he's free to go, you just sort of err a little bit on the safe side and make sure he understands it.     That's all.     Nobody has to think like anybody.     All they have to think is let's err somewhat on the safe side.     Now why is that tough?
09-11311 +++$+++        Am I right about -- when you replied to Justice Scalia, I thought that he had said that we were dealing with a statute, and you seemed to agree, that said it is a crime to flee a policeman after being ordered to stop.     But I thought we were dealing with a statute that says it is a crime to flee a policeman after being ordered to stop, in a vehicle.       And so you're -- okay.       Suppose you have one of 36 States which treat this -- treat the general offense as a misdemeanor and then make it a felony if you put somebody at risk.     Just reading that statute, you'd think those 36 States, when they have the general offense, do something where the guy acted pretty trivially; and where it's a felony, he actually put somebody at risk, sped off -- wouldn't that be your normal instinct in just guessing from the -- from the language?       How are we supposed to treat those, where there's a misdemeanor -       In your opinion, it's just a misdemeanor, we also treat it the same way; say it's a violent felony?       All right.     Then that's actually my question.     Are we supposed to, in this Federal statute, try to track whether it's a misdemeanor, what the language is?     We're going to have a nightmare of a Federal law for States to -- for judges to figure this out.     I mean, every little variation in thousands and thousands of possible variations could make a difference as to whether it's violent or not, depending on data which no one will have.
09-11328 +++$+++        Is there -- is there anything to be said for simplicity?     The normal rule is when the police violate the Fourth Amendment you exclude the evidence.     That's the rule.     Then there are some exceptions, good faith, et cetera.     But that's the normal rule. You have a new law in this Court.     The new law says, now this is a violation; we didn't previously think it is, but it is; and that applies to the case in front us and to other cases on direct appeal.     The reason that's simple is that's what we've always done. And somebody says let's make an exception here, bring in the exception, good faith, and we say no.     Why?     Not because any of the policy arguments are wrong, but just because, as this last 40 minutes demonstrates, once we do that it's so complicated, only 14 people are going to understand it and they're not going to understand it, either.       That's very optimistic. (Laughter.)       So that's why, isn't it - that's why the normal rule has been that the person litigating the case gets the advantage of the new rule, as do other people whose initial appeals are not final, and there we are.     That's a rule existing, I guess, for a long time.     I guess these other people have to have raised the question in their case.     They have to have asked for it.     They can't -- they have to follow normal rules.     Has that caused havoc, or has that caused things -- the legal system, even before -       I would have thought it was more for this Court, actually, anyway.     I don't know if it has to be the words "overruling."     My recollection was:     Has the Court created a new rule of law?     I think it goes back to Cardozo, Sunburst or something, that if the Court creates a new rule of law, then does it apply prospective, retroactively?     And the worked-out position was it applies retroactively, but to the litigant and to those whose appeals are not final if they raised it.       And you want to change that, it seems to me.       You're hiving off the - the suppression.     I understand.
09-115 +++$+++        The main -- the main anomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber made, that it's a fairly careful balance.     There are a group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or that they're legal.     Now, think of that category. Congress has passed a statute that gives the employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal hiring.     It's absolutely balanced.     A $1,000 fine for the one, a $1,000 fine for the other. So Arizona comes along and says:     I'll tell you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to you?     Nothing.     But if you hire an illegal immigrant, your business is dead. That's just one thing they do.     Now, how can you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination against people because of their appearance or accent - how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law? If you're a businessman, every incentive under that law is to call close questions against hiring this person.     Under the Federal law, every incentive is to look at it carefully.       Is the I-9 -- I do have a question on the I-9.     I'm not certain.     I thought under Federal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't certain, but the employee says here's my Social Security card, here's the driver's license.     The employer looks at that, he's home free; is that right? But under Federal -- under your law, under Arizona law, he's not home free, and, moreover - because he -- it may -- he's not home free.     He still could be prosecuted.     Is that right or not?       So if he shows the driver's license -- under -- under Arizona law, if the -- if he shows a driver's license and Social Security card, the worker, the employer looks at it, the employer cannot be prosecuted?       Yes or no?       All right.     So -- I thought in reading it that it creates some kind of presumption, but he is not home free?       But under Federal law he is home free.       So then he's home free? Look, I don't -- I'm trying to understand.     Maybe it's not enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law requires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is. And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the cases where the notice is this guy is not authorized; we don't have any record that he's authorized to work -- 20 percent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to work. So the employer who follows that is really going to fire 20 percent of the people who will be absolutely entitled to work.     And so I'd just like you to address those points, as you wish.       If they fail to do it, then they cannot receive any, quote, "grant, loan, or performance-based incentive," end quote, from the State. That's what the law says, isn't it?       All right.     I would think then the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes, there is that penalty.     It isn't simply hortatory.       You don't go to jail.       What you do is you lose any grant, loan, or performance-based incentive.     Is that right?       Now, what I was trying to get is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal law says, if you look at the driver's license and Social Security card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer has established an affirmative defense and has not violated the law.     That's what it says.     You know the cite -- 27a or whatever.     Okay?     That's the Federal law. Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe there's another place I should read -- is it says, on determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the court -- the court shall consider the Federal Government's determination.     It creates a rebuttable presumption.     That means it might be rebutted.     Okay? So I see a difference there.     And the reason that that's relevant is because, my first question, if you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50. I better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know, da, da, da.     And it's not that hard.     I just look at the driver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da.     Okay?     So same both ways. Your law:     Employer, look at the driver's license and Social Security, you are not home free. Employer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your business is finished.     But what happens if I discriminate?     Under our law?     Nothing. Now, that was the original point they made. That's why I brought up this question of difference in standards.     And I want to be absolutely clear what your answer to that is.       Well, where?     Where is it in the statute, then?     Because what I read were the words "rebuttable presumption," and I might be reading the wrong words.       So tell me where it is.       Okay.     So the -       Okay, thank you.     I see that.       The main point -- I mean, I'll check that.     I think maybe I was mistaken, perhaps, in that I was looking at the other section.       But then we're still stuck with this enormous discrepancy in penalty.     I mean, I'm characterizing it as enormous, but it seems like the - you know, it's even on discrimination versus under the Federal law.     It's not even -- your business is out to lunch, gone, and on the other side it has nothing.     What about that one?       The savings clause itself, the word "licensing" -- not everyone looks at this, but I did look at the legislative history.     And when you look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it seems to me that that paragraph says what it means.     It says precisely what it is.     It says -- the first thing it says is that, look, if you're found to have violated this -- where is it?     It's page -- there it is. Suppose somebody has been found to have violated the sanctions provision in the Federal legislation.     Now, you've found -- he has been found by the Federal Government.     Then what the State does, it can revoke his license.     Okay?     That's one thing.     And the second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to pre-empt "'fitness to do business laws,' such as State farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws."     In other words, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses, and that's why this licensing thing was there.     And the very next part of this Federal law are conforming amendments, and those conforming amendments apply to departments of government that were concerned with maintaining State farm labor contractor laws. Now, I grant you, you have to go beyond the text, but some of us do because we get enlightenment. And going beyond that text, it seems to me we should follow what that House report says.     Now, what is your response to that?       Yes, I've got -       I said yes, I've got broad licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look at their explanation as to why they put those words there.
09-11556 +++$+++        He made a mistake and said I'm driving the car.       He made a mistake.     He said in court:     I was driving the core -- car.     He never should have said it.     All right, now once he said it, now we know he's driving the car.       So now you're saying why does this case even come up?     Because once you have his name, the second he said it in court you could go up looking his -- you could go look at his -- his records anyway; you could find all these -- the facts about him which I guess could you bring in.       So this case shouldn't be a special rule, it should just be a case of -- what is it called?     It's a doctrine, you would have found it anyway; inevitable discovery.       But they're only inevitably discovered if he makes a mistake of saying what his name is.     No, no, not that -- the mistake of saying:     I was driving the car.     And then, as Justice Scalia pointed out, maybe you could suppress that, so it would -- it would -       Wait.     One -       Why is -       Why?     The facts of this case, I find confusing.     Let's imagine the policeman goes with a hatchet and breaks into somebody's house illegally.       And there, he sees on the desk the name is Dagwood.     With other information, he goes to a certain alley and starts shouting "Dagwood" and people shower him with drugs.     You have no doubt, if that is the fruit of the poisonous tree, an out, correct?       I mean, that's how they - they knew the name, they got the evidence, they get to the place.     Without the name, they wouldn't have gotten the drugs.       Okay.     Out, right?       Yes, illegally.     Very illegally.       His name.       Yes, correct.       I just wondered if you were going to also say in my example, which I could make more realistic with more time, which you don't want to give me, the -- but -- that he uses the name, and as a result gets all kinds of evidence in the form of drugs, murder victims, whatever you want.     Have you any doubt that that would be suppressible?       They're not suppressible simply because you get them through a name?     You break into a house, get a name; as a result of the name, you know what criminal enterprise to go to; as a result of that criminal enterprise going to, you get every evidence under the sun, absolute direct connection.     And you say that's not suppressible?       Okay, okay.     I just wanted to know the ultimate response.       Now assume it's the opposite response.     If it's the opposite response, for state of argument, how is it any different whether he's showered with drugs or showered with government records?       I know.     I wanted you to assume the opposite.     I got -- you win if my hypothetical -- if it's not even drugs, it's not even government records.     But if it is drugs, why isn't it government records?     This won't hurt you very much, because often there will be an alternative source, but suppose there isn't.     Why are government records different from drugs?
09-1156 +++$+++        How would you write - look, I'm asking how do you write this, because what - where I think where the other side has a point is if - with these -- this is a big class of these kinds of things, you know, vitamins, all kinds of things like that, and if we say that they have to disclose too much, what will happen is people won't pay attention to it, you know. And if -- if you have, you know, 4,000 pages of small print saying everything that was ever reported, what really happens in -- in such instances is the public pays no attention, and they think -- and it will hide the things that are actually important. So how would you write some words - assuming that you're right, that their test is wrong - but how would you write some words that will put a disclosure obligation such that it's not going to be overkill and it is going to get incidents that rise above the background noise, and those are the incidents that are -- that would be significant for a reasonable investor?       Okay, I'll go back and read what you have just said, and -- I will, because it will be in the transcript, and -- and the -- this case -- I -- you are very good, your clients and the lawyers -       -- at writing complaints. All right?     So they've alleged in this complaint everything they can show, and I -- I suspect -- and during the class period.     And what it doesn't say is that very helpful chart that you put in the brief, in the pocket.     It doesn't say they ever showed that to the company.     All it says is there was a phone call and this individual from -- from Colorado said something, which it doesn't specify, about zinc and the -- and the number of deaths.       Okay.     I get that.     Can I just ask you one question in response to -- just picking up on the last -- what about the need for a, quote, "strong inference of scienter," end quote, and does this complaint show more than a borderline situation where it doesn't strongly infer that the person intended to mislead the defendant?     What about that argument?       Well, page 49 of their brief -- they have two pages on it -- it does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.       No, no, I mean -- I just want to know why -- if their inference on materiality is enough to survive the background noise reply, is it enough to show a strong inference that they did do this intending to mislead, a strong inference of scienter?
09-1159 +++$+++        Well, though -       Well, that's where I exactly am.     I mean, the -- the brief that I found very, very interesting is that filed by the Association of American Universities and the Advancement For Science and the Council on Education, and they seem to take the line that you are -- I don't know how far you want to pursue it. They say the strongest analogy is with government employees, and if you look at government employees the basic rule is, the Federal Government paid for it, they should have the invention.     And the way they do it is not to deny the employee the right to have the invention, but they insist upon an assignment, assignment of an exclusive license. And there are cases which are cited here that suggest that, even if the employee tries to run his way around that and simply goes and before the government can get it assigns the interest to a third party, that that third party assignment is void as a matter of public policy; and that the assignment to the government of the exclusive right is valid as a matter of law, a legal implication from the executive order in the circumstance. That brings me back to where Justice Ginsburg was, and Justice Kennedy.     The analogy is so strong.     The government has paid for it.     There is a statute here that really seems to assume, though not explicitly say, that the universities will have title - that we simply copy what happened in this other area and say that an effort to assign by the employee in contravention of what this statute takes as its basic assumption, and a contract, is void as a matter of public policy, because the exclusive license is assumed to be assumed -- to be assigned to the university, though I don't need the second part; for this case, the first part suffices.       Is that before the executive order or after?       No, no.     I understand that.       And if the employee seeks to assign to a third party in contravention of his agreement, rules and regulations, et cetera, what happens to that assignment?       The facts are that he was supposed to give it to -       No, there's no -- what there is, is an agreement with the government that says any invention you will assign to the government.     That's the agreement.       And now, in violation of that agreement, he assigns it to a third party.     What happens to that assignment?       And what the Court said - my reading of it, must be yours -- is in the cases they cite, that assignment to the third party is void as a matter of law because it's contrary to public policy. That was my reading of it, and I'm questioning you about that because I might not have read it correctly.       Well, you have -- you have here L-I v.     Montgomery, Li v. Montgomery -       Well, am I right or not in your opinion.       Yes, and then your clients would be out there arguing, oh, but you, see you can't assign a future interests in the fruits from black acre; I mean, you can promise to do it, but black acre isn't even around yet.     And so when somebody ran in and got those fruits, well, then now we have a fight; and in law the second person wins, and in equity maybe the first person can get an injunction.     I don't know.     But I guess people would raise that kind of argument, wouldn't they?       So if fact -       The reason it's relevant you to, of course, if that's so, Senator Bayh and Senator Dole passed a law which could so easily be subverted by individual inventions and third-party companies that there might be a large class of cases where neither the university nor the government would actually get much of a benefit from research that the taxpayer had funded.       Because?       Because most people perhaps thought that they had made a valid assignment.       But it's also remarkable the other way, that here we have many statutes that took the principle that when the government pays for an invention, the invention vests in the government.     Now, there's that statute, that background.     Not all of them, but some.     NASA, various others.       All right, that's fine.       Yes, I know that; I know that; that isn't my point.       My point is that it's somewhat remarkable because of this new statute, now that happens to only to inventions in those areas that are inventions of the contractor who, by the way, invents nothing.     Human beings invent things, not entities like universities.       And on your view what that means is it applies to nothing.     It only applies to those things that the contractor freely or not freely decides to get from his employee -- if he uses the right words and so forth. That also seems a little surprising, that there could be such a hole in what used to be public ownership of such matters.     I'm not -- I don't mean to be -- I started off sounding a little sarcastic.     I didn't mean to be.     I mean to be -- serious question.       Your answer is not as bad as I think.       What about -- what about the provision that says there shall be -- this is a provision of the law, that the universities are supposed to enter into contracts, funding contracts with the government to make this thing effective. Hmm -- effective.     Effective for what? Effective just to apply to some of the things that universities got money to pay for?     Or to a lot of them, to all of them?
09-1163 +++$+++        What happens -- I'm just curious -- on -- if you classify -- suppose you have a document, "in case of emergency, these are the evacuation procedures" of a big Federal building.     And now you want to show that to the firemen, but you don't want it to be in the newspaper.     All right.     And the firemen don't have classifications, and they aren't cleared.       But I guess if -- in order to see it, they'd have to be cleared.       How long does it take, approximately, roughly, to clear a fireman so that he could, in fact, see the evacuation manual from the Federal building?       Can you give me a rough idea?       All right.     Thank you.       Thank you.     Right.       If you couldn't go return to Congress and you had to classify documents falling into the category that you previously thought dealt with in Crooker, how long would that take?     How many documents would you guess there were in the Federal Government?     Millions?     Thousands?       That wasn't my question. My question did not concern those documents that were requested.     It concerns the category of documents that might be requested -       -- which is every document that might be requested.       And I wonder if it ranges in the millions, tens of millions, hundreds of thousands, 5,000, or if it -
09-1205 +++$+++ 
09-1227 +++$+++        That single sentence doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out.     It doesn't seem to refer to just all Tenth Amendment claims. There's a footnote and it talks about no standing in this suit. Then if you look back at the lower court case, it seemed to be referring to a particular argument where the challengers had said the Property Clause doesn't give authority to the government to pass this. The reply was, that was true in Alabama, and the Court said it was okay.     Then the challengers say:     Oh, but Alabama agreed.     And then Georgia doesn't agree.     And it was in that context that Georgia says it doesn't make any difference. But if Georgia was going to disagree or agree, if that's what it turned on, we better have Georgia say whether they agree or disagree, and not have people who aren't Georgia.     That's what he seems to be saying to me at the moment. If I'm right, what's comparable to that in this case?     Is there some claim that she's making that it would be constitutional if they agreed in the State and it wouldn't be if not?     I don't think so.     I think she means it's constitutional irrespective.       Yes.     Yes.     So if that's so, then how can we take this sentence as barred?       Yes.     It just says "in this case."       No, he cites.     He gives a footnote and you read the page and you get an idea.
09-1233 +++$+++        What is -- what is the number?     I mean, I -- I was puzzled by the same thing that Justice Sotomayor was.     I read, on page 253 of the appendix, a conclusion where the district court said it is our conclusion that they can reduce this by how many people?     What is it -- 30,000?     It's a lot.       Thirty-five thousand.     That this could be done safely.       Preceding page, whatever that was -- I have it -- it was 253.       There are about six pages where they summarize evidence from all kinds of criminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000 technical parole violators that are being sent to prison who haven't committed additional crimes, and they could perhaps be released from some of the time that they're spending in prison.     Then they go on to this good time, which would, I guess, lead to people who are 50 years old or 60 years old who have been in prison for 40 years would be released at age 55 instead of age 75.     I guess there's some category there.       Then they had several other things.     Okay.     Now, what are some facts about that?       Is there any likelihood -       Is there any evidence on -- I -- I see their suggestions that the technical parole violators go elsewhere -       -- that the elderly and infirm prisoners -       -- some of them be released.       The good time credits for older people would have effect, be increased, and also, halfway houses and other kinds of prison facilities which used to be called less -- less physically restrictive punishments, or taking the money you save and building new prisons.     Okay, that seems to be the gamut. Is there any evidence, statistically or otherwise -- because it used to be that States did rely on halfway houses, that relied upon -- they relied upon certain camps -- prison camps -       -- for example, and some of them were pretty tough.     And there were a whole range of what used to be called intermediate punishments.       All right.     Is there any statistical evidence on the part -- on the point that is -- that Justice Alito raised -       -- as to whether these did or did not result in higher crime rates?
09-1272 +++$+++        That if that's reasonable foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the Fourth Amendment.     But we have the Second Circuit that says as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it - lawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some kind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper test; and we have the Fourth and Eighth circuits that yet have some different kind of test. And one of the things I'd be interested in hearing your view on at some point is just what the Chief Justice said, that assuming from your point of view this is a hypothetical case, nonetheless we would like your view on which of those tests or some other test is the appropriate test and why.     That was the question he started with and Justice Kennedy started with, and I'd also be interested in your view on that.       But you said -- just add on to that.     Look, the question presented that they raised: Which of the five tests currently being used by the U.S. court of appeals is proper?     Now, you've said something about your view on that, but I'd like you to say anything else you'd like to say about that, which of the five tests, or some sixth test if you like, and you tell me the words that you would like us to use when we answer that question.       Which is?       No, no, no.     But the test you're using there, the key word is "unreasonable."       Okay.     And the reason you choose the word "unreasonable" rather than the Second Circuit's test of "unlawful" is?       But your test is -- I mean, it's not wild.     It just says it says "unreasonable" in the Fourth Amendment.     Probably when they act lawfully, they are acting reasonably and not unreasonably, but it could be sometimes they're not.     That's your view?       No test.     All right.
09-1273 +++$+++        Well, that's true -- that's true, you know, of -- I was thinking maximum resale price maintenance.     You could -- the distributor and the manufacturer agree on the maximum resale price.     Pretty unlikely that they intend the consumers who are intended to benefit to be able to have a lawsuit.     And I think, well, gee, I don't know.     And what the Government is arguing is, sure, the point you make favors you, but they say there are two major points here that favor them about background.     I want to hear what your reply is. One of them is Congress, in the statute that it incorporated here, didn't want a private person to be able to enforce it.     And the second one is it's going to create a mess.     All right?     So they say those are two background features here that favor them. So what's your response?       What do you think about -- is the -- I'm not sure I'm right at all here, but as I understand the development of this argument today, it's open to you and the other 57 counties to go to the State AG, and you say you bring the lawsuit, okay?     Or make us -- make me -- the lawyer says make me an assistant AG for this purpose.     And I launch the lawsuit in the name of California, and then I can get to the same place. What do you think of that?
09-1279 +++$+++        Are there any examples that you have?     That is, in the last 35 years, has there been any instance where the Justice Department or some other law enforcement agency compiled a file for law enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but it might interfere with that organization's strategy, and so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or something, was very upset about it? Did you find a single example or a thousand examples?     Or how many examples did you find of that happening?       Well, one reason might be that this has really never been a problem because all the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these organizations that have interests in privacy are actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.       This may be the first one. That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things you would have looked for is an example of a real problem of the kind you're talking about.     I'm not saying you don't have one.     I would just like to know if you found any, and what they are, so I could read them.       I mean, one possible reason you don't find them is because it's very rare that a law enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy. There might not be too many such records. It -- another reason might be is that they don't really care.     Another reason might be -- I don't know. But if you haven't found any examples, what we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg of the other instance, where the -- what was that first one?       I'd like to know about the example.     What was the first one again?       They're worried about saying something mean about a regulator.     Okay.     Yes, fine.     Are there examples of that?     Is this the first one, and what's the empirical state?
09-1298 +++$+++        How do you -       So it isn't -- it isn't a big practical problem.     All right.     Let me ask then, I was -- misimpression.     Would you go back to Justice Kennedy's question for a minute?     I'm -- I -- I don't quite see -- if you would discuss it a little bit -- how you do this as a matter of constitutional law, because the Due Process Clause is tied to fundamental unfairness, and I think the answer has to be in this kind of circumstance, secret block or not, it depends. It depends on many things. So, would you write this as a matter of constitutional law?     Would it -- shouldn't it be written as a matter of Federal common law of contracts? Shouldn't it be written as an exposition of the superior knowledge doctrine, which seems totally open to it? And -- or shouldn't it be written as a matter of discovery law, which is what the district judge who ended up thinking -- the Court of Claims judge says, gee, I don't really know. I mean, that's how I read it.     How would you -- would you speak about this for a minute?
09-1343 +++$+++        Additional conduct?       What I have written down in my notes, which you can add to -       -- is that there are three things that happened.     One -- it's the equivalent of the potter.     One thing that happened, we have to take it as, I think, an independent company, whether you want to call them a distributor or not.     I didn't see a difference there.     An independent company goes to a firm somewhere in the world and says:     I will buy your product and sell it in the United States.     And the guy says good.     And that's true whether it's a woman's cooperative in southern India or whether it's the biggest company in the world, okay?     That's the first thing. The second thing is that an executive of that company went to seven trade shows in the United States. And the third thing is that two, three, or four machines ended up in New Jersey. Now, is there anything other than that?     And there's a lot of rhetoric, and there are all kinds of characterizations, but when I looked for facts, I found those three, and I want to be sure I have them all.       I do.     Now, then my question following from that, if I have those are the three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said.     It said in worldwide markets this is a good thing.     I think I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese development, I'm worried about development everywhere. We have a lot of small businesses.     And I'd worry - now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd worry about a rule of law that subjects every small business in every developing company -- in every developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50 States simply because they agreed to sell to an independent company who is going to sell to America, plus your two factors. And really the third is none, because if it hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no accident.       Now, that's my basic concern here.       Yes.     Okay, but you see what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's going to work or develop if in fact every small business everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here, rather than making the accident victim go there. Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but the other is also tough.     So -- so that's -- that's sort of the -- I'm sketching out my concerns here.     You -       All right.       What would you say?       Yes.       Trade shows.       Well, that's the same as the first; that's a sale to the entity.       We do?     We do?     So if someone goes into a shop in West Virginia and buys a thousand pots and says I'm going to sell them in Madras, or I might sell them anywhere in the world -       -- and then that manufacturer, that potter in West Virginia, now has to go to wherever he ends up -- wherever that pot ends up?       Ah.     Ah.       We turn it on that?     We turn it on whether the independent buyer -- the independent buyer walked into the shop or whether the seller found that there was an independent buyer?     Is that what this case should turn on? I mean, I'm nervous.     I see a lot of rather deep issues here, and I -- that's what are making me nervous.       I want to -       You've thought about it more than I.     So -       What if -       Yes, well -       But what I'm thinking is this -- this area of law has treated States as if they're foreign countries, in a certain way analogous to.     If that -- and I'm trying to -- let me ask:     What you said at one point, that if an independent company comes to a business, however small, in the United States and says give us some of your product, we're going to sell it everywhere in the world we can, fine.     And they do. A couple go -- get into some very -- Burma or whatever, Myanmar.     And right now, it's the law that consumers in all those countries sue in that country if they're hurt.     Is that really the law?     Is there something you can cite me to on that?       And what does it -- what does it say?       Yes, and we're one?       And are we one?       Did you refer to that?     Do you have a citation to that in -       -- in your brief?       All right.     What about today, is there any difference between the trade show - and he did show up at seven trade shows.     I -- I mean, the manufacturer here had a representative at several trade shows, you're right.       That's right.     Twenty - no, well, the record said seven.       Is that in the record?       Okay.     All right.     Is there a difference between that, do you think, and -- I just read in the paper the other day there's some Ethiopian or some foreign country -- it's a very poor country - and they're selling goats, and they're sending some to the United States for some kind of festival purpose or something.     Now, he said I have a site on the Internet. All right. Now, all of these people, however small, I mean, many, many will have Internet sites, and some of them might have an Internet site that's accessed by American buyers, as this man did.       All right.     Is there any difference between that and your trade shows?       Yes.       No, no, don't use the characterization.     I mean, I'm -- see, I'm trying to figure out does this count as purposefully availed?       Okay.     So the answer is going to be, in this case, if we say you win -       -- then everyone with a - with a -- everyone with an Internet site who also sells to a buyer who says anywhere in the world, perhaps -- I don't know how far that reaches -- seems pretty filled with implications.       But it's the same, you think?     It's the same -- I thought it might -
09-1403 +++$+++        Can I -- I'm trying this question out.     Try to give me your best answer.     If I don't have it clear enough, just forgive it and go on to another.     As I'm understanding this case with Basic, the idea is there is a presumption.     Somebody lies and says there's an oil well I found oil in.     A lot of people buy on the stock market.     It turns out there was no oil, and a lot of people say they lost money.     All right. The point of the stock market presumption is to say:     Smith, you're a typical plaintiff and this presumption is going to help you by the following. We're going to say what happened to the typical person on the stock market during that period happened to you, and there are a lot of people who bought and sold on the stork market.     And that's why efficient markets is needed to show at the certification stage, because if there weren't certification -- if that isn't shown, the whole thing falls apart. But what you're just saying on terms of whether the revelation lowered the price has nothing to do with the question of what happened to the typical person, Smith, happened to you, nothing to do with it. It has to do with whether anybody was hurt.     Now, that has nothing to do with the certification stage.     That's the win or lose stage. Now, that's how I'm understanding it at the moment.     So what's wrong with the way I understand it?       Does your rule apply in all fraud cases?     That is, a thousand farmers say, Mr. Jackson was our common buying agent, and the defendant lied to Mr. Jackson, and he relied on the lie. It is a common issue whether he relied on the lie or he didn't rely on the lie.     I can understand somebody saying at the certification stage they have to see whether he's really a common agent.     But let's imagine that's assumed.     The only question left is, did he rely or not rely? Is that a question for the merits or is that a question for the common -- for the -       So you're saying in the case that I just gave you reliance is for the merits?       Whether he really relied or didn't rely, the common agent is for the merits?       Is that -- is that your answer is?       No.     A thousand people say Mr. Jackson is our common buying agent, and the defendant lied to this common buying agent, and he represented us.     Relied on that.     I'm asking if you that issue of reliance in an appropriate case is for the certification stage?       Yes.       And they also have to prove there is a lie?       Okay.
09-1454 +++$+++        Same circumstance.     Was there a seizure?     No -- no professor -- no policeman?       School nurse?       Seizure?       And so, it's not a seizure if exactly the same thing happens but there is no outside person there, but it is a seizure if there's an outside person?       That's the rule as to whether there's a seizure?       No, no, no, whether there's a seizure?       Okay.     What makes it a seizure?     Go inside and speak to the principal, I saw you push the child at recess.     We want to find out who was pushing you.     Go inside and talk to the principal. Seizure?       Everybody is going to stay minutes after class, too much talking today.     Seizure?       Well, that's what I need to know, because I don't know see if there is no seizure, how it could have been an unreasonable thing, if there isn't even a seizure.       You're not free to leave class.       Go to the principal's office.     Too much talking.       Suppose that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted, while indicating in an opinion some of the questions that we find difficult such, for example, as the seizure question, et cetera; what kind of impact would that have in your opinion?       Yes, if -- while indicating the reasons being in part that there are difficult questions here, suggesting what they are.     What would the -- impact would that have?
09-1476 +++$+++  
09-1498 +++$+++        It matters because the trial judges have to know what to do, and while your reading might fit the language in ordinary English better, I think it does. It's also possible to read those words "delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time are excluded from accounting.     Now, the virtue of that is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying to figure out what causes what.
09-150 +++$+++        -- involves something like that, if -- what keeps that out?     I mean, assuming that a State law or the Federal Rules of Evidence admit it as an exception to the hearsay rule, why should the Confrontation Clause bar it?     There is not great likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's affidavit, it is going to be introduced per se into the trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would we want to keep it out?     That's the part that I do not understand.       Federal -- I mean, under the Federal Constitution.       Suppose I think we didn't. Suppose I happen to think -       I'd like to hear your answer because I don't think we decided it in Crawford.       But does it mean -- does it mean that the individual is thinking this may be used - there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be used at trial?     Or it may just happen to turn out?     I mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the situation?     When I looked into history I thought -- I'm not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand there have been situations where the Court's gone back to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it a little bit.     I think that that goal could be open to us. So I want to know what the basic reason is that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say, an investigation.     There's an investigation of a crime, and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes some statements just generally that help the investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as co-conspiracy, okay? What in the Constitution, what functional principle, is there that says we should keep that out of Court?       Is it all hearsay?     Now, all -- all hearsay evidence, despite State or Federal rule makers saying there are exceptions where the trustworthiness is sufficient, such as co-confederates, confederates, all of that's wiped out by Crawford and the -       Of course, what I'm looking for now because I'm -- is whether there's any sense to that.     What is the constitutional rationale?     I joined Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended as I have written it.       So now you've just got what I'm looking for.     What I'm looking for is I can go into Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial and the Marian judges.     And now what I need is a line. Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done, which seems just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar virtually all hearsay exception evidence, of which for 400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a lot in the courts.       What, in your view, is the correct line and why, most importantly why?       Is there any -- I'll try this -- I think you're just -- you don't like my - where I'm coming from, but -- and so you might not have an answer to this. But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and that line is dividing what I think of as the Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation, which I have in my mind as people going into a room and saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a letter, and they say "bye," and then they walk next door to the trial and introduce it.     I mean, that's Walter Raleigh, in my mind. And then, on the other side of the line, is an -- evidentiary rules that are basically in State cases run by the State.     And they sometimes let hearsay in, and they sometimes don't, and they make reliability, et cetera, judgments in developing their -- their decision as to how hearsay exceptions will work.     Okay? Now, why don't I like emergency to draw that?     The reason I don't like the word "emergency" is I think police do lots of things other than handle emergency and develop testimony. There's a range of things that you would describe as investigating the circumstance.     There's no danger.     There have been a string of robberies.     They go around and ask the grocery store people and everything what happened.     Now, I don't know why we should keep out evidence that, say, is given in that situation by a confederate.     It turns out he was the assistant -- why? And if I don't like that, I don't like the emergency rule as doing the -- as doing the work there, and I'm looking for something else. Now, you have my whole train of thought.     If you want to say, Judge, there is nothing but the emergency rule, you are perfectly free to say it.       They're not.     They're just asking -- all right.     Yes.     Go ahead.       Yes.     They're investigating.       Yes, yes, but in the past that situation you are describing arose only where there was a hearsay exception.     I would imagine most likely it would be the case of a confederate, someone who was part of the conspiracy.     So if I think if that's going to be the case, that probably will be admissible where this has bite.       And there be some others, excited utterances, maybe another.     Dying declarations are probably few and far between.     Baptismal certificates -       I know they did.     And what I'm saying is I'm finding that -- it seems to me that that line, if taken literally, would keep out exceptions to hearsay testimony, which have been well established in the United States for 200 years.     Baptismal certificates, statements of birth.       Confederates is the one I come back to.       Okay, okay.     I forgot -       Many -- I mean, like many cases there is language that takes -- that can take us far afield from the subject matter before us.     And I will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford. So I'm really asking about that scope and, in particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.
09-152 +++$+++        How does it do that?     Look, I think a difficulty I have is this.     Imagine vaccine X saves 10,000 lives, but inevitably 20 children will be killed.     That's inevitable.     Time period one. Five years passes.     The manufacturer now realizes he could save three of those five people.     All right.     Is there anything in the law that requires him to tell the FDA that that is so?       All right.     If there is nothing that requires him to tell the FDA what comes along, what I think your opponent is saying is at that moment, it is no longer an unavoidable harm and there is nothing in this statute that says that unavoidable harms -- that avoidable harms are taken away from the courts. So what is your response to -- what is your response to that?     He's saying all the unavoidable ones are taken away, but not the avoidable ones.     And now we have an example.     So what is your response to that?       If you want to read it especially to mean unavoidable and avoidable.     Let's assume you are right about that, or let's assume it is at least ambiguous.     If that's so, then what is your response to the question I raised before, that is:     That he says that if you allow judges and juries to decide only the question of avoidability, there will not be the harms that the childhood pediatricians thought there would be, because most people will go to the courts - to the vaccine court anyway.     There are very few such cases, and there will not be enough liability to drive manufacturers from the market. You heard him respond to that.     What is your response to that?       That's a minor point, but I thought if you went into the vaccine court you had to sign something saying you weren't going to go into a tort case.     I'm wrong about that?       Do they get the information from the manufacturers?     And -- I mean, would they find out if in fact there had been a change -       -- and it was now -- there is a safer alternative?       Suppose then that in - suppose I look into this, which I will do, the CDC and what they do.     And suppose I become convinced you are completely right, that this is a government agency that is top of this and the chances of something going wrong are very small and they will figure it all out, together with the manufacturers.     Suppose I conclude that. What do I do about this word unavoidable?       Now I can't say that the word unavoidable -- it's pretty hard to say that that word unavoidable means avoidable; and I am in fact - like to look to the purposes of this statute, that if something says "day" I can't say it means "night."     And so -- so what --what is it about this word that allows us to say that it's avoidable?       To show that -- remember they only want to say, because of special circumstances this is an avoidable -- this is an avoidable injury. I think I am right on that. And -- and so the best place to look in your opinion, for me to look, to show that this word unavoidable includes that avoidable claim, is where?       They are not lawyers; they are scientists.       So they may not use these exact words, but you are saying whatever word they use, what they have is an ongoing process to say this is the best vaccine available; is that right?       The committees have manufacturers on them and Government scientists and university people and others?       The committees have manufacturers and Government scientists and university professors and others?
09-1533 +++$+++        It's my understanding here that -- that the problem in this case -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is because cocaine can become -- can be a salt. People sniff it often, I guess, if it's a salt.     And that's bad.     And then there's a kind that's worse, that's freebase or crack, and that isn't a salt and it isn't a poodle and it isn't an acid.     It takes a base form, right?       And so that's why they have a higher punishment.     Then the odd problem is that maybe a cocaine leaf, but certainly cocaine paste, which are more primitive forms, also have a chemical-based solution, they too.     So they've written this statute that sounds like -- that sounds like "Who's your father's son who's not your brother?"     It takes a long time to figure it out. All right.     So would you have an objection -- and I wonder if the other side would have an objection -- if what we said this word "cocaine base" in (iii) means is that it is cocaine in the chemical form of a base after it has been processed beyond the stage of coca paste?     And that's how we read it.     That would seem to exempt the things they're most worried about, the paste and the leaves. And I'm not going to repeat the same stupid joke, poodles and fruits, but you see the point.     Is there any objection from the point of the government to define it in that way, or the other side?     And why?       No, I don't care how it was made.     All we do is test it.     Now, all we have to do is test it, and then we look to see if it's a leaf.     That isn't tough, I don't think.     And then we have to look and see if it's this yellow stuff that looks like paste, and I guess that isn't too tough, either. So those are the only things you have to do. You have to test it, look and see if it's a leaf, look and see if it's a paste.     Now, even the -- I mean, I say "even."     I mean, certainly the DEA could do that.       Certainly they could, right?       No, that's what I want to know.       We got that part.     Right.       That's fine.       Can you make it in -       But you define it in your brief, and this is very interesting to me -- you talk about it being a yellow substance that came directly from grinding up leaves, something like that.     You have the definition there.     It's written. Take that definition that you wrote, and what you've said that's very interesting to me that I would like to know, is that, that substance, in some significant amount of time is actually more addictive, more dangerous than the salt, which is ordinarily sniffed?     Now, is that what you're saying, because I received from this material the contrary impression. I had the impression that the yellow paste that comes from the leaf directly is, if anything, less addictive and less harmful, if anything, than the salt which you sniff.     Now, which is it?       Or if -       Go ahead.       So now if I want to find a citation for the authority that paste, yellow, made out of leaves is in fact more dangerous and Congress could have thought that than -- more dangerous than ordinary salt sniffed, I will read what?     Because that -- that -- I did have that wrong impression.       Well, what you've referred to, in other words.     I -- I mean, I trust your brief implicitly, but I don't know on the scientific matter or the congressional.     I would like to know what to read on that.       What page is that of the brief?     You don't have to read it.     I'll read it.       Okay, I'll read that. Thank you.
09-158 +++$+++               What you would have to say to follow his approach, is you would say:                  Judge, here is what you would do.         They're filing it from the second judgment.     Okay?   So it is not second or successive. But wait.      If there is a first judgment that says the same thing, then it is, in effect, the first judgment that counts. Now, what happens when there is a change? Well, to note the scope of the change, you would go to the habeas court and you would say, to the extent that that habeas court changed -- reversed -              -- or left open or told the lower court:     Do this over; to that extent, it is a new judgment.     And that -- that would get them where they want to go.             Wait.        Wait.    Wait.    Wait right there.    I would have read that to say that what he said was:   Vacate the sentencing part. Now, you say:         Well, vacate the sentencing part; fine.     Now we look at the second judgment, and we say:   It's a new judgment.            Oh, but it isn't.             Insofar as that habeas didn't tinker with it.         But they did tinker with it, because they vacated the sentencing part. Now, why doesn't that work?                    And his argument is, that works much easier for the judges, much easier for everybody, than to try to figure out whether a claim could have or couldn't have been raised, whether a sentence was changed from six years to five years, or who knows what we are going to get into; et cetera.             This argument -- I am making it up, but I mean, he doesn't have to apply these arguments -- but it seems to me that the argument against this is:     What you are proposing is too complicated.     There are thousands of these in the courts of appeals.     All you would like is you would like the court of appeals to look back and say:                    What part of the original sentence did the district court, habeas, vacate?             Not look into the reasons for it, et cetera.      Because once we start going into the reasons for it, the litigation is just going to mushroom.             And -- and, you know, you have this new witness but not that new witness, et cetera.    So his argument is one from simplicity.                    Start with the judgment.      Second, keep it the same insofar as the district court didn't vacate it.                      And deal with it as a new judgment, which it is, insofar as they did.               That's what they raised - your view is a simple rule, no matter how many judgments there are.               If this claim could have been raised and would have been fully adjudicated had it been, it's barred.               But if either it couldn't have been raised, or if it could have been raised and wouldn't have been fully adjudicated or was not fully adjudicated, not barred.               And applied to everything. Can we reconcile that with the language? Does it work in terms of the language?             One judgment.           One judgment.    Never come up on appeal.                     Yes, it did, the first one.     And let's see.          There were 15 issues that were raised.     They only answered -- you know, they answered one.     Now we go back and then five years later he wants to bring up a different one.                       Fine.   You can do it.     Not second or successive.             It -- it's there in the case.             It's one judgment.            He makes five claims.             The district court doesn't decide, for some reason, I don't know, number 3 or 4. Maybe I -- maybe it's not realistic, what I say.                        Let me think about it some more.             Full -- see, he filed his petition -- this would get rid of -- I think there are -- I am worried about that there are cases out there that say the opposite.         But we get rid of all those cases, if there are any, and you just say that he has not had the full opportunity to have the litigation on a claim that he did raise.             Or if he couldn't have raised it, it doesn't matter if there was one judgment forever.   He can raise it again and again, as long as he only does each one once, and they are not second or successive even if they appear in petitions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.                What happens if in the first trial, the lawyer thinks, you know, I have two claims here; one is mediocre and one is great.                       And I'm not going to win in the court of appeals unless I make the great one; just forget about the mediocre.                       And he brings it and he wins.         Okay?        Now he goes back.          Now can he make the mediocre one?              So he better put in everything.              And if he puts in everything and they don't reach the other ones, he's okay, because he can raise it again.
09-223 +++$+++                 That's all right.       It's in the jurisdictional amount.                They might want to -- in all the Court's cases, the challenger wanted -- he said: I don't care; either make them pay or give me my money back.              So that -- that should be your case, I would have thought.                  But you're not saying it so you can get into Federal court.                     Now, that's how I read it.    And that seems -- that's worrying to me.              The Establishment Clause, I would add, there is a lot of reason for thinking it's special in respect to standing, because there is no other way to challenge the Establishment Clause.                     And that is a long-festering disagreement within this Court, but I'm not sure you can apply these rules to everything else.             But you see what is worrying me.     What's worrying me is, is there are businesses all over the country and there's Federal tax law, too.    And suddenly people begin to think:                   Hey, this is a terrific idea; I am going to go through my competitor's tax returns and I will discover taxes they should have paid but didn't, and all of a sudden we will face a lot of lawsuits challenging other people's taxes. That's what is worrying.             And this is not true of the other cases.     What do you think of the other half of their argument?     I'll have to think about the standing thing to see if I want to press it or not.                     But the other half is:     Look at your case.                 Your case would just be like -- just like the other cases, if you just said: Give us a refund, as they did in the other cases. But you haven't said that, because that would run afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.                      Rather, what you have said is:     Raise their taxes.                  So the point of the State is:     Now, wait a minute.                 Leaving all of the things aside, you asked for other appropriate relief, and it's highly probable in such situations that a Court could -- would say:      Give them the exemption.                 And if it's going to say, give them the exemption, hey, this is now not within Hibbs.        So what's your response to that?              Why not?              No, no.          There's a lot of things they could say -              Of course.         Of course. Absolutely right.     That's what worrying me.                   That isn't the answer.     That's the question.                And -- and the - it's what Justice Kennedy said in respect to discrimination problems.           Usually, either remedy is at issue.   You can't control the remedy because you asked for all other appropriate relief.                   Ergo, it falls afoul of the Tax Injunction Act.             What's your response to that?                You didn't ask only for the other relief.     You asked for such other relief to which plaintiffs are entitled.           And what they say -- now I repeat the argument.       Okay.              So then, in your opinion, your next-door law firm, next to you, brings a case and says:   Mr. Fitch should pay $1,000 more taxes next year because he deducted $2,000 that was illegal.                    You see that?   You see?   Now I'm trying to bring it home.                   There is something wrong with this picture, and I can't quite put my finger on it.             I mean, your next-door neighbor in your business, which would be a competing law firm.              But they don't actually bring you into the case. (Laughter.)             Or why isn't this a Hibbs? You read the -- clearly the other side says to read the footnote, not as destroying the comity principle.                   You know, this is right on the merits.                   It still exists, comity.    And you say a strong case for withholding the -- the Federal court's jurisdiction on grounds of comity or withhold -- not hearing the case, is the natural remedy -- which is to give you a refund -- is available in State court.    Go apply for a refund.                 No problem. And that --- and the answer, you know, and then you don't get into all the problem of trying to assess somebody else's liability, et cetera.                   What is wrong with that, precisely?             Why not?               So not give it -- up to the State?   You could say give us a refund or raise their taxes, one or the other.          What's wrong with that?               If doesn't solve the problem for you if you get a refund?               Why not?               Why?               Well, no, no, you have it, too -- they -- they work it out, so it equally applies to everybody including your clients, so you are all on the same footing.    Now what is the problem with that?
09-291 +++$+++        But you couldn't win on that under Burlington.     I mean, I think that there are three separate issues here that have to be kept straight. No one can win in court unless they show there was a human being -- in this case, the woman - who suffered material -- who suffered serious harm, serious harm.     And serious harm is defined as materially adverse action which might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.     So unless she suffered that kind of serious harm, nobody wins. Then the next question is suppose, in the course of that, somebody else was hurt.     And the person aggrieved provision suggests, because of the history of the word "aggrieved," that more than just she can bring the lawsuit.     That's our first question. And then our third question is, if the second question is yes, why can't the whole world do it? At least the barber who doesn't get the haircut anymore because the person fired doesn't have any money or the landlord who can't get his rent or the -- you know, we can go on indefinitely.     Okay?       So why don't we get to the second question? The second question is -- the word "aggrieved" has a history.     I think it comes out of - what's the case?     It's -- I think it comes out of FCC v. Sanders Brothers, which is a 1940 case, which said that sometimes where there's a statute using the word "person aggrieved," that that means that a person can bring a lawsuit even though that person does not suffer injury of the type that the statute was meant to prevent against.       That was picked up by the APA.       It says "person aggrieved."       So we have a statute that says "person aggrieved."     Maybe it means it in a different sense, or maybe it means it in the APA sense, Sanders Brothers sense, which means, in principle, this plaintiff can sue.     Now, you can argue against that if you want, but, I mean, that's where I'm starting from. And then we can have the third part, which is:     Is there a way of limiting this?       You don't have to.     I'm - just a question. (Laughter.)       Quite a long question.       No, you don't -       -- but it would be pretty hard to do that, because it's in black and white here.       Now, that's -- that's why this is -- see, what Sanders Brothers did is the interest to be protected against had nothing to do with protecting competitors from competition.     The Court says that.     And it says:     But here is a competitor trying to protect himself from competition; can he bring a suit? Well, normally not.     But Congress used the word "person aggrieved" or "adversely affected," and, therefore, they can.     Now, that's the precedent that -- that -- that's harmful to you.     I'm not certain. What about the third part?     I have a suggestion, and I'd like your response, because I'm just playing with the thought:     That the way to limit this is to say that where a person is being used, person B is hurt because -- in order to retaliate against person A, okay?     That that is a person aggrieved where person B is being -- is hurt.     The injury, the injury to B, not to A, is the means of hurting A.     But where it is a consequence of hurting A, that doesn't fall within the statute. That gets rid of the bowling alley, it gets rid of the landlord, it gets rid of the shareholder, it gets rid of all the people who -- who are not the person retaliated against, but they suffer injury because he was retaliated against.     It keeps the people who are being used as a means.     They can bring the lawsuit.       If, in fact, you set in motion hurting Mrs. Smith, the child, the wife, even the coworker, though that would be hard to get past Burlington, if you do that in order to hurt A, to retaliate against A, B can bring the suit.     But if B is a person who is injured only because you retaliated A, that really wasn't the means, B can't bring a suit.       That is the problem with my theory. (Laughter.)       But there are -- I do -- I think that it isn't so hard to find, in some of the sources that Justice Ginsburg mentioned and others, instances where the only kinds of suits that have been allowed are where it was like a family member or was being used as a means, and there never have been cases where they allowed somebody who was just suffering consequent injury.     So it's quite possible I can be borne out, though I think your criticism is a pretty good one. (Laughter.)       I'm not sure why the employer's intent comes into this.     A is the person who is being retaliated against, and the issue would be: Did the employer take such action against B as the A would think, quite reasonably -- he'd have to reasonably think that the action that the employer took was retaliation, was meant to be -- whatever those words were -- was -- might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.       Well, you'd have to show he had a retaliatory intent, that's true, but that's true however he retaliates.
09-329 +++$+++        Why not?     Can't an agency interpret its own rules?     I thought there was a long line of cases, Udall v. -- whatever it was.     I mean, there are like 50 of them -       -- where an agency can interpret its own rules, and if it has authority to make the rule, it can decide that it means something different.     Why not?     Where -- where in the law does it say they can't do that?       But at the Board -- I mean, isn't there realism in this?     When you read what the Board later said in -- in these reports, you'd say, well, is this what the Board now thinks?     And what in the law prevents the Board, which is in charge of its own regulations, from telling us what it thinks, if it's in good faith and isn't making up some kind of ex-post rationalization?     That's the word used, you know, in the brief case.       It doesn't say "specific interest rate."     I mean, my understanding of it -- and I'm asking, so you can correct me if that isn't so -- is there's a regulation, Regulation Z.       And then the staff put out some commentary and says here's what that means, among other things:     That the creditor can increase the rate at its discretion, and you've got to give notice.     You have to give notice, but you have to give some more notice if the original notice does not include specific terms for an increase. And then they give an example.     Suppose the increase could occur under the creditor's contract reservation right to increase the periodic rate.       That's a little obscure. As I say it, I'm not sure what I'm talking about.     So then, later on, the Board puts out another -- not called official staff commentary, but they say:     We'll tell you what that specific -- word "specific" terms mean.     It means when they didn't say anything about the interest rate or they didn't say when in fact they were going to increase the interest rate from X to Y, then they didn't give specific notice. But they did give specific notice if they told you when it would increase, by default -- when you default.     And they did give specific notice when they told you what the maximum it would go up to was, like 8 percent or 18 or whatever it is.     Okay?     So that's the Board's interpretation of its official staff commentary, which in turn is an interpretation of the reg. So if we're supposed to defer to their interpretation of their own reg -- I mean, my goodness, wouldn't we defer like double to their own interpretation of their own staff commentary, which is an interpretation of a reg which they have an authority to issue under the -- you see my point. (Laughter.)       I mean, that would be an argument you could make.     You could say that -- that their interpretation here exceeds their authority under the statute.     Now, of course, if you're right about that, all this stuff goes out the window.       But it's a pretty hard argument to make that one, I think.
09-337 +++$+++              It's no mistake if you happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right party is?             Ever?             Has that ever happened to you?             Was there anything you didn't know?             No, I'm asking about this question, my hypothetical.             Was there anything you didn't know?             Correct.         Did you do it by mistake?     Yes, of course, you did.                It's happened to every human being.      There are millions of instances in which people do things by mistake where, in fact --             No, my wife does not make mistakes. (Laughter.)             I make mistakes, and sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so do you and so does everybody else.                   So I never heard of this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the facts.     But anyway, here we have a person who didn't know all the facts.       What the judge says is he should have known all the facts. Where in the record does he say he did know all the facts?             That's a different matter. My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay? But I didn't take it in.             So that's a different matter.   Where does it say that he did know the facts as opposed to he should have known the facts?             I just want the citations to the page.     I wasn't challenging you.                I just wanted the citations to the page --             -- where there s a finding that, in fact, he knew that this company called "Costa Cruise" in Italian is the same as the company called "Costa Cruise" in English?           I take it "Crociere" means "cruise."              Yes, yes.        One is called "Costa Cruise" in Italian and one is called "Costa Cruise" in English.     And I just want to know where it says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer, actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued the one that spells its name in Italian?              I didn't ask you that question.   I'm asking for a record citation as to where there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew that the Italian company called "Costa Cruise" was in fact the one he should have sued?              I ll write them down and look at them later.             I thought what the district court said was  impute  the knowledge.             Where does it say that? Where does it say that on 19a?             Well, I -- I know.      I would say in reading this, that both courts have made the most elementary mistake of the English language in thinking that when a person doesn't know something but should have known it, that that s inconsistent with a mistake. That's the very definition of a mistake.             Now, all I want is some citation from you that shows that isn't what they thought.               Well, that's the conclusion, and when I read two sentences down, it said they may have had constructive knowledge.            The word "constructive" to me, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what the word "constructive" to me means is not knowledge.               I'm on page 19a.               Constructive notice.               All right.       Then what is -- where is the page that it says that the plaintiff had actual, as opposed to imputed, knowledge?               Okay.             Well, I don't understand what the lawyer reading the ticket has to do with this question.              But I mean, if we're going to use it in English, there -- it's not hard to find instances where a person would know, but he'd still make a mistake.              And there's even a fortiori --              -- if he doesn't know, even if he should.              Isn't that true?              What possible reason is there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person?              Is there such a reason?              And I m just saying, did he do it by mistake?    If you were representing this person, would you want to sue the company that could give you some money if they are liable?               Or would you rather sue the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it? (Laughter.)              Well, I want to ask you about that, because in your brief you refer in your footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal Government 44101-44103.         So I looked those up.        I discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and you say you follow these requirements, that you shall establish under regulations of the FMC financial responsibility. And those regulations tell you that, at least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a written designation of a person in the United States as a legal agent for service of process, and they are referring to instances in which somebody on a ship suffered an accident. So since you say that you are complying with that, I would like to know the name and address of that person in the United States for whom you must send legal process, because if obviously that had been on the ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff would have sent the notice.             Well then, were you correct when you said in your -- in your brief that this company which you represent does comply with 44103?             It is relevant, I think, because it adds to the confusion if they are under a legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but they don't have it printed on the ticket.                And they get everybody mixed up by having the same name in English, or a very similar one, and announcing someone you re supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that person you re supposed to serve.                It's a mysterious person that you can't find.               It seems odd.    I d like to know what the explanation is of this.
09-338 +++$+++              So can -- what -- what is -- looking at -- can you take the converse of the question I asked your colleague on the other side, if you can remember it?       I'll -- do you see what I'm -- on the scale.    I mean, this is a fairly simple case.             What is wonderful about this case is there is no disagreement about the facts. We could write them in under two pages, just quoting exactly the notes and exactly what the colloquy was and note that the lawyer wasn't there.                  So there we are. Now, imagine that in front of you.                    You - it's easier for you to look up the cases than it is for him, because you want to find reversals, and all you have to do is you look and you try to see when the State courts, Federal courts have said there was not manifest necessity. So I have some time.               I will read some cases.    Which ones do you want me to read?                   And I don't need to read the standard.            I have the standard.           And I don't have to worry about -- I agree with the quotation of the statute; you have the burden.                     And the question is we have a record of those two pages, and does it clearly show that he abused his discretion when he said there was manifest necessity?              Now, I will read - whatever cases you tell me to read, I will read.                     But I want to find facts and I'm not sure you found some, either.              How could it be that there are no cases?    I mean really, thousands and thousands of mistrials?              How can it be that there are no cases?   Are reversals very, very rare for manifest necessity?              Oh, that's good.      Now, tell me then what did you find?           When you say "remotely as bad," then you perhaps found some where contention was rejected, or where contention -- what did you find? What did you find by way of cases where they said on facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there was no manifest necessity?
09-350 +++$+++        What is -- what is the answer to Justice Alito's question?     The -- a clerk doesn't give a license to someone he should.     Right? Now, you bring -- that person brings a lawsuit against the city. Now, if Monell applies, in order to win he has to show that it was the city's policy to deny it, or maybe all he has to show is the city's policy was to leave it up to the clerk.     And if he finds it was the city's policy to grant it, he's going to lose, which he should, because there was no such policy.     The clerk was wrong.       What's the harm in that? Now, the next question would be:     If we show the third, is there any ground for an injunction against the city?     And on that one, I don't know.     Maybe there is.     Maybe conditions changed.     I don't know. But what's the harm to anybody in doing - requiring that in order -- just what I said?     What's the harm?       There are two possibilities -- three possibilities.     The clerk denied the license. (A) there is a city policy which requires him to do it; (B) there is a city policy that permits him to do it; (C) there is a city policy that forbids him to do it.     All right? Now, those are the only three I can think of.     And it seems to me in (A) or (B), you could recover against the city, and in (C) you couldn't.       So -- so -- so, why -       If there's no city policy, then the city hasn't done anything wrong under Monell. Now, is that what you're arguing?     That the city should, even though it has no policy, nonetheless have to have attorneys' fees, is open to suit, et cetera, and forget about Monell?     Is that your argument?       If you're right about that -       All right.     If you're right about that, there's no problem for you because you are saying, yes, you need a city policy, and this counts as a policy.       -- against State.       I mean, here you have a statute, and the statute doesn't have any method in it to get off -- get out of it, even when you should. Their claim is this is a State matter, the State's responsible, it's unconstitutional, go sue the State and tell the State to do it. Now, that's a -- what's wrong with that position? And either they had the power to do it under State law or they didn't.     If they did have the power to do it, then you probably will show a practice.     If they didn't have the power to do it, why should they bear anything against them?     You should tell the State go do it.       What is wrong with that?       Why did the State -- why did they send it back?     I thought they sent it back in order to determine whether there was some policy against doing it.
09-367 +++$+++              Okay, now suppose -- now we re getting to exactly the point where I thought your co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what happens now in -- on day -- we re finished the trial.   The sentencing is over.               They got the presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he entered a judgment but didn't say anything about restitution, because he says:              I d like to give you a chance to appeal this.        And I'm not going to deal with restitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all within the 90 days. Can the defendant appeal that piece of paper?               The answer is because of this provision?               Whoa, whoa.      What about what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted, forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final judgment until all the parts that are there, and the restitution is part of it.            And so until it's final, you can't appeal it.    That's what -- that's what the case Parr, which it quoted.        What is -- what is your response to that?              Yes.              Well, I suppose it's no -- no imprisonment; it's supervised release.                  Now what happens?              Yes, but I mean, what's bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you re quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are very important. So unless I have in my own mind how -- how this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide this case.   I don't want to say something in here that s going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a criminal case. Now, what you ve told me is I'm supposed to say that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment, he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release, he doesn't, or I'm not sure.         Why not?         Yes, but if -- but I have to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have to respond to the argument of the other side, which is that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal.          Now, explain to me why that isn't so.             Which is just what you say he has to do if the sentence is supervised release.              Why don't we go back to my hypothetical --              -- and just substitute the word "fine" for "supervised release."              I'm not -- I'm not an expert in this area, as you can see.                     And -- and I need to have a place to go to look so that I can see that these things, in your view, all work out, and you re not creating some odd appellate system.                     Do you have any suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and look at that would help me?             Can the (o) -- you remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?             All right.        Can that be read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of restitution as well as an amended judgment?             Look, you straightened me out, from your point of view.              But now you've mixed me up again. (Laughter.)             Because I think you said that the defendant is just out of luck.                 But, previously, you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is immediately appealable and must be appealed within 14 days because of that 3582.             And then you said (o) applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an order of restitution is a final judgment.                So if (o) applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later, that restitution is made final and embodied in another judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be appealed. So if you re right about (o) applying, then the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of luck.   Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to be on your side in this question. (Laughter.)             I ve got to figure this out.
09-400 +++$+++        Why is this so complicated? I'm probably missing something.       But the thing -- but it doesn't help you, I don't think, if it isn't complicated.       Is the -- because of Burlington, we're only talking about a certain number of employees who could make an employer responsible.       Right.     So those are supervisory people, we'll call them.       All right.     Now, why don't we just stop there and just say we have a statute, the statute says that if -- if a bad motive was a motivating -- had to be a motivating factor, discriminatory -- a discriminatory motivating factor in the dismissal, then, unless you can prove an affirmative defense, you lose. Why do we have to have something special if one of these small group of employees happens to be the person who said the last words or happens to be somebody who told somebody who said the last words or happens to be somebody who told the somebody the something-or-other?     You're just looking for one thing. And there could be five zillion fact situations. So why something special?     Why did the Seventh Circuit say where it's not the guy who said the last words, you have to show, quote, "singular influence"?     Why singular influence?     Why not just what the statute says -       -- that it was -- that it led to the -- what she said, led to the discriminatory motive being a motivating factor, period, end of the matter.     No special "cat's paw" rule, no special anything rule.       Oh, no.     Of course, you have to show proximate cause.     You have to show cause. You always do.     I'm just saying, why have a special rule?     Why not have a special rule if somebody was on the second floor?     You wouldn't think of that.     So if you're not going to do it because the person's on the second floor, why do it because they happen to be somebody who told somebody, rather than somebody who was the person who was told?       Well, fine.     You're perfectly entitled to say that.     But what I don't see that you're entitled to say are the words that the Seventh Circuit used, which is:     You have to show jury that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of singular influence.       That doesn't just sound like it was a motivating cause.     That sounds like it was something really special.       Ah, okay.     So why don't we say:     Seventh Circuit, if that's your way of saying it is just a normal thing like cause, we accept that, but please don't use those words.     And because you might have used -- you might have used them meaning something else, we will send this back so we're certain that what you are doing is applying the same test to everything. In other words, was it a motivating factor?       All right.     Then your - that seems like a good resolution of this case to me. I don't know if it does to them. (Laughter.)       Well, then you can't agree with me, because my question was why would that be?     You have two people, A and B; they are both supervisors.     In the one case, B fires the employee because he's in the Army, and he says it:     Ha, ha, that's why I'm doing it. In the second case, he fires the employee because he thought the employee was -- in one of Justice Sotomayor's hypotheticals or anyone else, he fires him for a perfectly good reason, but A has lied about it. And the reason A lied about it was because she wanted to tell him a lie so B would fire the employee, and her reason is because he's in the Army. Those two situations -- the second seems to me one of 80 -- 80 million situations, fact-related, that could arise, and I don't know why we want a special standard for such a situation.     Why not just ask the overall question:     Was this action an action that was - in which the bad motive was a motivating factor?     Forget psychoanalysis of A; B is good enough; or vice versa. That was my question.       Because together they dismissed the employee.       One by supplying the false statement, the other by acting on it.       They are both agents. That's why I made them both Burlington people.     I wanted to get them in the group.     They both have the same Burlington status, so we get that issue out of it.     And together they fire this individual.     In the absence of either the one or the other, he wouldn't have been fired.       I feel I'm going to get nowhere pursuing this hypothetical further.     So I will drop it and say -       -- answer it as you wish or as you understand it.
09-448 +++$+++              Well, the judgment is, send it back.    That's what it says:             Send it back.       And the reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration says she s completely disabled, that she s entitled in the -- on the evidence shown.              There s no substantial evidence to the contrary.           But you, the company, want to take money from her instead of giving her the money. Now, I ve read the record.                  It doesn't support anything contrary to what I ve said.                    So now you send it back.     Now, what is that but a big victory for the other side?      Which then leaves the company to say:    They're right; pay them. Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of English -- if you re -- we re talking about partial success. Partial success, or not total defeat.                    That is the language from Ruckelshaus.            Not "total success."             You still get it.   Okay.     What in the English language can we read in a case or a statute that would say you shouldn't reach that commonsense result?                  Now, of course, I m characterizing it a little bit, but it does seem like a commonsense result.             If someone wants a remand, it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a holding of the district court.                The ERISA administrator was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give this woman nothing.       In my opinion, she's entitled at least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't know.     So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may allow a reasonable attorney's fee.                   Nothing more.   Now, what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation?             If that's what you think.              You distinguish between him saying you have to give her at least 30 and his saying the evidence that supports giving her less than 30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's the word?     Yes, worthless.              That's the line you draw?              That may be, but why can't they do this?    What would be wrong with this heretical idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out of the court, the district judge -- that group of people we were talking about -- has discretion to decide whether ultimately they got something significant of what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped them get them something significantly of what they wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up to the district judge as long as the district judge doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives him? What would -- I mean, would the Earth come to an end?   What would happen that would be so terrible if we said something like that?              It didn't say anything against the catalyst theory.             It said you have to remember this is an American country, we follow the American rule, and there has to be something special in the situation.    And what would be special in this situation is that the judge has to decide that as a result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did get something significantly of what she wanted.              You also received -- she also received a conditional judgment in her favor.              She said order goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment will be entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her.              Well, she got one judgment in her favor.   It was a conditional judgment.                 I mean, if we re being technical, if we re going to just do this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just don't want to look to the merits of it and see what really happened, then why doesn't she win?                  Because she got a judgment in her favor, okay?                 End of the matter.              Well, let's read the judgment.   Let's see.       It says -- it says judgment.            It says in a -- what is it called?                I just saw it here. My colleague had it here. It says -- I think this it.                   It says  Conclusion -- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and it says what happens.        And it says it denies, denies, denies, denies.   And then it says:                 "Reliance to act on Ms. Hardt's application, adequately considering all the evidence, within 30 days.           Otherwise, judgment will be issued in favor of Mrs. Hardt." Now, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess. It's in an order.     So an order saying we ll issue a judgment -- it sounds to me like you could say that's a judgment in her favor.        You don't have to, but you could.                No.    Normally, a judge -- a judge doesn't say:     It is ordered that if you do not act within 30 days, there will be a judgment entered in flavor of the plaintiff.          That's not a usual thing.             I'm just saying, if we re going to be formal and we re going to look to certain words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of what really happened, don't we have those words in the paper that's relevant here?
09-475 +++$+++  
09-479 +++$+++        So there are two possible readings now of the "except" clause where it says -- the words are this subsection doesn't apply where a mandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth a higher mandatory.     Now, one possible reading, which is yours, is what this means is that, judge, where you are operating under that provision you just mentioned, and you're going to -- the guy has committed two serious 924(c) things and so he is entitled to life -- this is just what the Chief Justice said -- this is done to remind the judge don't give him life plus 25 years, because it would be 25 years under this statute, not 5. That's one possible reading. The other possible reading is, judge, where, in fact, you have a pretty -- you have the underlying drug offense that's going to get you up into the 30s and it's -- you know, in the guidelines, it's going to be probably 10, 5 years, or whatever it is.     You have a pretty high drug offense already.     And now we give him 5 extra years, say, for having a gun under this, unless he's already gotten, say, a mandatory minimum of 7 years. And if he's already gotten the mandatory minimum of 7 years, here's what's happening:     Judge, turn to the guidelines, and the guidelines will tell you to add 3 or 4 extra years.     So in one -- that -- those are the two possible readings. Now, the first reading to me makes very little sense.     The second reading to me says, yes, this is serving a purpose.     It's once you're sure this guy has to go to jail for 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 or 20 years for sure, extra amounts are controlled by the guidelines, which is administered by a judge. Now, if you just came across that for the first time, which would you think was most probable.       When -- when did Congress pass the statute that they amended in 1998?     The one with -- you're saying -- I mean, it's a good point.     You have a point, that this would make it more lenient, the interpretation.     But the "it" was passed when?       So that's way before the guidelines.     So what they are trying to do now is the - in 1998, is they're trying to -- see, in 1998 what they're trying to do is take some of these old provisions and reconcile them with this new system that has come along.     So I agree you have a point there. But it -- it does make a certain amount of sense, because what it is saying is, in these cases where you have a whoppo mandatory minimum anyway, so you're sure he's got it; now, the additional amount will be controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to not much discretion.     They are pretty close to mandatory minimums, but there's a little wiggle room.       Oh, it's not strongly.     The -- what is it an example?     You're saying the other - this thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday Congress will pass a new statute, a totally different one, and a busy district judge might think that he should add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to whatever sentence this hypothetical new statute provides, but this will tell him not to do so.     Did you have anything in mind?       I take it in those other offenses there are other things in the code, and the odd thing about this one is there is no other thing in the code except the one we've been discussing.     And so I just wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody thinking of adding some new thing that this might have been applicable to?     Or have you come across anything? I take it your answer is no.       No, no, no.     It's a shift over to the sentencing guidelines, which say a person like this one will receive an extra 3 or 4 or 5 years depending on the circumstances.     Will receive it, just like a mandatory.     Unless, of course, it is an unusual case.     That's what it's a shift to.       Am I wrong?       I didn't say that -
09-497 +++$+++              What is -- what I'm not sure about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into this, I thought there were three situations.                  Situation 1 is common in labor arbitration.                  It's an arbitration agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question about whether a particular dispute is or is not full within the definition.             As to that one, we assume that the parties intended the question of arbitrability to be arbitrated; we assume it.               Normally, that's the rule.   It's the scope of the arbitration agreement. That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes that's not the argument.         The argument could be:             Well, there are four different provisions in the arbitration section, and we think one of them is void because it's, say, unconscionable, but the others are okay.                    Now, that one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough say I want that one to go to arbitration. And the third one is that you have a contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on four separate pieces of paper, and what you re saying is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe unconscionability is the equivalent.                    On that one I'm with you. I don't see how you can submit -- agree to submit that to the arbitrator, because there s no agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid one under State law. But what are you arguing?                   That this is that case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that middle case where you have 10 provisions and you re saying that this one over here is unconscionable but that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid arbitration agreement. I agree with that.                    It's just that certain provisions of it are invalid because they re unfair.   What are you arguing in this case?              Well, the second one -- I don't see how you get there, because if it's the second, one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement that s valid.    And if you concede that there is a valid arbitration agreement between you and your client, and you re arguing over the scope of different provisions or whether certain provisions within it are valid or invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if it s clear enough?              As to each provision?    As to each bit of -- why?              But suppose you and your -- your client -- rather, your client and the other side have absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the arbitration agreement:         We want arbitrated too whether the provision that these words are contained in is unconscionable.   Can't they agree to that?          Okay.      Let me say it more easily.   We have agreement number one, four pages, and within it is a question of -- which just looks like this one.   Agreement number two:        The two parties agree that if any dispute should arise as to whether any words in agreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to the arbitrator.   Agreement number two is concededly valid.    Now do you want to say that agreement number one -- those words have to be decided by the court?          Right, but if you re going to say yes --          -- then I think if you re going to say yes to that, then it s contrary to First Options, I think. I'm not sure, but I don't see why not.             And I am apparently the only one in the world --             -- the only one in the world who thinks that.        And I ll go back to --             Looking at your response to their motion to arbitrate --             -- it seemed to me you said here that -- that because of your -- your position, your client's position, that the whole thing is unconscionable.    You didn't say that?             Yes.             But not every contract.        I mean, I ll take that argument.              I d like to know about that argument.      I d like to know what really is the underlying, which I ve never looked up. What is the underlying rationale in contract law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable?                     Why do courts do it?   What's the theory?                   I d like to know that.             See, that's what I wonder, that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is is that we don't think that they really meant to do it?             Okay.       On that question, or any other question, is, I would imagine, where we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe agreement one was unconscionable.                And then we enter into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute in agreement one, and there s nothing wrong with agreement two, I would think that's then the question of unconscionability is for the arbitrator.             You said "all," and I just don't think you meant all.            But maybe you did.        That's why I asked the question.
09-520 +++$+++        Haven't you just pushed all the difficult questions into the word "generally applicable"?     I imagine a fuel tax applies to everybody in the State, but then we exempt everybody who does business in the State with fuel.       Except for railroads.       All right, now.     You want to call that not a generally applicable class?     Do you want to call it a discrimination against railroads?     It seems to me about the same question.       All right.     So why isn't the easiest thing to say, since there's so many other questions involved in discrimination:     Yes, the clause applies?     What counts is a discrimination is an obviously difficult question, and we will send it back for somebody else to wrestle with this, since it's so difficult.       What is the choice?       I realize that, but what they are worried about is somebody that's having passed on the property level -       -- thinks I have a great revenue-raising idea.     What we do is tax the New York Central, and then they sit down with a bunch of lawyers and the lawyers say:     Oh, great, they come through this State; what we'll do is we'll have a tax that applies to all fuel and then we will exempt everybody except the New York Central.     All right.     Great. We've now found a replacement of the revenue that they just said in Congress we couldn't have in the first three provisions.       No, because you're saying that's not generally applicable.     They are saying sure it is, read the first line, applies to everybody. You say no, no, no.     That's a trick because of the second line.     So now what we will do is we'll monkey around with it a little bit.     And we will make it tough. All I'm saying is that's precisely the same question in that context as whether it's discriminates or not.     I'm not saying it's an easy question.     I'm just saying it might be clearer if we said, yes, the thing applies, now go work out the hard question of whether you had have got a discriminatory tax.       The property taxes, the language is different.       You are assuming how the Court will decide the word "discriminate."       I understand what you are saying, and so would every other judge.     And of course, it's hard to figure out in these contexts what is real discrimination, but there could be obvious cases.     And so why cut out the obvious cases simply because it's hard in a non-obvious case to figure it out?       There is no way -- there is no way with the property -- the property tax is tough. And once you start taking exemptions into account, it's double tough, and there is very little need, is there? Every State in the country has property taxes and every State in the country has property taxes on businesses.       And -- and it might not be so that every State in the country has particular taxes on diesel fuel.     And it might be that they don't have taxes on rails, or it might be that they -- you see? So, I -- I -- that's how I am explaining to myself. What do you think?       No, but it's not quite, because this is the same problem I was raising.     You just shoved the difficult questions into generally applicable.     But you might think of some new ways of doing it that they don't want.     So I would worry about giving you just the decision where the word in the statute is "discriminate," and nowhere does it say "generally applicable."     I'd somewhat worry about whether this statute shoves the same problems into two words that aren't there as to rather leaving those problems for resolution under the one word that is there.       I'll believe you, I'll believe you. (Laughter.)       The word -- the word I was looking at was is 4, impose another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier providing transportation, subject to the jurisdiction of the board under this part.     Now, I read all the words of 4, and I found the word "discriminates," and I did not find the two words "generally applicable."       Yes, but in all these years where they never challenged it, did all these other States not only tax their diesel fuel, but at the same time exempt the diesel fuel tax from all their competitors.       What's the rationale, that the trucks don't have to say it but the railroads do?
09-5201 +++$+++                 But the trouble with that, and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment, because then -               -- we never considered it when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that time because the language was different. But now that you had have got this language now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year.                  He is sentenced for a year and a day, you see.                  So literally, it says calculated on January 2 of the next year.                  But he's already been in for longer than he should be by that point.     So you really have to calculate it before the year ends; you have to calculate it at least by October. And -- and -- and once you start calculating it before, the statute literally says, we are into a more complicated thing than I thought.             That's true.        But the strongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in his mouth because this is complicated.                   But I see it as this.   Let's call that time you are talking about, that tenth year, phantom time.             Now, you are saying don't put in any phantom time.          And he's saying let's put some in. Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I think, for his is the following -- think about that first year.    That first year we are going to calculate 54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to the number 311, right? But if you were to apply the last sentence to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't get 54.     You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something like that.     But everybody agrees under the Bureau of Prisons system that it is 54.               And, therefore, in respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a sentence to a year and a day.               If you had a sentence to a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody agrees with that, and that includes phantom time. So he said, well, if you include it for the first year, since the statute says nothing about the first year, why not include it for the other years, too? How can you possibly justify phantom time being included in the first year but not in the other years?             So, in other words, they don't let him out under 311?              In other words, the Bureau of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the last sentence in the prorating of that sentence?              Is that -- is that what happens?
09-525 +++$+++        What is it that -- I'm unclear on this.     That's why I use the oil company example.     Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the oil company write the false statement.     They give it to a board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts it out in its name. Now, it seems to me it ought to be clear at this point in securities law whether those -- the president and vice president are or are not liable under this 10-b, the (B) part.       And they are liable.       You're saying they are liable?       All right.     Then their response to that is:     This is not like the president of the oil company, and the reason that it's not is something to do with the nature of the -- the obligation that runs between the managers and the fund, which is somehow different between -- you understand it better than I. Can you say what it is and what you think your response is?       All right.     So you're saying -- you're saying it shouldn't matter that if they issued -- it's worse if they run the whole company than if they're just the president?       All right.     Now, at that point, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do we distinguish an aider or abettor from a principal?       At that point, I am uncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for comment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law here and say at least they're a principal if they have a high position, they participate in it, they do all these things you say, and the entity that they're fooling in the first instance is simply a conduit, and, therefore, you cannot say it's a scheme, because this other part of the scheme wasn't part of it.       Yes.       Yes.       What's the difference between substantial assistance and -- and doing it?       There's a distinction.     You want to say what the distinction is.     So I would - consistent with the view there is no aiding and abetting liability, you still would win your case.       He may just be some poor associate, his first day at work.     The law firm sent him over there, and there he got stuck down in the boiler room.     And somebody said why don't you write something that will get everybody to sell things, and -- and why don't you say we're a thousand tons of oil instead of only a ton?     There he is.     He writes it out.     You think he's liable?       No, no, he knows.     He knows.       At some level he knows shouldn't be saying they found a thousand tons of oil when they only found 50.     Okay?     And four people told him to go do something like that, but he's the guy who wrote it.     I'd say he didn't behave well, but I don't think he's the principal.       They didn't say what words to write.       They gave him the general idea, and then he did it.     He created the words, to use your phrase.     When you say "creating the words," he's a great writer.       Ah, now we have "sufficiently involved."     Once we're into sufficiently involved, we're back into what is sufficient to make the person the principal rather than the aider and the abettor, and apparently creating or writing the statement is not clear whether it is or is not sufficient.     So we're back into the problem.       I'm interested in your test. I'm interested in your test, not the -
09-529 +++$+++        Nothing pleases them more than to have everybody suing everybody else.     So they pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in this State, every department can sue every other department. Now, if you have such a State, what in the Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules, looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then, if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing another, say, well, if it complies with those first set, the fact that A sues B and they're both State agencies, that's the State's decision.     What in the Constitution can prevent the State from deciding to organize what we'll call the legal heaven way? (Laughter.)       Okay.     That's A.     We can go into A later because I agree that would be an answer, if it's correct -- I mean, if that is what happened. That's a different question, whether Congress could restructure the State.     That's a serious question.     But my question was on the first.     Can Congress stop the State from restructuring itself?       If they wrote it down specifically in the law and said we'd love to have our agencies sue each other.     They don't say Federal court. They just say we love to have our agencies sue each other.     They don't mention the court.       Why?     What's undignified about allowing the State -       -- to live with the choice it made?       No.     The hypothetical was just -- Justice Sotomayor is totally right.     I'm talking about Ex parte Young.       I'm imagining -- I'm imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG, this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the City of San Francisco -- they want to permit such entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte Young requirements are met.     What in the Constitution of the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?       It isn't that Ex parte Young, if I understand this right, which is why I mention it -- it isn't that Ex parte Young permits one part of a State to sue another part; it is a State permits one part of a State to sue another part, that that's common in the State, that the law requires it. And the question is, in that circumstance, should the Ex parte Young situation be treated differently?       Am I right about the statement of the question in the case?       In your experience -- this would be helpful -- would you characterize as common or uncommon situations where State agencies are given authority to sue other parts of the State?     As I think it to myself, I think, well, City of Glendale v. State Water Authority, or Middlesex County Sheriff v. The Bureau of Prisons.     That doesn't sound weird to me.     It sounds as if there probably are a lot of such circumstances, but I don't know.     What -- what do you think?       Cities -- cities against - they must do that a lot.       University of Massachusetts v. State Environmental Organization.     Does that -- does that kind of suit sound familiar to you or -- or not?       Right.     Now, explain - this is good because that's very helpful to me -- the exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said yes, that's exactly right. And then it is the case that a citizen of the State could come into Federal court and sue the State official under Ex parte Young, but you say -- but the agency of the State can't do it, even though they have State litigating authority.     And the reason that the latter is more injurious of the dignity interests of the State than the former is -
09-530 +++$+++        So what is your view of what the liberty -- you're saying that the words in the Constitution that protect the right that you claim was violated are the words, "No person shall be" -- I guess -- "deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."     I guess you mean the word "liberty."       All right.     And in your words, it is liberty -- define it.     Liberty to what?       There is a right to liberty to control information about oneself?       All right.     And all information?     Some information?       Liberty -- there's a liberty to control all information?     Protected from -- from what?     From the state?     The state doesn't have a right to give you any -- get any information about you? On a driver's license?     It's -- what?     When does it come into play?       So the fact that the government says -- I go and I want my driver's license, and they say fill out the form, we want to see how you -- if you can drive or not, that potentially could violate the Constitution?       Potentially.     It might not, because it might be justified, but each such case would have to be justified.     Is that -- is that your theory?       It says "liberty."     The liberty, you said, was liberty to control information about yourself.       So I want to know how that works.     Every time anyone in the Government asks a question about you personally -- of course, it wouldn't be unconstitutional -- but every time it would have to be a justified thing; is that -- is that your theory? I'm just asking.       And so, what -- how do we decide?     I'm a little interested, if you could spend 2 or 3 minutes elaborating this. A number of laws, Federal laws -- I imagine the regulations fill this room, and I think many -- maybe more, maybe several rooms.     And many of them involve asking people for information.     And the number of forms that ask people for information, I guess, about themselves, might fill several rooms.     And I can imagine in a country of 300 million people, you would find someone objecting to many of the questions. And so, how is the system supposed to work, in your view, where judges will decide whether a particular question -- I'm not saying you're wrong.     I just wanted to get an idea from you as to how this legal system works, where any question asked by the Government about a person is potentially subject to challenge as unconstitutional.     You and I will agree that many are fine.     But you are worried about some that aren't fine. How does it work, the system, distinguishing the ones from the other?       That's the kind of thing that you might want to know, and despite the ambiguity there, and it seemed to me that question 7 sort of drove at that.     And so -- but they did enjoin it.     So, in your view, is that aspect of the injunction wrong?       All right, then, if it's right, why is it right?     Because it seems to me the basic thing any employer would want to know is whether I'm lucky to get this person to work for me, that kind of thing.       I mean, what is the specific thing about question 7 that you think is unlawful or should be changed?     What words do you object to in that question?       All right.     So they cannot ask, do you have any information about this person's employment, residence, or activities concerning general behavior or conduct or other matters?     Now, I am an employer and I'd like to find out if he's going to do a good job.     So what am I supposed to say?     There doesn't seem to be a place here other than that to get into that question.       I see.     I see.
09-5327 +++$+++           You mean to imply that earthquake, fire, flood, mad postman burns mail truck, et cetera?          So, even if it's a terrible earthquake, all these people are just out of luck?          Well, why?     Natural disaster, yes, you said no equitable tolling, they re out of luck?          The statute?          And, so, are you -- you read the statute to say in some cases, you could do it. If you re going to read it in some cases you can do it, then I guess we re at a discussion of is this one of those cases?          So that s earthquake, fire, flood, et cetera?          Well, why should it matter? It's certainly unusual.       Isn't that what we are after, one, is he diligent?     Answer, yes, he has been diligent. Two, is it extraordinary?           I would think it was fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters to counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't filed.     Is that extraordinary or not? Whether it was his fault, whether he himself was kidnapped.     I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's fault.     You can imagine a lot of circumstances.           But the question, I would think, is, is it extraordinary and is it fair?          You mean counsel in Florida often when -- miss deadlines and so forth when their counsel -- when their client specifically says to them, even a few weeks before and by mail several times, please file such-and-such, is not extraordinary in Florida?          We have a problem with the bar, don't we, if -- if -- if the -- if -- (Laughter.)          Why could you not say here -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the Eleventh Circuit and it says:            No allegation of lawyer negligence or failure to meet the standard of care  -- none -- without  proof, bad faith, dishonesty, mental impairment  on the part of the lawyer, could ever qualify. Now, that's -- so we just say, no, no, that isn't so.   Sometimes it could, when combined with other circumstances.   And then go back and let them -- I don't know what this particular individual Petitioner's prior conduct has been.    I understand the problems that you have.   But do you -- I guess you re going to say no to this, but -- but it's a little hard to see why you couldn't have a narrow standard but just not rule out the possibility that under certain circumstances, just negligence or even less -- maybe the lawyer wasn't even at fault; maybe he got kidnapped.           You know, I mean, there are odd things that happen in life.            And just say go look for this; see if it's truly extraordinary, if it's fair, if he was diligent.    What about that?            So would there be -- I mean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer being kidnapped.     I'm actually worried what can happen in a person s life.          He gets deathly ill.    His wife gets sick.   Something happens to the children.            Some very unusual thing comes along at the last minute, and all the plans go awry.     And to have a little bit of flexibility in this statute to take care of those very unusual human circumstances seems a reasonable reading of it.            But you say it's not because --
09-559 +++$+++                 Suppose that in 1957 in Little Rock, a group of Little Rock citizens had wanted to put on the ballot a petition to require the school board to reopen Central High School, which had been closed because there was a sentiment in the community that they didn't want integration.                   And it was pointed out that if they signed this petition, there was a very good chance that their businesses would be bombed, that they would certainly be boycotted, that their children might be harassed. Now, is there no First Amendment right in protecting those people?           And if there is, how does it differ from your case?
09-571 +++$+++        Isn't -- am I right -- am I right on this?     Here -- I read on page 4 of your brief that it seemed what happened -- and I might not be right.     Correct me if I'm not.     What happened is a piece of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the prosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what it said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was type B.     And the person on trial has blood of type O. Is that what happened?       And the -- and the prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?       Ah, that's something --       I see.       Did it turn out at the trial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?       When the did they learn that?
09-5801 +++$+++        I understand that, but what you are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender discrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender discrimination.     Now, is there any reason to do that? I think that was the thrust of the question.       All right.     Now fine.       If it's the government's position you do, does the same thing apply to racial discrimination?     Do you also apply a lesser standard to racial discrimination?       This is suddenly is cutting a big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.       You have -- we have the briefs that are filled with, you know, pros and cons about the statelessness business and whether it was real, and I've read those and I would like your comment on those, but I want to comment, too, on this very - what may be a very minor thing, but I did notice, prodded by an article, I have to say, that -- that for the women there is a sense in which its tougher -       -- and that's because of the continuous period. Now, I guess it depends on how that is enforced, but there could be a class of people, say, living in the border, near Canada or near Mexico where they step across the border on Christmas day to say hello to my cousin, and -- and does that stop them from taking advantage of that?     Is it -- in other words, how is this enforced?     Is it enforced with that rigidity?       Which means that you can't stop with across the border?     You can't -       Is there -- is there - well, is there or isn't there, to your knowledge?     Is this enforced with total rigidity or is it enforced that maybe you could go once a month or you could go on your birthday, or what is the answer?       In that situation you cannot go across the border?       All right.     So, if it's tough then and really is meant to be tough, then there is a -- what is the rationale for treating women in this respect worse than treating men?       The 1 year, I grant you, the time 1 year is treating them better than the time 5 years.     But the word "continuous," it's really tough is what your answer leads me to believe, and they really mean it.     I mean, then that's treating them worse than treating the men.     And I would like to know what is the rationale for treating them worse?       Is there -- is there anything that rings a bell in this in your mind, of -- I mean, the thing that goes the other way is the right of an American citizen to pass his American citizenship on to his children.     And when we talk about -- when we talk about Congress's power over naturalization, is there anything that's drawn a distinction between the general power, which are people who are not citizens to become citizens, but what it seems to me intuitively is a different situation, of the right to pass your citizenship on?     Does that ring any bell at all?       I'm not saying there is such a right.     I just wonder if it rings any bell at all that this has ever been discussed in anything you've come across.       All right.     Just looking - in trying to get your memory -- well, does something come to mind the opposite way that -- where the Court did go into a long exegesis about the law, including constitutional law, and then says at the end, well, but you are not entitled to memory -- to a remedy because of some other -
09-587 +++$+++        But what they cite it for, actually, is they make a slightly different argument in their brief.     They say going back to 1974, there are at least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal issue and deny it on the merits. Now, not in your case, but in most cases that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the question of whether there's an adequate and independent State ground of a procedural nature.     So, what they're saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which it had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do it. So, that, I think, is a fairly strong argument.     Now, you're going to -- the only reason that you're not out of court on your own interpretation is because you'll say that the State waived the procedural issue.     And then they'll come back and say so did you. So, what -- what is your response to all that?       Well, look, for example, in Hunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the following:     The California Supreme Court's denial of a State habeas petition, quote, "without comment or citation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the Federal claims."     End quote.     And then they have three other cases roughly to the same effect. Now, what you're saying is that this Court should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that there is an adequate and independent State ground in case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature. But, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme Court is significant, I think, when faced with those pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means by the Ninth Circuit.
09-60 +++$+++           The exact words of Lopez, which I think are important:                "We hold that a State offense constitutes a felony punishable under Controlled Substance  & only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony."        Okay?          Under Federal law.          Now, there s an ambiguity when you use a word like "offense" or "crime."     Sometimes you mean what this guy did, and sometimes you're referring to a statute.                 It's statutes that proscribe, not what this guy did.                 So we re talking about the statute.         So what it tells us to do -- and we said the same thing in Nijhawan, and I have written in other opinions the same thing -- you go read the State statute.   Forget what he's done.           Read the statute and see if the statute proscribes conduct that would amount to a felony under Federal law. So let us read the statute.            We turn to the statute of conviction.      What it says is it is a class A misdemeanor for which you are punishable of less than a year if you possess less than 28 grams or whatever.               It says nothing about recidivism.           There is no increased punishment for recidivism. So all we did was read the statute.             The statute does not proscribe conduct that would be a felony under Federal law; it proscribes conduct that would be a misdemeanor.      QED.        This person has not been punished in Texas under a statute that proscribes conduct that would be a felony under Federal law.             End of case. Now, what is the matter with what I just said?            What do you mean,  a two-step inquiry ?            Okay.        Okay.            No --            Where does it say that?   Where does it say that in the language? You are looking to the conduct that the statute proscribes, not what he engaged in.                Suppose the State statute says it is a misdemeanor to steal a chicken, okay?          It is called -- it is written right here in this case.             It is written in Nijhawan.   What is it that tells us to go beyond the conduct that the State statute proscribes, not some other thing?          Where is the additional question?   Read me the words of the statute that -- there might be.     I'm not -- I'm being argumentative, but I want to know what words in the statute say there -- or what words in a case say go look to some other thing beyond what the State statute proscribes?          Yes.     What offense?     The offense proscribed --          -- by State law.        That's why I asked you:     Where does the State statute proscribe something that has to do with recidivism?                 I ve read that State statute three or four times.            You go ahead.          It is absolutely established that this person in breaking into that house at night only wanted to steal a pop gun, and he is the least likely to cause harm in the world. Question:     He is convicted of burglary.       Is that a crime of violence?        Answer?          Correct.          The answer is of course, because we are not looking to whether he is the pussycat burglar or the cat burglar.          We are to look to the statute of conviction and see what it is that that behavior forbids -- the statute forbids.             Lewis, Nijhawan say -- do precisely the same thing with this part of that long list.    Indeed, Nijhawan lists this provision as an example of what you would do the same thing for. Now I'm back to my first question.              Let's do it.   Read the Texas statute.            And where in that Texas statute does it say a word about recidivism or punish that conduct? Now, if I adopt your position, am I not, not simply overturning Lewis and Nijhawan, but getting a very mixed up area of the law which we have tried to straighten out -- Taylor, ACCA -- once again totally mixed up.    That's my concern.          That's what was worrying me, that's why I asked the other question.          But the -- what was worrying me would be a statute where they -- it's big enough in the State to cover possession with recidivism or not, and they deal with it at the punishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to that.    But that isn't this statute. This statute not only doesn't deal with it at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into account because what this says is you can only get recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make it.   That's why I m back to the cat burglar.          It did?      Well, Nijhawan uses this provision as an example of where it didn't.
09-6338 +++$+++            Can -- can I ask you a different question on the secondary argument that they make?   When I read the secondary argument, that there was an error in the calculation of the guidelines and she would like to have that error corrected, I didn't see anything in the policy statement that would prevent her from getting that correction.           But why?           What in the policy statement?   Because what it says is:             What you're supposed to do is:   Judge, you go and look at the guidelines that were applied.            Now, substitute the new one reducing the sentence for the old one, and then go apply it. And, therefore, that seems to me not to block a claim that would say, when you apply these guidelines with the new one substituted for the old one, apply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error the first time. Now, she may have a hard time showing that, but if she can show it, what in the words that are right there in (b)(1) stops her from getting that correction?        I have it.        I have it in front of me.        That s right.        That s right.        Well, all other guideline application decisions, and the claim is that they just made an error, like a clerical error, a clear error, manifest injustice, in that first math.           Do you think that this would leave them unaffected?        Yes.     I see.            No, no.      I would have thought the objection to that is:        No, they didn't make a mistake in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker isn't retroactive.            And, of course, they did make a mistake if it is retroactive.            And then the Court should have said it is retroactive, in which case there would be no problem.          I know my word was shall leave all other guideline application decisions. Well, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the guideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong guideline or they didn't apply the right words.             You see, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied the wrong thing.     Now you say I'm working too hard. Okay.
09-658 +++$+++        Might.     See, that's the trouble.     We have a lot of evidence, I think, here, at least by first glance, that -- a lot of evidence he shot the guy.     A lot of evidence he carried -- kidnapped him. All right?     And now the -- now, maybe it was accidental, but if it was accidental, it's still felony murder; and he received through the plea bargaining the minimum sentence he could get for that. You started out by saying that the -- the State court's conclusion that this was not prejudicial was clearly wrong.     All right.     If it's clearly wrong, what is it so clear, that he could get off if he went to trial?       There is no -- there is no State court finding that this was not prejudicial?       I'm not talking about Hill. I don't know the names of the cases associated.     I thought that the court in the State court said -- but I might be wrong; I'd like to know -- made a finding that one, this was not ineffective assistance of counsel and two, it was not prejudicial.       Now I haven't read this very thoroughly, so -- so you -- yet -- so you tell me if I'm wrong about that.       Doesn't Strickland require that it be prejudicial?       If I assume that the word "fruitless" and the reference to Strickland were a finding, that this is not prejudicial -- if I assume that for the sake of argument for the moment, what is it that you can show that shows it was prejudicial?       That was the same question I think Justice -- Justice Sotomayor started with.       Okay.     I've got on the other -- I've got -- the other reason I asked the question, to be clear about it, is that -- is that he wouldn't have gone to trial in my mind unless he had a pretty good chance of getting a better deal.     And what he -- like getting off.     And what he got was the minimum.     Okay? One thing I've written down is that the State would not have the confession.     That's correct. Number two is he could say his brother is not a very good brother.     Moreover he's a rather dubious character there, and bring all that -- stuff.     Was there anything else?       I don't want to miss anything.       That is an irrelevant question.     I don't see how we could go back to a possibly irrational state of mind.     I mean, don't - when you're trying to figure out what a defendant would have done in the absence of an error in respect to a plea, don't you have to ask a question:     What would a rational person have done. I mean, I would say that's a good question. I don't know the answer, but if we are trying to figure out he might have been totally irrational and would have gone to trial even though he was likely to end up in jail for life as opposed to 25 years, we should then reverse it and give him a trial?     I'm rather disturbed by that.       What do you actually think about this?       They believe it.     The jury believes it was an accident.     Now, how does that get him a lighter sentence?       No.     The sentence is 25 years mandatory for felony murder.     Now, the jury believes just as you said.     It believes it was an accident; he never intended to pull the trigger. How does that get him a lighter sentence? That's my question.       Isn't kidnapping a felony?       Well, then, if he is kidnapped -- if he is convicted of the kidnapping and there was an accidental murder that took place, I believe that that would be felony murder.       Yes.     And the defense to kidnapping was what?
09-6822 +++$+++        But all those -- what you'd tend to do is take the parts that refer to the other statute and say they don't do anything.     And does that ruin the provision it's in?     The answer, I think, normally ws no, it doesn't ruin it at all.     It makes sense. But this one is a tough one.     I grant you that this one is a tough one.     And my problem of course is I can think of a constitutional way of applying this, but it's a little far-fetched.     And the far-fetched one makes me think that it's unconstitutional in the far-fetched nature of it, and I don't think it has a spillover.       You see, the far-fetched one was the one that was brought out.     I mean, not far-fetched.     To -- to say in those circumstances that it is constitutional, where they're going to apply a new guideline and they don't have the evidence -- as much as I dissented in Apprendi, I think that one probably does violate Apprendi.       And I think I have to stick up for that, don't I?       They can check a box.     They can check a box and the -- unless they're going to depart.     Now, the part that's not necessary -- you could deal with later, but the part that's confusing me is where this word "variance" comes into, because I think the word "departure" would normally -- normally -- cover the matter.     And then when it gets to the court of appeals, the court of appeals, whether they're inside the guideline or outside the guideline and have departed, reviews the matter for -- you know, inside and have departed or outside, those situations.     It says in Booker the standard is to review for reasonableness. But where does this variance business come in?       But the problem, to be very specific, is I think the following:     The first sentencing, the judge applies the guideline.     He says: There was $300,000 stolen from the bank.     I look it up over here and I get sentence X.     On appeal, the appellate court says:     You should have counted the securities as money taken.     So it's 1,300,000.     So go and apply guideline Y.     He goes back, looks at Y -- it's a very high number -- and thinks:     Given certain circumstances which make this case unusual, I want to depart downward. Now, I would have thought that the judge's behavior in that second instance would have violated Apprendi, because that judge was either going to sentence even without the departure on the basis of his having taken some securities worth a million dollars which was not a fact that went to the jury.     So there it is.     Or he'd have to throw aside the guideline. But this statute says you can't throw aside the guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that wasn't previously given.     So this statute is -- is forcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was not found by a jury.     I think that's the argument for saying it violates Apprendi.     And I -- I don't see why it doesn't.
09-737 +++$+++        But surely it has to be raised post-trial if your legal argument is:     Look at the facts; the facts of this case as proved do not support liability. I mean, I would have thought that was a classic instance where you do have to make the motion. That's the whole point of having to renew it.       Am I wrong?       Why not?       I mean, do you normally - forget this case.     What the lawyer says is:     Judge, they are never going to be able to prove that my client crossed the intersection.     Okay?     We go to trial.     At trial, he wants to say:     We've heard all the evidence now, and it doesn't show my client crossed the intersection, so not liable.     Okay? Doesn't he have to renew it?       Yes.       Okay.     Fine.       Now, how is yours one bit different?     Because what you're saying is that the evidence, when you look at it, will show the facts are such that there must have been qualified immunity under the law.       Okay.     When you go back - you're the one who has read these cases pretty thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right. What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence. And 50(a) involves we're saying it won't be sufficient. And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient.     Then you could have the Chief Justice's rule.     It would work perfectly. But apparently there's a Second Circuit case, and some things in the treatises, that says sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other purpose.     And that's what seems to be going wrong.     Like if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing. You know, a question like:     Was there collateral estoppel that means that he couldn't say he was a policeman because they litigated this 4 months ago? That's a pure question of law. So, what are these cases and that exception in the treatise about?     What are they thinking of?     What kinds of instances do they think come under 50(a) that aren't sufficiency of the evidence?       Okay.     Suppose we could say this:     That when a lawyer uses 50(a) to make the kind of motion that does not involve sufficiency of the evidence but rather, in fact, could be made without 50(a), under those circumstances, he doesn't have to say 50(b).     How would that work?       Well, I don't know it would work fine, because it seems to me you have a lot of sufficiency of the evidence thing, but that's another question.       They're not -       Your case, anyway, is a case, judging from what they wrote, which -- I'm back to where I started -- the mixed questions and the fact-based questions are you really have to renew your motion.     And reading your opinion, it seems to me it's filled with determinations of fact.     They're reviewing what the jury did and could have found, and on the basis of what they could have found, they say you're not entitled to -- or you are entitled to qualified immunity. So this would seem like a hornbook case where you have to make the motion, and if you have to make the motion, you didn't; and if you didn't, you don't go back and review the facts as the motion on the basis of the facts as they were before the trial.     End of matter.     What's wrong with that?       No, no.     I mean they went on the jury's resolution of the facts.       For that reason, they can't take the facts as they were in your motion for summary judgment.     They have to take them on the basis of - they can't just go back and review them on the -- yes.
09-751 +++$+++        We are still worried about the statements on television and on the Internet and the knowledge there.     And I'm not -- I'm starting -- I'm trying to get the same answer from you I was trying from your colleague. Brandeis said that the right to be let alone is the most important, and so he must have been thinking there could be a tort there for interference with privacy, and the First Amendment doesn't stop State tort laws in appropriate circumstances.       And emotional injury, deliberately inflicted, could be one.     All right. Now -- and I think it is one.     But I see that in some instances that could be abused to prevent somebody from getting out a public message, and, therefore, I'm looking for a line. Now, let me suggest a couple.     See what you think.     Maybe you can think of some others. You could have a judge make the decision, since the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and the judge could say whether in this instance it was reasonable for the defendant to think that it was important to interfere with the emotional life of that individual. You could say if that was so, there will still be no -- there would be no punitive damages. There could be ordinary damages. You could remove all protection from the defendant in an instance where the defendant nonetheless knew, actually knew, that they were going to cause an individual who's private severe injury, emotional injury, irrespective of their public message. So what I'm doing is suggesting a number of thoughts of ways of trying to do what I'm trying to accomplish, to allow this tort to exist --       -- but not allow the existence of it to interfere with an important public message where that is a reasonable thing to do. Now, maybe this is impossible, this task. But I'd like your thoughts on it.
09-804 +++$+++        Okay.     Are you finished with that?       If you're finished.     As I understand what you have been saying and written, you don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract? I mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it according to terms.     That's one view. But if you took that view, you get into problems such as were mentioned.     The employer would write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable contract.     Nobody would understand it.     You'd have to worry about the time when it was less favorable than the written document.     So call it a plan if you want, as long as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract. Now, there's a provision that deals with it, saying just what you said in response to Justice Alito. And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that provision govern?     I take it there's a provision, 1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant. So I would have thought, I read that, I get what you've said in your brief.     The summary was inadequate.     It wouldn't have been understood, and, therefore, according to this particular provision, those provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void. So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of those particular void provisions, and you get what you want.     Now, I thought that makes a lot of sense to me, except I don't see that anywhere in this case.       So there's some reason it doesn't seem to appear in the opinions.     It doesn't appear in the briefs.     It doesn't appear anywhere until you just mentioned it in response to Justice Alito, or seemed to.       It is?       (h).     He's right, it's (h).       I understand that.     So suppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the logical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay?     Then we only have two choices.     The first choice is (1)(b), which seems to -- you want to use that by treating the summary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case we're under equity. Now, between those two, the first one gets all the problems that we just were talking about.     The second one would seem to be you're free and clear as long as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and then we're back to what I thought we granted this for, which is why not say if harm is likely, then the burden shifts?       What happens in a trust law where, let's say, there are 10 or 50,000 beneficiaries in a trust, and -- and the trustee has indeed made an error.     And now they can recover money only if, only if there really has been harm.     Now, how do the -- how does trust law work that out?     This can't be the first time this ever arose in history.     We have a big class, and -       Could they here have gone -- could they also have said to the company:     Look, why are you doing this?     If interest rates fall, we're going to lose money.     But interest rates might rise, and if interest rates rise, you'll lose money.     So we're risk-averse, so what we would like to do is just make sure we get the same pension that we would under Plan A, and then if there's more on Plan B, add it in, and we'll risk the fact that interest rates might have gone up.       So they could -- they might have talked the company into it.       But the SPD is written by the fiduciary.       And the other is written by the -- by the person who is giving the money, the employer.     So now you're saying that it's a contract, even though it wasn't written by the employer and even though it could differ in dozens of ways from the actual -- from the actual plan document.     Sometimes they'd be favorable to the employee, sometimes they'd be unfavorable, sometimes they'd be different but neutral. So what's the judge supposed to do?     Forget about the basic document and just enforce this thing written by the fiduciary?       Well, I said that there can be conflicts, sometimes favorable to the employee, sometimes unfavorable, sometimes neutral.     So what we have is a document that's, by the way, supposed to be short, but I guess if we took your view it wouldn't be short anymore.     And -- and it -- it could differ in any one of three ways; and I could think of seven other ways. So -- and we'll find seven others.     So, what -- how is a judge supposed to react?     Is he supposed to say that this two-page document is the contract, is the contract, and there are all kinds of conflicts -- what's supposed to happen?       That isn't my question.     My question is:     One, why should a document written by a different person, the fiduciary, govern over the actual plan?     Second, what happens when you have a favorable conflict?     What happens when you have an unfavorable conflict?     What happens when you have a neutral conflict?       How should it be worked out?       I think the fact that this individual in this case happened to be the same group or person is beside the point of my question.       Is that true of the certificate of insurance?     Is a certificate of insurance a simple document that any consumer is able to understand or -- or is supposed to be?       Is there an example I could look at?     Find one, on line -       Does it control when it's less favorable?       Oh.     It only controls when it's more favorable, but not when it's less favorable.       What theory of contract law gets you to that conclusion?
09-834 +++$+++        What about Justice Ginsburg's question?       What about her question? In 1938 a lot of illiterate people couldn't have filed written complaints.       Well, if they did, isn't it reasonable to think that they would have included in filing, in such circumstances, oral filing?       No, that -- your problem is -- that in front of us, do we have to decide that now?     We've granted a different question, etc.     So -       You may not want to give up your first point.       Right.     Then it's odd that you say -- it -- I gather, as well, for about 50 or 60 years the relevant agencies have interpreted the - the statute the way that -- to include oral complaints. And that seems to me a fairly strong reason for continuing to do so, if -- where the language is so -- allows it and there aren't any strong reasons the other way.       Maybe it's 30 years.     Maybe it's 30.       Well, Chevron deference would depend on an intent.     I guess you are getting into an argument here that there's no reason to repeat in public.     I mean, Justice Scalia and I don't necessarily agree on this.     Why would you -       Why?       How do we know?     I mean, all right, if you want to get into it, this is a very minor sort of interstitial point in a statute that they administer, and there are lots of instances, I think where the Court has said, where these minor matters of how you work out the actual application of the word are implicitly delegate it to the agency to determine within the context of reasonable view.       But not everything has to be done through formal rules.     There -- there are many, many ways of agencies determining practice.       Why?     Why would it be different?     If an agency work out a system of deciding when a person is really making a complaint, as opposed to an offhand remark, and that is good enough to run the government of the United States, where they have - where they are in this business, why -- why couldn't whatever their indicia are there, also be transplanted to the private sector -       -- and get that to work out all right -       -- in which case you would be left, if you are going to say that might work, then -- the you are left with the simple argument that you don't think that this statute means to apply to complaints to an employer, written or oral?       Would you accept -- you think -- that a tenable interpretation?     What this means is that written complaints are good enough to count as filings where you complained to your private employer, but written or oral count as a filing where you deal to -- with the government agency?       No, it isn't.       Yes, I agree with you.       On the ground itself, is there anything in the legislative history of the statute that says it's limited to the government?       That could be.     It could be that they are thinking of malicious complaints and they are thinking of government agencies at the time, but neither their language nor their purpose, as history later shows, requires that limitation on scope.
09-837 +++$+++ 
09-846 +++$+++        The main thrust that I was raising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble? They have to forego one kind of relief for another.     So what about injunctive relief, that's what he thought of, and Justice Scalia raises the point, well, they are not going to be entitled to injunctive relief anyway because the APA doesn't provide it, if I understand that correctly.     So you are giving up the null set.     You were giving up the null set.       But it couldn't get that?       It couldn't get that kind of relief in the Court of Claims?       Yes, it could.       What I'm trying to work out still in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe: You have to go to the court of claims, period.     Period. You can't go to these other courts, I mean unless you give up the court of claims.     Is the Indian Tribe going to really lose something it needs?       And, what I want to ask you about -       -- is in section 2 -       -- of 1491 there is a sentence which says, about the court of claims, in any case including the 1505 Tucker Act, the court shall have the power to remand appropriate matters to any administrative or executive body or official with such direction as it is may deem proper and just. Now that seems awfully broad, so I'm thinking now, if they want money, they can get the money from the court of claims.     If they want something like an injunction, they could ask the court of claims, tell the executive branch to behave the way we think they have to under the law and there's your authority.       I'm just quoting.     Now what's -- I want to know the response.       Well, you want money; that causes the problem.     If you don't want any money, you don't have a problem.     You Just forget about it.       Yes.       I had under the impression that sometimes they sued for some money out of a fund, which would have been partial, and other times they sued for the value of the cotton, and other times they sued for the cotton itself, which in certain circumstances could have been worth a lot more.     By the time of suit, it went up.     I mean, do we know it was always duplicative in those cotton suits?       Well, if the amount differs, then, why do you suppose the cotton belonged to the Indian Tribe?     On the one hand, they want an accounting out of the money ever earned out of this cotton in the past and on the other hand, they want what the cotton is worth in the future on the -       That's Justice Scalia's question.
09-868 +++$+++        Can you explain -       Can you go back for a second?     Imagine a defendant is convicted of robbery and he's sentenced to 10 years.     He thinks there is an error in my conviction of a legal nature, and he thinks there is another error in my -- in my sentence of a legal nature.     Now, I take it in Rhode Island he files an appeal to consider the first.       And as to the second, he files a Rule 35 motion.       And when does he file the Rule 35 motion?     Because it says at any time.       No, it doesn't say that. It says a court may correct an illegal sentence "at any time."     I'm talking -       It has nothing to do with mercy.     I want to know how it works.     He says there's a legal error in my sentence.     When -- how does he get that corrected?       I have -- I'm not -- don't take what I have as my view.     I just want the fact.     I'm asking you a fact.     When -- how and when does the person correct the legal error in his sentence?       Where?       And if the trial court says no, what does he do?       Fine.     Okay.     So now we have two appeals.     One is from the judgment of conviction; another is from the judgment imposing the sentence.     Now, the Federal statute says a 1-year period of limitation shall apply from the date on which the judgment became final.     Correct?       Okay.     When is the date on which the judgment of the sentence became final?       And if they are not appealing -- they are not -- they are not at the same time, then what?       Why not the sentence?       In April, they affirm the conviction.     In June, they affirm the sentence.     Do those 2 months -- does the date on which the judgment became final by conclusion of direct review, does that run from April or from June?       June.     Okay.     Now, suppose he doesn't -- suppose that there were no appeal from the -- I see.     Our problem is that there is no appeal from the judgment -- from the sentence where he asks for correction as a matter of mercy and not law.       There may be?       What I'm trying to figure out is why, if you're willing to call, for purposes of one -- the 1-year statute begins to run from the time the direct appeal becomes final.     Why is it a direct appeal of a sentence where you appeal the matter of law and it isn't a direct appeal of a sentence where you ask for mercy?     It's the same rule.     It's the same procedure.       This would help you just as much, I imagine.     I'm just trying to get it straight in my mind.       I know.     You see, my basic question is:     Why -- look, two appeals; one judgment, one sentence.     Okay?     January, June.     You're prepared to say the 1-year statute does not begin to -- to run until June.     Fine.     The Rule 35 motion, when you took an appeal, became final for purposes of the Federal habeas statute in June. So why doesn't the Rule 35 motion become final under (1)(a) of the habeas statute, whenever that's decided finally?     Why is it collateral at all? Why isn't it direct, just as your first one was direct?       Wait a minute.     Judgment of what?     Judgment of conviction -       -- or judgment of sentence?       That's not the same reason that it doesn't become final when you haven't appealed your sentence yet, or when they haven't -- they didn't consolidate. I am quite confused, as you see, as to how this all works in Rhode Island.     I -- Rhode Island -- I used to be on the First Circuit.     I know it has some special ways of doing things that are sometimes different, and this is different.       There must be in Rhode Island some complaints about the sentence.       Both.
09-893 +++$+++        Your brother says that the --       You have to -- you would do it differently, because they might be telling the truth. The example that your brother lawyer gave is this:     That we have a State and the State says, if you have a contract, in the dispute resolution provision, whether you have arbitration or not, that provision is void if it says you won't have a judge, and it's void if it says you won't have a jury, and it's void if it says that you will not go to the United States courthouse for deciding all Federal claims. That applies whether there is an arbitration clause or not an arbitration clause.     Now, that would seem to me no subterfuge.     It is absolutely clear.     They are not lying.     It just happens to prevent arbitration. And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that once you get into class actions you will discover you have something that really looks like a court case.     You have to have discovery, you have dozens of lawyers involved, you have depositions, you are running off every 5 minutes to the judge or to somebody to say is this deposition good, bad or indifferent.     You have methods for enforcing the deposition.     You have all kinds of things. He can make a much bigger list than me.     So he says:     This case is like the case of California saying everybody can decide it any way they want as long as they do it before a Federal judge.     Okay?     Now what's your answer to that?       But what's your answer to his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue, which you concede is a discrimination?       What about -- what about a rule that says what you have to have in any contract is a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but you have to follow exactly those procedures?       Okay.     Now, why isn't this obstacle preemption?       Where do we look to find the answer?     I mean, I understand your answer and I know the other side's going to say:     Well, this is a tremendous obstacle.     If I have one person to deal with, I say:     You want your $75, I will offer you $75, and if you don't take it and I turn out to be wrong, I'm going to give you $7,500.     That's their system.     Right? So they say the alternative is class action. There are a million customers.     I'm faced with a claim for $75 million.     I can't afford that.     I'll settle it, even if I'm right.     So if you have your rule, I'm going to be facing these things all the time.     I'm not -- I'm not going to enter into arbitration agreements.     I will take my chances in court.     Okay?     Now, that -- that's their argument. So it is empirical, in part:     What do I look to?     It's not logic.     It's a question of where should I -- what should I read to show, in your opinion, you're right?
09-9000 +++$+++        I agree think that sounds like -- I would interpret his complaint as what he wants is the DNA.     He thinks it's going to be exculpatory.     He doesn't know that till he gets it. So look at Dotson.     Dotson says that you go into habeas if winning -- i.e., getting the DNA -- would necessarily spell speedier release.     End of the matter. I'm reading to you from Justice Scalia's concurrence where he quotes my majority with great praise. (Laughter.)       No, not whether you -- what he's worried about -- he can speak for himself -- but as I read the concurrence, he was worried that if you win and take 1983 away, all kinds of things will be stuffed into habeas which don't belong there.     And that may be a true and correct criticism, but whether it is or not, he has agreed, indeed, nine members or seven members or something of the Court agreed, that the test I read to you is the test. And now, if that's the test, getting the DNA does not necessarily spell speedier release; it all depends on what the -- on what that DNA shows.     So why isn't that end of the matter?       So that's a totally different area, because in Dotson when -- I think what we did do was go through every of these -- every one of the prior cases, and they did involve for the most part the attack, as you say, on prison procedure.     And those cases where the attack on the proceeding would have restored good-time credits, there it was shortening the -- the length of confinement. In those cases where there was a general attack on procedures, but the procedure would simply be carried on better later, like parole, there wasn't.     You suddenly focused me on a whole new set of areas.     Where in the case law is this different rule that the rule we just said has nothing to do with it, if it's in the case?     That's basically what you are arguing.     What should I read to show that you were right on that?       In the particular -       I see your point, but I want to go back to try to understand this. And we have the Dotson point, and you said there are two other cases, Preiser and Heck.     So what Dotson says about Preiser is that the plaintiff there wanted the shortening of his term of confinement.     He wanted good-time credits to be restored.     And as we read it then, the shortening of the term of confinement is what made it proper in habeas.     But we added that if it hadn't been for that, if it hadn't attacked the duration of the physical confinement, it wouldn't be habeas; it would be 1983. In Heck, the same thing.     They were establishing the basis for a damages claim that necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the conviction.     Where that was so, there would be habeas. Where that was not so, even if successful, it would not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment, the action should be allowed to proceed in 1983.     So as we read those two cases, they stood for the exact principle I described. Now, you want, perfectly fairly, to say: But we didn't read them correctly, or we shouldn't have read them as exclusively to say what I've just read. Fine. What is it, in your opinion, precisely, that we should have the principle of distinguishing the one from habeas corpus if we were to abandon as an exclusive test what we said, and I just read you in those three cases:     Dotson, Preiser, Heck?     What's your contrary approach?       But if -- in Heck itself, we said a 1983 action, where it is -- even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment, a 1983 action should be allowed to proceed. Now, I take it what you're suggesting is we say that sentence is wrong or overstated, that there is another circumstance.       Even though it will not demonstrate that the judgment was wrong, it still should not be allowed in 1983 if it is, quote, "related to" the criminal case itself.     Something like that is what you're proposing.     Or what is it you're proposing?       Say what it is, then.     Say what it is.       It's part of a process where you hope to demonstrate.     Can you bring in habeas a motion, let's say, to examine police files?       No, no.     This isn't Brady. What you say is I have a right under criminal law here that everybody has that I can go back and take depositions of the -- you have a reason for doing it. You want to take their depositions because you want to show that something wasn't followed.     Can you do that in habeas?       Is there a Federal law - is there a Federal statute that -- you can't say yet whether it's invalid.     We don't know.     What we want is to get the information that will help us make that decision.     We think there is a law that entitles us to that right.     Can you bring that in habeas or not?       The library.     I want to use the prison library, same example.       I want to use the prison library 9:00 to 3:00, because that's when I work on my efforts to upset my conviction.     Now -- I mean, it's the same as Justice Kagan -       -- provided.     What about that?
09-907 +++$+++        You're -       The -- sorry.     Are you finished?       Go ahead.       Finish, yes.       I think it is -- well, I'm trying to work out what was his point.     And I don't blame him for this.     But trying to figure it out, he says look:     This whole thing was written for a different purpose than the IRS, and if we start reading all those things from the beginning into the tables, we're really going to get into a mess.     For example, we are going to give people deductions when they have lease payments, even though they're not owners when they have lease payments.     The company owns -- not even an ownership expense, but it does say use the lease payment.     And then it has all these other things. So forget it; do a simple thing.     It says ownership expense.     You go to the registry of motor vehicles and you say, is Smith the owner?     And they'll tell you, yes or no.     And if the answer is yes, he deducts $471.     Sometimes that's too little; sometimes that's too much.     But once we depart from that, we're really in a nightmare of trying to figure out what all these things mean that were written for other purposes. So, what do you say to that?
09-958 +++$+++        Why?       I'm -- I'm not certain of this.     I find this a difficult case.     It seems to me the Government is prepared to concede that if an individual has a Federal right that he'd like to enforce and someone is trying to block it by asserting a State law that he thinks is pre-empted, he can go ahead.     If it looks as if the State is going to take something from him that a Federal law guarantees and he has a defense that he'd like to make to that under Federal law, the State law that seems to allow it is pre-empted, he can make it. Our problem arises where neither of those things is true.     So, we say, what is true here?     What kind of Federal claim does he have?     And the word is that rates have to be -- that the rate that the State has to pay back to the doctor has to be "sufficient." Okay, "sufficient."     That's basically the word.       All right.     So, I see three possibilities.     One is you say, sure, let all the doctors go and sue.     There are only 50,000 kinds of reimbursement.     Maybe there are a million.     I don't know how many.     And they only take place in, what, say, 400,000 counties.     And we will have Federal judges reaching different views about what is sufficient in each of those different places.     And sometimes they will agree.     Did Congress want that?     Well, hmm, a problem. The second way of going about it is cure that and say:     You win, but you have to use primary jurisdiction, and you have to get the government's view on it, Judge; and before you decide, you have to pay attention.       There's a long line of cases.     I have one more thing --       -- then you'll get all three.       Yes.       If I want your view, I want your view on whether the right approach -- you're saying what's the status quo pending.     And I want your view on these three possibilities.       One is the possibility the judges just do it in all the different places, try to figure out what's sufficient.     The second is the possibility that we try primary jurisdiction, and that's the -- then the curlicue on that is what do you do pending?     And, you know, that's your injunction.       Yes, yes.     And the third possibility is you say:     I'm just sorry that the -- this is just too vague, the "sufficient" et cetera.     It has to be centralized.     There's no way to work this out with all these different judges and different kinds of rates and different kinds of provisions.     And so, this is an instance where you cannot bring your claim that something violates the Supremacy Clause because you don't have a Federal right to a thing, and they're not trying to take away a thing that the Federal right gives you, et cetera. All right.     Do you see those three possibilities?       And what I wanted you to do is to address them.       Yes.       You think primary jurisdiction is the way to do it.       You see, I see a practical problem, and I'm -- the practical problem is millions of rates all judged by the term "sufficient," and instead of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we do have a lot of judges.       Right.       There must be a limit. There must be a limit because if there is not a limit on what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my office and I look at the statute books and they are just filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I had all the State statute books, it would be 15 offices or 20 or 100.     And I know perfectly well that a lot of those statutes in the Federal books have to do with agencies, and they give jobs to agencies, and it's perfectly apparent that the ones who run those statutes in many instances are the agencies, and really judges are out of it. Now, if I adopt your line, it seems to me I am saying that any time that a person has an individual of saying that a State law is contrary to one of those statutes, he can run right into court.     And I can see we've done that where he has some kind of right that he's protecting that's threatened in some way or that he wants to assert.     I can see that we could do that in the foreign policy case like Burma; I can see that we could do that where Federal voting rights are at stake, which are very important. But a principle that says you can do that any time you want seems to me a little -- it's -- it seems to me the real fear of far-reaching in this extent that it just stops the agency from doing their business at the behest of anyone who would like to assert a State law, or States -- it's a mess, in other words.       No, no.     Your people have your problem.       But some other people have another problem.       The doctors want to be paid more money or at least not paid as much as they were; I understand that.       Yes.       So, is there a medical exception?       Is there a medical exception?     Is it that you can have this generalized claim if you're a doctor, but not others?
09-987 +++$+++        See, can I ask you -       So you assume that it is a -- I see your argument there. Now, in Zelman, the holding, I would think -- which I was not in agreement with, but it's now law, that a government can have a -- a spending program. And what they did was the government spent money in the form of vouchers to be given to private individuals to use for such education as they wish, that met certain standards, including religious schools. So what's the difference between the program here and the one that was held constitutional in Zelman?       But who here says to the parent, who is going to the school, what is your religion?       In other words, the STO gives a scholarship only to Catholics -       -- to go to Catholic schools, only to Jews to go to Jewish schools?       Well, suppose they change one rule, and the rule that the STOs had was this:     They said we will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify for your child to go to the school that you wish to go to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic School, that's absolutely fine; they won't keep you out, and vice versa. Now, in your opinion, that then would be constitutional?       Yes?     The answer is yes?       So the only thing you're challenging is the rule that they will not -- the STOs will not give the scholarship to a Protestant to go to a Catholic school.       How do we know they would -- that that's the rule?       Ah.     Ah, but that's -       But that's -- that's different.     You were complaining about is they would - look, I'm Jewish; I want my child, let's say, to go to St. Joseph's; and -- so now, do I qualify or not?     The only thing -       Your -- your complaint is only with the STOs that wouldn't let me send the child.       We know that they exist because?       Well, if you didn't -       Let's suppose you didn't.       What's the problem with that?     That is to say, suppose that the government gives its money to put CAT scans in hospitals.     And it has certain beneficiaries, and one group of beneficiaries is the Association of Catholic Hospitals, another is the Association Of Jewish Hospitals, another is a set of totally secular hospitals.     So it gives the tax credits to all three.     Now, of course, the Catholic group is going to give it to Catholic hospitals and so forth. What's wrong with that?       What they do is they have government money, just like you claim this is, and they say we are going to give it to some -- to umbrella organizations, like the Association of Catholics, Jewish, or secular hospitals, and we expect them to distribute it.     And they will, of course, distribute it to those who are their members.     And in some cases, their members are religious organizations, and in some cases, they're not.     Now, what's the difference between that and what happens here, leaving the student out of it?       The beneficiaries of the government -- Catholic hospital -- government CAT scan program will be Catholic hospitals, because they're the ones who belong to the Catholic hospital association. Money will also go to the secular hospital association, as it goes -- would go to a secular STO here.     So I don't see that part.     That's the last prong we're talking about.       The government says - that's the difference -- the government says -- it does give the money away on a religiously neutral basis.     It gives it to hospital associations.     It turns out that some of those naturally are supposed to give it to their members, all of whom will be religiously affiliated.
09-993 +++$+++        It appears also that the - it's Buckman, it seems to me, the relevant case, not Wyeth, because what -- if -- you're now saying, I've learned, that -- that they have a set of FDA duties; they must tell the FDA every detail.       That sounds awfully familiar to Buckman, where the State claim was basically a claim of fraud on the FDA.     And we said it's not up to the State to -- to -- they can't bring -- have a claim for fraud on the FDA.     The FDA has to enforce their own stuff.     And why isn't the same true here, that the FDA has to enforce their own legal requirement to tell us everything you know?     What's the answer to that?       No, because Levine involves the Wyeth case, right?       No.     The -- the difference there is the difference that the SG points out:     There is a broad-ranging obligation for the initial drugmaker to tell the FDA all kinds of things and change the warnings.     But here the FDA tells us they have no power to change their warnings.     They can't, unlike Levine. They have to copy the original maker.     So -- I'm -- I'm just referring there to the whole SG brief.       Be sure you answer, please, my original question.       Suppose they had.     Suppose that -- is a generic required to file adverse incident reports?       Okay.     Now, imagine a company that files every adverse incident report, complies completely; period.     Now, in your view does it have an additional obligation?       And what is that?       Okay.       Now, their argument is that in respect to their failure to do the first, that's Buckman.     That is similar to Buckman.       Now.     And that's what I - now, as to the second, it just doesn't add anything. The FDA has all that information.       All right.     Now, why is it?       Your basic argument, I'm getting this now, that -- I think -- is that the failure is, where State law has a right to enter, is to require them to keep track of adverse incidents and other things in the -- and do their best to change the label, which will consist of going to the FDA, likely, and asking them to change.
09-996 +++$+++        Well, that's a puzzle to me.     I mean, Justice Scalia's question was courts all the time -- they -- you used see all the time they don't decide an issue of whether it's filed too late because it's the simplest thing just to decide the merits.     It's the same result.     And sometimes they don't do that.     But that happens often in a district court on appeal and triple in a supreme court which has hundreds or thousands of questions for review.     So how do we know that that simple practice, which I've never heard of as attacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that isn't what's going on?       All right, but that's - they -- what's your point?     Eight hundred are silent. What does that show?       Why?       Well, I mean, but then you can make any claim against him.     I mean, what I wonder -- maybe this is where I'm leading -- the California Supreme Court is not the only court in California where people file for habeas petitions, is it?       Yes.     So why, if there's inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at the decisions of the appellate courts which write their reasons down, and then you would know whether it is being decided -- applied inconsistently or not inconsistently.     Why look at a blank wall?     Why not look at people who write opinions?     And then you'll find out.       No, of course not.     But is your claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding, are you denying, are you just saying nothing about whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of substantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for - that's the rule, isn't it?       All right.     Are you saying it is being applied consistently or inconsistently or you do not know -       -- in all courts below the California Supreme Court?       So you don't know.     So what you've come -- what you've done your research on are questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies something, but you haven't looked into the research that is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that write opinions.     Is that -- have I gotten that correctly?       Because if that's correct -       All right.     Then I don't see why you didn't because it would be so easy, if you're right, to show this from the lower courts, but of course if you're wrong, it wouldn't be easy, then a blank wall is better than nothing. Now, what can you say that will disabuse me of the notion that I just expressed?       No, no.     But some are - there's a thing called sampling techniques, and sampling techniques are designed to limit the burden.     I'm not saying it wouldn't be burdensome, but you have examined thousands of cases.     And so I'm back to my original question.     And statisticians, many of whom would like to help you perhaps you could find some, could do this for you, I think.       The wrong court.     And amicus did it from the time that -- that the case was filed, while the rule is you start the period of running from the case it was reasonably -- the person should reasonably have known his issue, which isn't the same time as the time his case was decided against him.     So, yes.       That's true.       But it's like having rules; when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find impossible cases that you should have heard because it was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you give the people equitable discretion to depart from it, and pretty soon you get litigation over that.     I mean, there's no perfect system.       Well, what about -- that's why I go back to the lower courts.     If there really is a problem here, why wouldn't the bar look into how well this practice is working in the lower courts and find out, well, what is the practice?     How do they use it? Do we want more flexibility?     Do we want more definite rules?     That's -- I agree that you put your finger on a problem, an important problem.     I'm not at all certain that the one system is better or required or compulsory.
10-10 +++$+++        Think of what the Government says should happen.     You should give them a form and the form should say do you have money to pay or not.     All right.     So, what did happen?     Did the judge ever ask him?       Did he bring some proof of employment?       All right.     So, why would you put him in jail?     He has no job.       You mean he didn't believe him about what?     That he had no money?       Okay.     So, he -- he thought he did have the money.       Do we -       I'm actually trying to find -       Just out of curiosity -       Fine, but I'd like to ask a different question. I'm trying to find out what happened here that was different from what the Government suggests. The Government suggests provide a piece of paper and to ask certain questions.     What I'd like to know is what's different in this proceeding from what the Government suggests?       That would have -- perhaps on no one else, but could have an effect on the way I decide the case.       I understand there was no -- look.     If he asked the questions orally -       -- I might be tempted to say it doesn't matter.     So, I'm trying to say what really differed from what the Government wants?       And skip that one.     What I'm trying to figure out -- and I'm sorry, I may be the only one trying to -- I'm trying to figure out what, in general, is the fairness of such situations in -- where the woman is normally the one with the child, the man is normally the one who doesn't pay. Is it true, for example, that in most such situations across the country, the woman has a lawyer, but the man doesn't?     Is that true or isn't it true? There must be some organization that's studied that.       Okay.     So, the answer to what I think of, in my own mind only, as very relevant, whether the woman has a lawyer but the man doesn't, is: I don't know.       And that is the answer?     We don't have good information on that?       Okay.     Fine.     Yes.       Did anybody look at housing courts?       I mean, housing courts -- I would think it's fairly common somebody owes somebody $25, or whatever it is, the judge says pay it into court, and what happens if they don't pay it into court?
10-1001 +++$+++        All right.     This is -- I'll not -- we'll say this is my argument.     I don't want to make this your friend's argument. In Arizona, there was a trial, and defendant thinks trial counsel was inadequate.     Then there was a collateral review, and Arizona appoints a lawyer for that.     And after that, the Arizona courts thought, no, he was adequate at trial.     This particular defendant wants to say that that lawyer was inadequate, too.     In fact, it was the same one.     Hardly surprising.     All right?     That's his view. Now, when he makes that argument in Federal court, I guess he's going to be met with the claim, since Arizona didn't have to appoint the lawyer for collateral review, it doesn't matter what that lawyer does.     Is that right?       Yes.       Just follow the questions. The question is, if he tries to make the claim he does, want to say that my first lawyer was no good at trial, and my second lawyer, who by coincidence was the same in the collateral proceeding, was no good either, then the State comes in and says:     You can't make that -- you can't make that argument now because we had a proceeding called the collateral review proceeding.     We didn't have to give you a lawyer there.     But even if that lawyer was inadequate, you lose because we didn't have to give you one. Am I right about that?       That's all I want to know.       Yes.       All right -- no, no.     You say -- I'll answer it.     It is enough to give him a lawyer.     Okay?     It is enough.     But you have to give him an adequate lawyer if you give him one.     If you give him one.     You don't have to give him one.     But if you give him one, it has to be adequate.     Now, what about that?       All right, but would that -- it does.     That's what I think we're at.     Now, why not say this, that every defendant has to have one fair shot at claiming -- they can make the claim that his trial lawyer was inadequate?     And the State doesn't have to give him a lawyer at collateral review, but if it does, then that lawyer, he can say, couldn't make that claim because he was inadequate.     So, you say, fine, they can make that argument in habeas.     I bet they never win it. But somebody might.     He can make it. So, what would happen would be that the habeas judge in Federal habeas would read the piece of paper.     He'd say, what's the ground for thinking this? And then he'd make his normal kinds of judgments. Now, what is -- is there anything wrong with that view?     Is it absolutely blocked by precedent?     It seems to me it would relieve the concerns of the States about worrying about having to appoint a lot of lawyers, and it gives him a fair shot to make his argument.       Because?       Well, that's -- that's where you'd have to make the exception.     You'd say, if you give him a counsel, he does have the right to an effective assistance of counsel insofar as the ineffectiveness would prevent him from raising a claim that, to be fair, the trial itself has to be -- has to -- he has to have that about the trial itself.     That exception.     There would be that exception.     Now, is there something in those cases that blocks that exception?       Well, in a sense it does, but he's never going to win the infinite continuum.       You never have to give him a lawyer at all.       What about not going that far?     What about saying:     In this case -- in this case, Arizona did give him a lawyer.     In this case, it was the same lawyer.     In this case, the proceeding was filed prior to the completion of the appeal and ended before the completion of the appeal.     So, for this case, this counts as the one round of proceedings, and, therefore, his client can in fact assert that that single individual who was his lawyer was incompetent in those proceedings that ended -- didn't end prior to the termination of the appeal, ended first.       No, but it didn't face the issue of what about a claim that you have a constitutional right to bring up at least once?     And this is the first time he was able to bring it up.     So in other words, Coleman didn't face this problem.     It's as if you couldn't bring up the claim that the judge was sleeping until you got to collateral proceedings.     A State could have such a rule.     I don't know why they would, but they could.     But if they did, it would be your first chance ever to attack that trial process, and so isn't Coleman, in its effort to bar relitigation, actually rather beside the point?       No.       No, no, we're saying it the same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it because he was staring at the ceiling and had been drinking too much.     Just as he could raise that point in habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera.
10-1016 +++$+++        Now let's think of the man. Let's think of the man.     The man would like to look after the family, say, for 6 weeks.     And he gets sick 4 weeks.     How many weeks have we got?       All right.       So -- perfect. So, now the employer is sitting -- and it will work with other numbers.     I don't rely on those alone. (Laughter.)       But now look what happens. Without this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be out of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it, we have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay?     Maybe for 6. With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone for 10.     You see? And so, the comparison there -- and it will work with whatever numbers you want.     The comparison there is very different.     And the comparison doesn't -- doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman. We have three different rationales.     All of them are related to a serious problem, which is the problem of discrimination against women because the employers think they'll be home more.     And so, you see the conclusion I'm drawing?     Yes, okay.     So -- so, where are we?       No, it doesn't have to, of course.     But the whole point of the question that I was asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately is it helps your case.     But if we look at what Congress was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole. That's my point that I want you to answer.     And they're trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)? Yes, (D).     If I look at it without (D), the ratio will disfavor the woman.     And if I look at it with (D), suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over -- over hiring a man -- it goes way down.     And that helps women. And that is why, I think -- reading this and listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of the other, because working with that 12-week limitation and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute that doesn't defeat itself.     We now have a statute that actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not discriminate against women.     Not perfectly, but there's a big improvement. And that's the -- that's the argument I'm making.     You have to read it as a whole to see that. And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to that.     Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want to hear what you say.       He was.       He was -- he's absolutely right, and that's why this isn't a health spa thing, (D).     This is -- in fact, has two independent reasons, that all -- the miscarriage reason and the Pregnancy Act reason.     And so, it isn't just saying go to a health spa. But I mean, I don't want to put arguments in your mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like there anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your going on with this discussion in respect to what Justice Alito and I have been talking about, and I'd be interested in what you think.
10-1018 +++$+++        What would have happened if Abraham Lincoln today were there?     And I gather what happened is they thought the local prosecutor is good, but Lincoln is better.     So, we'll let Lincoln prosecute this case. Now, in your view, Abraham Lincoln would not have had immunity, but the local prosecutor would have.       They did exactly the same thing, by the way; it was just that Lincoln had a better reputation.     Every word was the same.       But in your -- I'm asking you, in your opinion, when I write this opinion, is I could say not even Abraham Lincoln, when he acted as a public prosecutor brought in for the occasion?     In your opinion, he should not have the immunity that Joe Jones, the local prosecutor, would have?       I'm just trying to get your opinion.       Is it because it's Abraham Lincoln or --       But investigatory functions -- they don't get immunity.     So, if Lincoln had looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into this; I don't think we should prosecute.     And what they said was use your judgment.       Okay.     So, there are problems with both standards both ways.     This is one of the things that -- that is bothering me.       Imagine in this case the lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor and so forth, and they said -- not necessarily this event; they said we want to do X.     And the lawyer said: I have to tell you, it's unclear whether X is constitutional or not.     Now, because it's unclear, I also have to tell you that if you do it, you will not be held personally liable. Now, can a lawyer give that advice?     Yes. When he does, of course, he's subjecting himself to personal liability.     Now, it's that conflict that is worrying me, among other things. So, what do we do about that?     The lawyer is being asked to give advice to the client.     Under the canons of ethics, he ought to have their interest at heart, and in doing that, he's subjecting himself to what could be hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars worth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice. Is there a way that we side with you out of that dilemma?       No, no, no.     What I'm assuming in the question is, since it's a close question, he has to worry about a court saying:     You were wrong in saying it was legal.     It was not legal. The matter was unclear, but it was not legal. At that point, he becomes subject to much damages.     But, of course, the others do not, and he had to tell them go ahead with it.     You understand my point.       So, what is the answer?       Well, that may be, but what I'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules?     If we don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and you agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my hypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of rules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's too bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it, or something else.     That's why I want your answer.       I change it slightly, and he puts them up to it.       Because I don't know why he couldn't.     I mean, you know, he says go do it.     Or, in other words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead.
10-1024 +++$+++       Can you tell me what your 6     response is to the Government's argument that the Privacy Commission which was set up understood the word 8     "actual damages" at the time the way they understand it? 9     What's your response to that?    I -- are they right about that in your opinion?      So, am I right in saying 24     your -- you would agree with them that that is how the 25     Privacy Commission understood the Act, but in your opinion, the Privacy Commission was wrong?      This would save me some 9     time possibly, but my guess is, and you may know, that 10     every State or many States have statutes or tort laws or 11     something against invasion of privacy.    Now, you may 12     know how many.    And -- and if you know how many, that's 13     helpful.    And of those, if you know how many, how many 14     of them, and perhaps all, provide damages for mental 15     suffering caused by a violation of that particular 16     tort-like provision?      Do you know enough to know      Okay.
10-1042 +++$+++        Well, in 1992, they promulgated the regulation, which is the strongest argument I think on the other side.     It's a strong argument.     Have you -- has anybody looked at that notice-and-comment proceeding?     Have you looked at it?       All right.     If you have, do they go into this point, a point about -- the point being this is a kickback statute?     It isn't an overcharge price regulation statute.     Therefore, promulgating a regulation that makes it a crime, a Federal crime, to overcharge, which is what the regulation says, is outside the scope of the statute. Now, did someone make that argument?     If so, I'd like to be able to read it, and I'd like to be able to see what the agency said in response.       So, you would say -- is it --       Is this a fair statement in your view -- and we'll hear theirs on rebuttal -- that in respect to the 1992 regulation, there is a sentence which says, "A charge by a person for which ... nominal services are performed ... is an unearned fee and violates this section"?     All right?     I've ellipsed part. All right.     Now, it says that.     And that later on is taken as being:     This statute is a -- to that extent, a price regulation statute. Is it fair to say that notice of such a regulation was not given?       Was comment received in respect to that?       All right.       That's -- no, no.     That's a good question, and your problem is different people feel differently about the answer.     So, the -- which is why from my perspective --- and perhaps you're only answering a question for me and no one else has it -- but I would be pretty interested to know whether when you looked at the legislative history of this, what you discovered was a lot of complaints about consumers paying for things they didn't get, period.     Which favors HUD's interpretation. Or whether you see a whole long list of complaints about consumers having to pay referral fees, where that's just one person taking advantage of another person's business.     I would -- I think it would be relevant.     And then if you've looked at all this, which you could tell me you haven't -- I will try to -- but what do you find?
10-1062 +++$+++        Why?     You say "practical." The order itself says that.     It says you don't do it, you're going to get penalized up to 32.5, which is now 37.       How can they bring an action?     I'd like some clarification here.     The Corps's regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit. I mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day after getting this order, you'd run up against the reg, which says we won't give you any after the fact -- we won't even consider this matter, until any required initial corrective measures are made. And then, just to be safe, they say that no permit application will be accepted unless the Corps determines that concurrent processing of an after-the-fact permit application is clearly appropriate.     "Clearly." So, I looked at those two things and said, of course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers; they're not going to accept it unless you have a very unusual case.     So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong about that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted.     Maybe there are a lot.       Okay.     All right.     I agree. Then, if we agree, then look, for 75 years the courts have interpreted statutes with an eye towards permitting judicial review, not the opposite.       And yet -- so, here you're saying this statute that says nothing about it precludes review, and then the second thing you say is that this isn't final.     So, I read the order.     It looks like about as final a thing as I've ever seen.     So, tell me why I'm wrong on those two points.       Okay.     If it doesn't --       -- you're on the final part.       Is there anything you've got by -- I mean, I'm -- you've got me now into the area; we're applying the APA; and the question is Abbott Labs and is it final?     Well, here there doesn't seem anything more for the agency to do, and here the -- the person whom the order is directed against is being hurt a lot. So, the only thing I -- left in my mind here is the order itself does say come in and talk to us about this.     Which may suggest it isn't final.     So, do you have any information on that point?     That is, have you looked up or has the EPA told you that really when we issue these things, in fact people come in and we modify them X percent of the time?       Do you have any impression that you could tell us?       Do they --       This is not a warning.     I mean, really all you have to do is look at it.     I was quite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't say a warning.     It said this is an order.     It looks extremely formal.     I even overstated in your favor the question of negotiating because it doesn't say negotiating about changing the order; it says negotiating about amending the order.     And -- so, this is not just a warning, is it?       No, but the --       More of a -- that's what I'm trying to get you to talk about just for one minute. I mean, you're talking about a huge upheaval.     My honest impression is that it is the Government here that is fighting 75 years of practice --       -- because -- because the issue is the Abbott Labs issue of finality.       And, of course, a warning isn't reviewable.     But this seems to meet the test where that fails.     Now, please correct me if I'm wrong about the agency practice.     I can't find support for you --
10-1104 +++$+++        The specific case where the State remedy is not available is?       No, no, no, no.     Your --       Your allegation which you believe states a valid claim under Bivens action but not under State law is?       I don't understand specifically what they are.     I mean, it sounds to me that if a person (a) deliberately starves somebody to death, for example, or deliberately gives him something which will make him sick when he eats it, that that would at least be negligence and would arise under ordinary State tort law.     So, I'm curious to know what your claim is that does not arise under ordinary State tort law?       No, give me -- don't answer my -- forget my hypothetical.     Tell me your specific claim that does not arise under State tort law.     That's all I want to know.     Which is the same question I heard -- I just didn't hear the answer to.       I heard the answer in general.       I want to know specifically what you say they did to your client that doesn't make out a State tort claim.       I heard you say --       -- that.     I just want to know what it is physically you say the defendant did to your client, so that I can evaluate your statement that California gives no tort remedy for that.       Sorry, I don't mean to sound irritated, but I just have trouble getting my question across.       All right.     They failed to give him adequate food for what?     So he could live, or for what?       They gave him -- and if a person in California who has charge of -- of a ward or someone fails adequately to nourish that ward, you're saying California tort law gives no remedy?       I would call it like negligence, you give a remedy.     If it's not negligent, it's deliberate?     Or what?       It seems odd to me because the Eighth Amendment says cruel and unusual punishment. So, you have to have a cruel treatment.     And where a person deliberately or negligently subjects someone else to cruel treatment, my -- my law school recollection of many years ago is that there ordinarily is a tort action. So, that's what I'd like you -- I'm suspicious of your statement that there isn't.       Therefore, I ask for some elaboration of that.       When I went to law school, which was many years ago, instead of talking about, like, starvation cases or medical malpractice, they talked about a general thing called negligence.       And it seemed to apply to doctors, and then it was medical malpractice, and it applied to others, and -- and is there something here that wouldn't fall in that general kind of rubric or the general terms of California tort law?       And I know, I don't want you just to repeat yourself.       So, I guess I have the best answer I have.       I would find that rather surprising, too, actually. (Laughter.)       Because I -- I think what they're asking to do is fine.     On their theory, you have no problem because you go back and show to the court that there is no remedy in California for shackling a person, I guess, deliberately, with knowledge that that would cause severe pain, and if you can show that, then you're going to have your Bivens action in respect to that.       That -- what they're saying is that you're not going to be able to show that; so, it doesn't worry them.
10-1121 +++$+++        Can you think of for a second -- to go back to Justice Sotomayor.     Now, I would like you to see, I think, why she asked the question. As I understand it, the way it works now is at the beginning of, say, September -- say it goes September -- September.     September of year two, we look back to year one, and we see what the percentages were. And now we in the union calculate a budget for year two. And we go and get approval or opt-outs on that basis. Now, what I thought coming in here is that the problem was going to be, if you have to have a new notice in the middle of the year for special political assessments, you're going to discover that half the time you don't know if they're special political assessments. It's an impossible line to draw.     It's really tough. You're making the argument that however you draw the line, we're on the right side of it, not the wrong side.     Isn't that what -- basically what you're saying?     It's not a special assessment.     It wasn't really -- et cetera.     Okay. Now -- but there's a new argument that's come along that I hadn't focused on, that we can avoid the administrative problem by saying all special assessments require a new notice, whether they're for political purposes or not.     Hence the question that I was trying to get -- I was very interested in your answer.     If we had that rule, which avoids the problem of saying which is which, how does that affect the union?     Not necessarily yours but unions in general. How often is it that you draw up your budget for year two in September, you put it into effect, and then during the year, you discover you need more money from people for any reason, and, therefore, you change what you thought they were going to contribute?     How often, if you can give us an estimate -- and you're in a better position than I.     Does it happen a lot, rarely, a little?     What do you want to say?
10-114 +++$+++  
10-1150 +++$+++       Look, anything can be 2     transformed into a process.    Look at those real estate 3     ones, the -- I mean, you know, lawyers ones.    I have a 4     way of making a great argument in the Supreme Court. 5     You know, you could patent some of your arguments. 6                 (Laughter.)      Well, I'll add a little bit 19     to this because I am questioning what you say here in 20     the other direction.    You say if you just look at 21     everything minus the law of nature, hmm, and that is a 22     process that's otherwise known or obvious in light of 23     the prior art, you can't patent it.    That seems to me 24     maybe it goes too far the other direction, because we 25     know that a lot of work goes into these laws of nature.      Yes, but I -- all right. 4     So, there are both parts, but I'm more interested in -- 5                 GENERAL VERRILLI Take, for example, nuclear stress tests that 12     cardiologists use.    That's a process.    The patient gets 13     on a treadmill.    The heart rate gets elevated. Radioactive dye gets put into the body.    It allows an 15     image to be taken of the heart with an X-ray machine. 16     That improves treatment.    Now, the transformation there 17     is, as in this case, incidental to the process.    It's 18     not the point of the process.    But I don't think anyone 19     would suggest that that's not a patentable process, but 20     under Mayo's test, it's not a patentable process. 21                 Similarly, I think -- I'm sorry, 22     Mr. Chief Justice.      Yes, but this drug is patentable because it's a -- it's a -- what is the third 7     word?    You know, it's a combination of nature.    What's 8     the --    it's a composition of matter.      You'd say -- you would say 15     that where it's a new use there were some specifications, and the specifications limited the area 17     to over here, I think -- and tell me if I'm wrong 18     because I'm really asking just a question.    They limit 19     it over here, you see.    And now we have a new use, and 20     we're saying this composition of matter is being used 21     over here.    So, aren't you getting a -- simply a 22     different area where you're using a composition of 23     matter.      That isn't a process 3     patent.      Is a process --      All right.    I'll think about it.      I thought of two examples 8     that will try to get you to talk about the problem 9     that's really bothering me here, anyway.      And if you -- if the two I 11     just mentioned are valid, there is something wrong with 12     this picture.      Where is -- where is lack 2     of novelty?    Nobody has these numbers before.    They 3     always thought it was a quarter, an eighth of an inch, 4     and -- it's huge novelty.      Assume with me the eighth 13     versus quarter of an inch, which is the law of nature 14     part, is not obvious.      No, no.    My question is, 23     what has to be added to a law of nature to make it a 24     patentable process?      And if you put too little 2     in the answer to that question, I believe I can take 3     things like E equals MC squared and make them 4     patentable.      And if you put too much in, 7     you're going to wreck your own case.    So, I'm very 8     interested in hearing --      What about a process that 2     all the steps are -- it's a process to -- to generate 3     some useful information.      All right?    Fine.    And the 6     only new thing about it is the useful information. 7     Anything like that in history, any patent case that you 8     can -- that comes to mind that you say that was okay? 9     Can you think of one?      No, no.    That's not what 19     I'm thinking of.    I'm thinking of a patent to find 20     useful information that chickens can only eat so much 21     chicken food.    That nobody has ever known before, you 22     know.    Okay.    Now -- or something like that.    But they 23     tell you the useful information that's going to be found 24     right in the patent.    In other words, we have a patent 25     to discover some useful information, and here is the useful information, and now here's -- see, this is what 2     their complaint is.      But you don't know what 8     you're going to find because you don't know how much ore 9     you're going to find?    Let's see.    Okay.    Let me think about it.    Thank you.      What's your view?    What's 14     your view?
10-1195 +++$+++       Well, this is the part 17     that's worrying me.    On your side, it's hard, and it's 18     an unusual statute, but the -- certainly -- and I agree 19     with you that the language of the statute suggesting a 20     kind of reverse pre-emption, something like that, and 21     certainly Senator Hollings' comment, and certainly the 22     fact that they specifically provide for an attorney 23     general to bring an action in State court suggests that 24     they wanted the smaller private actions in State -- I 25     mean, in Federal court -- in State court; that favors you. All right.    But then I thought, as you were 3     speaking, what about diversity jurisdiction?    And -- and 4     I don't see why there wouldn't diversity jurisdiction in 5     terms of trying to get these out-of-State people.    And 6     if there's diversity jurisdiction, why in heaven's name 7     would they want to say but there is no "arising under" 8     jurisdiction?      So, I'm -- so, I'm pushed 11     the other way by that.    So -- so, what do you think? 12     What do you think?      That's true.    So, there's a 15     "flooding the courts" problem.      Well, why wouldn't the -- 23     the problem that Justice Scalia just identified or you 24     were talking about suggest -- actually favor their side, 25     that that "in conformity with State law" is talking about procedure? I mean, imagine that State law has a 2-year 3     limitation period or a 1-year.    You see -- I don't know 4     what the limitation period is here.    It may be longer. 5     And so, what happens is where you go into -- if the 6     attorney general brings the action, you're going to say 7     it's 4 years, but if it's in a State court and a private 8     person, it would be 1 year?    That doesn't seem to me to 9     make sense. It then seems to make sense if you interpret 11     that provision as saying what court you could go into in 12     the State.    If the State permits you to go to the 13     superior court or the small claims court or the -- in 14     other words, procedural rules.      It did, but look what -- 19     well, how do you get out of the mess then -- what
10-1211 +++$+++        When Rosenberg would have been the law -- Fleuti -- and the answer to the question would have been, yes, you can make trips abroad, wouldn't it?       That's true, but in -- in St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but the time of the guilty plea.     And what the Court says there is that a person who is thinking of pleading guilty might well have taken into account the fact that he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about to be deported to exercise discretion in his favor. So, that's as I read those pages.     You can say why I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I read them.     And then, having read it that way, I thought the question in this case is whether the person who's sitting at the table and deciding whether to plead guilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead guilty, I can always ask for discretion.     That's St. Cyr. Well, if I plead guilty, I can still visit my aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could be of importance to some people, as opposed to whether I will never see them again.     Now, that seems to be the question. Is the second as likely to be in the person's mind as the first?     And to tell you the truth, I don't know the answer.     I mean, maybe it would be. There isn't that much chance of getting discretion.     It might be important to some people to visit their aging parents and grandparents.     So, go ahead.     Answer the question.     Is the one more important than the other? And if not, why not?       No, but I'm really asking you --       -- isn't my question the key question?     Now, you can answer that "no."     But -- I mean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that mattered to -- to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing that mattered, was visiting their parents and grandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even on that situation, it would make no difference, or you could say I think the one is as important as the other, or you could say they're not.     I just want to get your full answer, all -- your whole answer to my question.       All right.     But why do you -- look, as I read the statute, it isn't even clear whether it overrules Rosenberg v. Fleuti.     I mean, they talk about admission, but admission, after all, could have an exception for the 4-day trip.     That's what the Court said effectively in Rosenberg v. Fleuti. So, Congress certainly wasn't clear on what policy they're following.     I would have thought that. You can disagree with that.     But I -- because -- but the part that's still gnawing at me 95 percent of the people plead guilty.     All right.     You know.     Everybody pleads guilty.     All -- about.     About.     And now, the consequence that this ex post enacts is he can't take the 4-day trip. And you keep saying, well, a 4-day trip requires action on a person's part.     Right.     Of course, it does.     So, why does that matter?     I mean, the fact is he can't take the 4-day trip.     A 4-day trip requires action.     You have to buy a trip -- ticket.     You have to get on a plane.     So --       That's -- that's why I think the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of the statute are relevant.     Like with SORNA you would apply it backwards, because that's a pretty clear intent. I don't know about, you know, like, "three times and you're out" statutes, et cetera.     But -- but here you have the disability on the one -- the disadvantage to the person pleading guilty, that problem, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, you have the policy that with a -- fill in the blank -- with a statute that doesn't talk about it but simply uses a new definition of admission or admissibility. That's -- do you want to say something about that?       More than that, what is -- I'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the policy on the other side?     The policy that favors the retroactivity despite the fact that the person might not have pleaded guilty?     And that's why I was interested in the Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of the language in the statute that they used.
10-1219 +++$+++        Do you think -- in terms of the second question on the standard of review, I'm somewhat -- I'd like your response to the approach, that where there's ambiguity -- I mean, you're going to win if there's no ambiguity.     But if there's ambiguity, I think that 1946 makes a difference.     That is, preceding that time, every agency went its own way, and you had dozens of specialized methods of review.     And the whole purpose of 50 years of administrative law has been to try to create uniformity across agencies in a vast Federal Government. And now, what was obviously worrying me in the first case and this case, too --       -- is that we're chipping away at that, and that will be very hard for lawyers and for ordinary people to understand if we suddenly go back and create specialized rules in favor of each agency that always wants a specialized rule, of course; they think what they do is terribly important, which it is, I'm sure. But that's -- that's why I'm saying if ambiguity on the standard of review, you go with uniformity.       That's -- that begs the question in a sense because they're interlinked.     I mean, the same reasons would support that it's not a trial de novo even if you introduce some new evidence.       It is a -- it is an old trial with some new evidence, and there will be a thousand different variations on that theme.       All right.     So, the new part -- I get that.       All right.     Well, if you're willing to accept that, then what about broadening that to prevent people from running around the PTO, and simply saying unless the -- unless the person, the potential patentee, unless he wants to -- unless he has shown he can show that he's innocent, that is to say it wasn't deliberate, it wasn't negligent, it wasn't a part of a trial -- of a strategy, unless he shows he was totally without sin in some form of words in not introducing the evidence the first time, he can't introduce it now?       Well, say that.     Say unless he can show that there was good cause for his not having introduced it before the PTO, he -- the -- the court now won't consider it.       My goodness.     Suppose you're a lawyer, back to the Chief Justice's question, as you are, and you have the client there, and you're thinking, you know, if he puts all his evidence before the PTO, and they say no, we've had it.     I mean, there we are.     But if we hold back something, well, then we're going to get not -- get de novo review and a district court.     Boy!     But if we're too obvious about holding back something, we run into the estoppel rule. My goodness.     You're -- you're in a mess, it seems to me, trying to advise a client what to do in that situation.     Better not say hold something back; on the other hand, if he does he's pretty -- how do you deal -- you see?
10-1259 +++$+++        It's not a violation unless, in addition to a search, it is an unreasonable search.     And since you already -- and the same is true of seizure, isn't it?       So, you already have -- everybody agrees it's at least a search.     So, what do you care whether there's the -- and there's a case called Karo which says whether it's a trespass doesn't really matter.     The question is the reasonableness of it.     And that's what I think -- I mean, you can argue trespass as much as you want, but I'll still have in mind is it reasonable.       And I think that's the question we've been debating.     And I would like to know from you -- what they are saying is that the parade of horribles we can worry with -- worry about when it comes up; the police have many, many people that they suspect of all kinds of things ranging from kidnappings of lost children to terrorism to all kinds of crimes. They're willing to go as far as reasonable suspicion in a pinch.     And they say at least with that, you will avoid the 1984 scenario, and you will in fact allow the police to do their work with doing no more than subjecting the person to really good knowledge of where he's going on the open highway.     Now, I -- they probably put it better than I did, but I'd appreciate your views on that.       And, in fact, those cameras in London actually enabled them, if you watched, I got the impression, to track the bomber who was going to blow up the airport in Glasgow and to stop him before he did.     So, there are many people who will say that that kind of surveillance is worthwhile, and there are others like you who will say, no, that's a bad thing.     But that isn't the issue exactly in front of us.       And what Justice Kagan wanted to know is why not.       Oh, my goodness.     Here, I I can read -- sorry, I just had that expression because I'm reading:     "The existence of a physical trespass is only marginally relevant to the question of whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated, however, for an actual trespass is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation."     That's Karo. So, you can talk if you'd like.     It's your hour.     But I would really be very interested in hearing you on the assumption that the real issue here is whether this is reasonable.       Can you take it to Congress the other way?     I mean, can you say that a general search of this kind is not constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, but should Congress pick out a subset thereof, say, the -- terrorism or where there is reasonable cause or like the FISA court or special courts to issue special kinds of warrants, that that's a different question which we could decide at a later time? That's a negative way of -- I mean, that way favors you in the result, but I've -- I've been looking for -- if there is a way of going to Congress to create the situations where they can do it, rather than the situations where they can't.
10-1261 +++$+++       That's what we said in 24     Merck.    I mean, wasn't Merck just like that?    It says a 25     cause of action can be or whatever -- may not be brought -- may be brought not later than the earlier of 2     2 years after the discovery of the facts or 5 years 3     after the violation.      Because they were both -- 10                 MR. WALL      I'm saying it's something 11     on your side and something the other side.    He's arguing 12     you're wrong because if there's no bad conduct by the 13     defendant, he honestly thinks he doesn't have to file, 14     then the statute never runs.    Okay?      But on the other hand, his 17     position leads to the plaintiff never being able to sue 18     in borderline cases.    Which is worse?      It's worked out, but I 4     don't understand it.    I mean, why not just treat it like 5     a special -- regular statute of limitations?    You say 6     that the profit is made on day one.    It was made by an 7     insider, and if your client finds out about it or 8     reasonably should have found out about it, then the 9     statute begins to run.      Otherwise it's tolled, 12     period.    Simple, same as every other statute.    What's 13     wrong with that?      But there are people, you 19     see, who don't know.    There are always borderline cases. 20     Some people, whether it's this one or not, think maybe 21     they don't have to file.    They think they're outside the 22     statute.    So, they don't.    Okay? You are protected.    If they don't file, and 24     you wouldn't reasonably find out about it, fine.    But 25     when you find out about it or should have, not fine. It's very simple and makes everything logical.    It seems 2     to be fair to your client, certainly.
10-1265 +++$+++       The Ninth Circuit -- I 15     see -- I think I see what they were trying to get at. 16     They want -- they don't see anything practical here to 17     do except to try to get the judge, the district judge, 18     to focus on the question of whether the petition should 19     be amended to assert this kind of claim about the new 20     physical evidence; is that right?      That's where they're trying 23     to go.    Okay.    Now, suppose you lose this case.    Suppose 24     you -- they were to say -- suppose this Court said, 25     well, to tell you the truth, that district judge was operating within his authority in saying that this 2     counsel can continue to represent him.    But we know 3     subsequently relations broke down, and now there is a 4     new counsel.    All right? Can't the new counsel go back to the 6     district court and say, Judge, we'd like to amend the 7     petition so that you will consider, you know, whether it 8     should be amended to include this physical evidence 9     claim?    Couldn't he do that?      So, there's no -- in other 14     words, what the Ninth Circuit in my view is trying to do 15     is they've worked out some complicated way of trying to 16     get the district court to consider the motion about the 17     new physical evidence.      And if that -- if that's 20     right, then unless you -- there's no way to get there. 21     I don't see how you get there under the law.    And so, 22     that's my --      But what do you think?    I'd 25     just like to know what he's --
10-1293 +++$+++        And -- and we're worried about small stations that cannot censor people because they don't know what they're going to say.     All right. That was what we wrote, I think in -- in my opinion, anyway.     We were worried about that.       Are you abandoning that argument?       It's an ABC argument primarily, but you made that argument in the Second Circuit.     What I'm fishing with -- you don't have to comment more, but -- is, do we have to reach that argument?     Except it's --       -- very, very broad --       Yes.       This wasn't -- I mean, I -- don't know about this instance.     It's called "Nude Awakening."     It's about the sexual awakening of a child. You ran it, your client, after 10 o'clock on both coasts, and they choose to run it at 9 o'clock for some unknown reason in the Midwest.     Maybe they thought -- I don't know, whatever.     But the -- (Laughter.)       But -- all right.     So, my point is what the FCC terribly told you to do was run it hour later in the Midwest, just as you did on the coast.       And -- and why is that not -- I'm not saying -- taking this point of view, but I'm saying why isn't that just time, manner, and circumstance that puts you to very little trouble and allows everybody to see it and, therefore, is constitutional?       Because you wanted to make more money from it, I understand that.     And maybe people would have been a little bit inconvenienced, but the inconvenience -- they made a judgment that looking at this show is not like "Private Ryan."     It's about sexual awakening.     They are showing a part of a nude woman. The viewer is supposed to put himself in the position of the boy who's seeing her, and the whole thing was titillating. Now, they might be wrong.     There are two sides to that argument.     And so, I guess what you're arguing is -- if I were to say, is that a reasonable view?     I guess I'd have to say it.     But you have to say much -- you're telling me I have to say much more than that.       All right.       I see where you're going -- the question.       Which -- you haven't seen where I'm going.     I wanted you to say just exactly what you said, and you did, which I thank you.       And -- and my question, which I've been trying to get so you'd see very precisely what it is, is why don't I just say, if you're right, just what you said?     And say this is an instance, case by case, in which, for the reasons, then I quote you, that the First Amendment forbids the application of the guideline to this case.     In other words, what I'm driving at is the basic thing that's worrying me here: Does this case in front of us really call for the earthshaking decision that you all have argued for in the -- in the briefs? And that's what I'm trying to figure out, and that's why I am particularly worried about whether or not this whole big argument here was presented to the FCC about whether we have to reach that far.     Now do you see where I was trying to get?       All right.       My law clerk found 17.       My law clerk found -- sorry.       But your only conclusion from that is that they can't have any rule.       That their -- what is -- I looked through the briefs; I don't see what you're -- tell me where in these briefs do you suggest what the rule ought to be.       Yes.     All right.       Yes.       Where are they in the briefs?     Can you just cite the pages where I will find the alternatives to the present system that don't jump obscenity alone?
10-1320 +++$+++        There is no room in Arkansas law for saying you're acquitted as to one, acquitted as to two.     But Arkansas law says you come in with a verdict of guilty of something, a verdict of acquittal of everything, or the words "hung jury."     Is that right?       No.     They say to the judge, Judge, we are hung.     Judge says "hung jury."
10-1399 +++$+++        What happens -- just for my technical knowledge here.     The -- the employee suffers partial disability on February 1.     He then doesn't notify the employer until, let's say, February 10, and then the employer waits for a week or so, and then begins to pay. Now, is the employer supposed to calculate the -- the weekly wage that he's paying on in the week February 1 to February 10 or -- 3 days, he puts it aside.     But -- in the first week or does he do it on the first week he got notice?     How is that -- how does that work?       That's right.       But I'm saying he has to write the check now.       And the wage could have changed in those few weeks.       The first week he didn't get the notice.     Then the second week he did get the notice.     Which week does he calculate the payment on?       All right.     So, what you're not --       Then we can't -- we cannot read this thing "award" to mean award by the employer. We can't mean it to read "award" by the -- by the government, in your view.     We have to mean it to mean the time that he became entitled to some money.       Yes.       And the tough thing is saying, well, that that's an award.     That's what this case turns on.       And what you pointed to in the statute is you pointed to some situations which say we have situation 3 and 4, and they're not present here; but in situation 3 or 4, award does mean this.       All right.     That's --       You don't have another example of a -- of a situation where "award" did mean -- and so, you're saying there are some others where "award" doesn't mean, okay.     But --       -- is there anything -- what's the most analogous thing you can find anywhere where award has referred to the time a person became entitled to a thing, prior to the time anyone was -- became obliged to give him some money?       Even if that time first was the period for -- way for calculating the money?       910(h)(1).       No, no, don't do it again.       It says was awarded compensation.       Yes, okay.       I mean, you can do it.     You can say it's the time that the statute awards him the compensation.     That's the English language.       But it's the statute that's doing the awarding.       What about the -- the business was newly awarded the tax credit at the time they made the deduction?
10-1472 +++$+++        What do you think on the -- I guess nobody wants to defend this argument, including you, but the First Circuit and several others did look to the provision which permits the taxing of costs for the making of -- it says exemplifications or official documents, for the costs of making copies of any materials obtained for use in the case. Now, if you're going to make a copy for use of the case of something in Japanese, you're going to have to turn it into English.     So, they included that as part of the cost of making copies of the material  of a document for use in the case.     Now -- which is discretionary as to whether you do or whether you don't. But that's how several courts did read it.     I'm just wondering as that didn't strike me as so obviously wrong.     Maybe it's obviously --       I'm sure you'd like to win on any subsection. (Laughter.)       All right.     So, the history is that, prior to '78, a serious number -- some number of circuits said you can get the translation paid for under -- as -- as being necessary to create a copy that's usable in court.     All right.     Then Congress passes this, knowing of those cases in principle.     And then there is a shift after Congress passes this, and then the majority of courts say, all right, this is the provision that permits it.     Is that an accurate statement?       Is there anything in the history of the '78 statute which suggested that Congress didn't want these taxed?       That means you don't have to look at this.       I accept -- I accept the following, that there was a history basically giving -- doing what you want before the statute, but the statute -- nobody thought what it was going to do that history.     That statute is capable of being translated, but it isn't the most natural thing. And so, the question is, do we take -- go with the smaller capability, saying leave -- leave well enough alone, or do we say, gee, that's just too hard to translate it that -- to interpret the statute that way? Have you got any other example in the law? I mean, can you think of an example in the law which I've been trying to think of where there was a history of doing something?     A statute comes along that makes it a little tougher for the judges to do it, and then the Court says either, sorry, too tough now, or it says let sleeping dogs lie.
10-1491 +++$+++        You say there is not a case.     That's a different matter.       Yes, but that's a different matter because you can have a principle that applies even though there isn't a case.     And the principle that here would apply is what I said, Pirates, Incorporated. Do you think in the 18th century if they brought Pirates, Incorporated, and we get all their gold, and Blackbeard gets up and he says, oh, it isn't me; it's the corporation -- do you think that they would have then said:     Oh, I see, it's a corporation.     Good-bye. Go home. (Laughter.)       All right.     Well, what source have you for --       What source have you for that proposition?       You couldn't seize another person other than Blackbeard.     That's why -- if the ship is owned by a corporation, and they sue the corporation in 18 -- 17 whenever it was -- '96 or something, what reason do we have to think that the corporation would have lost -- I mean, would have won?       Well you're right on that point.     What about slavery?     Genocide -- I see your point in the Goldsmith brief.     But what about slavery? That seems like contrary to international law norms, basic law norms, it could be committed by an individual. And why, if it could be committed by an individual, could it not also be committed by a corporation in violation of an international norm?       No, no.     I know, but the way --       I've read the reason why, as you point out in your briefs, the corporations are different in many countries as if they're not moral persons.     And I have in my mind filled in the blanks on that, and I think I know what it refers to.     All right. That's the rationale that kept them out of some of these treaties. And now the question would be, all right, are they always kept out no matter what?     And I'm bringing up the two counterexamples I think were fairly strong, was Pirates, Inc., but that's a joke example, and the other -- although it's a point.     And the other is slavery.     What about -- what about that one?       You could -- you could -- first, maybe you addressed this case.     There was a case called Skinner v. East India Company.       Okay.     All right.     So, it's -- now, what -- what I'm thinking of is if you go through the rationale is you find some instances where individuals could, in fact, violate an international law norm, and then you find a lack of a reason why a corporation couldn't do the same.     Now, in that kind of category, could the Court say we're interpreting Federal common law here to determine who can be sued under this statute?     That's the remedial part.       And we're -- and so, what we're saying is that there is a -- in certain circumstances, there could be a suit against your corporation.     You'd have to be careful because you recognize that by creating a -- a suit against your corporation, you're saying every country in the world can do the same.     And -- and, therefore -- but maybe there are instances of like, universal jurisdiction recognized under international law where you could be pretty certain no harm would be done by that. And so, what I'm thinking of is -- is a way of enforcing it.       No, I see.     Yes.       Well, we know the way to do it.     I mean, in Skinner, even if it was English common law, the court reasons -- it says the taking of the ship on the high seas was "odious and punishable by all laws of God and man."     So, we -- could you not say, where an action is forbidden by the international law, and it is punishable or -- by all laws of God and man, in such a circumstance there being no reason to deny corporate liability here, even under the moral person rule, it -- we interpret the Federal common law to permit that remedy?       You're -- now you're beginning one additional thing, that the corporate rule that you're about to cite shows that many people believe there shouldn't be a remedy against a corporation because they're not moral persons.     Why does it show that the corporation couldn't violate the substantive rule?
10-1542 +++$+++        You had an example in your brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was an example of status rather than intent.     The example that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you can't get it if you were resettled in another country. And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement program.     And then that seemed like a status, a residence.     Were you resettled in the other country or were you not?     That's his status, and then that's imputed to the child.       You're saying -- I just want to hear your whole argument here.     You're saying they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the fact that you were about to say, that domicile necessarily includes residence.     And is there something else?       All right.
10-174 +++$+++        Can the courts set a tax?       Well, I suppose cost-effective -- suppose your complaint is the same but you alleged, what I get from reading these might be the best way to deal with the problem.     I would like the court to impose a tax of $20 a ton on carbon, right? And we bring all the polluters in, and the same injury that you have, everything's the same, you have 14 experts who say this is how to get it done.     It's cost-effective, it will lead to substitution, it will actually bring about a world without global warming, and so let's do it. Now, does the district judge, in your opinion, have the power to enter that order?       All right, now next question is going to be, if he does not have the power to enter that order, which could be proved to be extremely effective, and least possible harm to the consumer, why does he have the power to enter the order you want?       Oh, this will.     This is addressed to that.     It says abate the nuisance, here's how you're going to do it.     You're going to put a $20 a tax ton on carbon, and lo and behold, you will discover that nuisance will be abated.     And we bring in 15 economists.       Well, why is it less intrusive -       -- to try to get into the details of how an electricity company will in fact run its operation, than to say all you have to do is make a change in the dollar sign that you charge for your product?
10-179 +++$+++        Can you go back to that for one second?     I understand the due process issue, which is Brandeis's issue in Crowell.     I think I can -- you're not going to say anything that I can't read in the brief on that.     But the other one is worrying me, the structural issue. So imagine there's no due process concern whatsoever.     Now, when I looked at Crowell, your case would seem to fall right in it.     It is an adjudication under the law as such, you know, between two people - whatever that famous line is.     You're captured by that one.     So the question is:     Can you get out of it with later cases?     And you point to Schor to get out of it. And Schor, as I read it, is an all-factors case, that when she talks in the structural part of - about -- when Justice O'Connor is talking about the non-due process part, the structural part, just what you said, that there isn't a hard-and-fast rule, that there are a bunch of factors that we should look at.     At least that's how I read it.     And you were reading it as a hard-and-fast rule which means you win. Now -- now, who's -- should I just read this case further and make up my mind about that, or is there something you want to say about it?       Well, you know, that's what she says.     And the -- and what you're interested in there, the key thing is not fairness; the key thing is maintaining the integrity of the judicial system.     In Crowell, Justice Hughes says you've made that integrity as long as there were review of matters of fact, the independent decision by a court of questions of law, and reservation to the court of constitutional facts which have never been heard of since.     Okay? So we have this case.     And your issue is, after all, something that for many, many decades or longer has been the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding. The bankruptcy judge is an adjunct to the court.     It is well-established, this kind of review.     Every part of Crowell is met.     So what is -- what is essential to the integrity of the judicial process that requires you to have a de novo hearing before a district court rather than the kind of review that's given here?       In which case?       Well, Marathon, you know, you had four, four and -- and who knows what it stands for.     And then we have a sentence of what it stands for, and if you read that one sentence, I don't think you can say it's a slam-dunk for you.       Of the -- of Marathon and saying, where four and four judges really reject a decision like Crowell, which is a kind of foundation stone?       True, but it's also a -       If -- if we were to decide this case, and suppose we decide every other question and suppose you lost, then wouldn't we send it back for you -- if you're right on that, for the Ninth Circuit to decide about that as an independent basis for no jurisdiction?       I had to make that premise in order to -       If it's that hard, why don't we just DIG the case?     I guess that - (Laughter.)
10-188 +++$+++        So what -- why -- imagine everything here is the same.     That is, what I imagine happened here is that an individual wrote and asked for a FOIA request.     Did Schindler Elevator file a certain kind of statement.     And you say that's not a report. Now, imagine everything the same except the person who asks is called Joe Smith, fraud officer for the agency.     Everything else is the same.     Now is it a report?       All right.       That is exactly what happened here.       No, no, it says, please tell me any documents that they filed that says da, da, da, something like that, okay?     Now, we have the same thing, word for word, except the person who makes the request is not Mrs. Mary Jones from the public, the person who makes the request is the fraud officer for the agency that's worried about being defrauded.     And all I'm interested in is, are they both not reports?     Is one a report and not the other?     Or are they both reports?       I'm just telling you the facts.     The facts are just what I said.       Everything the same except he signs his name, "fraud officer."       All right.     So, then, if a person who is an outside person gets a hold of two documents, one, the request, and two the response, which is to say, yes, I found 15 reports, they're all signed by Mickey Mouse, okay?     And he bases a complaint, there is no such person as Mickey Mouse, it's a fraud, okay? Then you go right ahead and bring the qui tam because it wasn't falling within the exception. Is that right, in the Government's view?       No, no, you're repeating -- I'm trying to show you what the problem is in my mind. I -- I can't quite work out the right definition, and that's what I'm trying to get enlightened on.       I'm not trying to make a difficult question.     All I want is your enlightenment about how when I write these two cases down, should I distinguish them?     Should I say they're both the same or what?       You say in most.     In my circumstance -       In both circumstances.
10-209 +++$+++        It wouldn't be a problem. The problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take it, is what the order would say is that the prosecution has to, for a reasonable time, extend the same offer. And then if it's accepted, you go to the judge.     The judge doesn't have to accept the plea.       You can't make him do that. But I have a bigger problem with this case, which is -- which I may be the only one to have.     But as I've looked at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel within the AEDPA meaning.     That is, you have two courts in the State which have said this is not ineffective. And as I look at it, it's somewhat ambiguous at best. And we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is.     Well, I know both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't make us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in fact it's not. I mean -- so, what am I supposed to do about that?     I find this a tough case.     I've read the record, and in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one else's, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel such that the Sixth Circuit could set that aside -- a contrary finding of the State court. What do I do?       Well, why?     Why?     I mean, why wouldn't the remedy be, as -- judging what you said before, is an order saying to the prosecution re-institute the plea bargain and give him whatever, a week or whatever it is?     Now, we imagine the defendant says I accept.     So, then they go to the judge, just as they would have before.       And the judge has the freedom to accept that or to reject it.       If he rejects it, there is no plea agreement.     Now the defendant must plead.     He can plead guilty or not guilty.     And whatever flows from that, flows from it.       He does.     He does.     His suggestion is perfect, but mine is more perfect. (Laughter.)       You could do it.     You don't have to -- you would -- he's right, you would have to, under my suggestion, have a new trial, even though there was a trial that took place 2 years ago or whatever it is, correct?       But that isn't the end of the argument.       Well, what's wrong -- let me go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I'm trying out what Justice Scalia suggested.     Maybe that does work better.     What -- what you'd say is, first, throw the defendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is there ineffective assistance, but also it would have made a difference; he would have accepted the plea bargain.       So, now they have to hold the plea bargain open.     They then do it.     They then go to the judge, like any plea bargain.     Ninety percent of the time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of it.       But should the judge decide that this is a case where he would reject a plea bargain for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption was wrong, and we reinstate the previous trial.     Now, the -- just say it's over?     You were tried, you were convicted, that's the end of it. Now, what's wrong with that as a remedy?     I mean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the criminal justice system in some way? That's, I think, pretty much what Justice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying that out, because the more I think about it, the more I think maybe that's okay.       Yes, but I --
10-218 +++$+++       Just out of -- I mean, to 15     waste your time for a second, why do the feds own the 16     land underneath the -- and why -- under the nonnavigable 17     parts?    And why do the feds own the land under a 18     nonnavigable stream?      Yes.      I see.    So, the rule is, on 8     the nonnavigable streams, it depends on what the conveyance was at the time of statehood, and those are      -- you'll see the feds own 13     them and sometimes the States.      But, now, Montello was a 7     case -- to follow up this same question.    Montello, I 8     take it, was not a title case.    Montello was a regulation of the stream case.    So, I can understand 10     perfectly well why that language in Montello applies for 11     the reason Justice Kennedy just said.    Now, I grant you 12     that they -- in later title cases, this Court has taken 13     the same words and written them.    But is there an 14     instance in the later title cases where that language 15     has played a controlling role?      What case should I look at 18     to see that it was really meant that that -- this -- 19     see, start where Justice Scalia was and then say what 20     Justice Kennedy just said --      -- and then thinking, 23     well -- I'm thinking, well, Montello was a case that 24     involved a different purpose, and now the later cases, 25     although they quoted the language, it didn't have a role.    Am I right or not?      All right.    So, how do I 11     find that out?    If I start with a practical premise of 12     not wanting to interrupt expectations, I also believe 13     that it's the most common thing in the world for electric power companies to put hydroelectric facilities 15     where there are waterfalls or rapids, and that's true 16     all over the country.    So, what's the status quo with 17     the -- you know, somebody could count up how many 18     hydroelectric plants there are on waterfalls. And what's the general view?    Have those 20     hydroelectric companies been thinking that they are 21     leasing or buying from the feds or from the States?    I 22     mean, I don't know what's happened in the past.    And I 23     have looked at the briefs.    I can't get a very good 24     picture.      When you say "wreak havoc," 9     do you mean to say that the States have leased those 10     strips with the waterfalls which are impassable to 11     hydroelectric companies, and the leases will have to be 12     renegotiated or something like that?
10-224 +++$+++        But in any case, it's -- look, this is a simple question that occurs.     I am an inspector at a federally inspected meat facility.     I look around, and there is a -- a cow and it's lying down.     All right?     It seems to me that your law says I have to go over and see that it is immediately euthanized. Now, how is that not what is forbidden, a requirement -- the exact words are -- "in addition to or different from the Federal requirements governing the operations of that Federal meatpacking facility." The Federal law does not require me immediately to go over and euthanize the cow.     Your law does require me to go over and immediately euthanize the cow.     And, therefore, your law seems an additional requirement in respect to the operations of a -- a federally inspected meatpacking facility.     Now, that seems to me the obvious, simple argument that people have been making, and I would like to know your obvious, simple answer.       It does, you're right. You're right.     I see where you're going.     It says we're talking about regulations that are within the scope of the Act.     But I have assumed that that means we're not talking about airplanes; we're talking about the subject matter of the Act.     And so, is this the kind of regulation that is within the subject matter of the Act? And it seems to be.     It has to do with how you slaughter animals.     It has to -- I mean, if you're going to be so specific as you say the only things that are within the scope of the Act are the specific requirements that are there already in the Federal Act, then this prohibition against extra regulations means nothing. I mean, it can't mean that.     So, it just means the subject matter.     And now, if it means the subject matter, then why don't you lose?       What do you mean, instead of?     What is the scope of the Act?     Are you saying the scope of the Act refers only to those particular provisions that are already in the Act, requirements already there?       Yes?     Then why did they put in something saying you can't add anything?       I -- I didn't see your argument, and now I see it.     Okay.     So, I understand where you're going. But then if I look at section 610 of the Act, it has a whole bunch of prohibitions, including prohibitions and references to how you slaughter animals, and including how you slaughter animals humanely.     So, there, how do you say that this provision which talks about euthanizing an animal that you look around and it's lying down -- how is that not within the scope of the Act?     I'm not saying that they have that particular thing, but the subject matter, slaughtering animals, indeed humanely, is something the Act absolutely deals with.       No, I didn't say that.     I said yes, it's part of the operations, but also it's the subject matter with which the Act deals.     The Act deals with the humane slaughter of animals and other forms of slaughter of animals.     So, how -- how is -- so, I repeat my question.       Okay.     I see.     That's what you said before --
10-235 +++$+++        As I read the statute -- as I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in Rogers, that the negligence has to play a part in producing, and in the snake case the negligence doesn't matter.     It's simply the timing, et cetera.     And is - that's how I read it.       And I guess that's how courts have read it.     I'm not sure; you know.     And I suspect from the answers I've gotten so far there's never been a court that read it differently.       I don't know if they said this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was negligent played a part, of course; it was "but for"; but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant, because it's not within the risk in any sense whatsoever. Now as I -- you know the area.     I don't put -- don't just agree with me because I'm saying it.     Is that roughly the -
10-238 +++$+++        And what about -- it's a general question.     Answer this if you wish.     Don't if you don't want to, and the same goes for your opponent. But as I hear this argument, what's going through my mind is we are deeply into the details of a very complex bill.     MCCain-Feingold is hundreds of pages, and we cannot possibly test each provision which is related to the others on such a test of whether it equalizes or incentivizes or some other thing, because the answer is normally we don't know. And it is better to say it's all illegal than to subject these things to death by a thousand cuts, because we don't know what will happen when we start tinkering with one provision rather than another. That thought went through my mind as I've heard this discussion.     Comment or not upon it as you wish. (Laughter.)
10-277 +++$+++        Is the -- is the common question of law or fact whether, given the training which central management knew -       -- given the facts about what people say and how they behave, many of which central management knew, and given the results which central management knew or should have known, should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?       If that is a fair way to put it, is that a question that every one of the women in this class shares in common?
10-290 +++$+++        All those first principles are along the lines of how important patents are and what a disaster is it is to the person once they're invalidated.     Okay.     I think the other side will say: In today's world, where nobody really understands this technology very well, a worse disaster for the country is to have protection given to things that don't deserve it because they act as a block on trade, they act as monopolies, and they will tie the country up in individual monopolies that will raise prices to consumers, et cetera.     You can imagine my spelling out this argument.       So I can't work out in my own mind whether in today's world these first principles cut for the patentee or cut for the challenger to the patent.       And the first are not?
10-313 +++$+++        I don't -- what I -- there's no way for you all to go to the FCC and decide what part of this thing is -- or any State regulator, what part of it is -- part of what's necessary to facilitate interconnection and what part of it is really providing the work primarily of the -- simply transporting services?       What part is doing something else?       There's no way to do that?       Okay, so a judge has to say, on the basis of what, on the basis -- the judge has to say on the basis of the statute, which just uses the word "interconnection"?       Yes.     But the -- the --       It doesn't help because it's a network element if it's in (3), and what this is, is something that's going to be needed to -- to interconnect.     If it's -- if it's in -- if it's in the first one.     And I don't know which is which, and I gather that sometimes it would be tough.     And what courts use to do with the ICC when they got into this kind of situation is a doctrine called primary jurisdiction, and they'd ask them for a brief.     All right?     So, if that's what we've done hypothetically, we have the brief.       Now, why don't we have to follow the brief?       That's not what the statute says.     The statute says the carriers have a duty to provide interconnection.       Now, in carrying out a duty to provide, you say that's just picking a point. Somebody could equally well say, no, it's a duty to provide means to get to the point.     Now, either of those seem equally consistent with the language.       Yes.       No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say the opposite.     And, therefore, you might have an agency reasonably deciding that to provide -- to fulfill that duty, you must provide equipment reasonably necessary to allow the competitor to connect. That's equally sensible.       Yes.       Apparently, you have an agency that never really said one way or the other.       I don't see what the other -- I didn't hear anything that said they said the other.     They've said when you have wires and you're using the wires for communication, then they don't fall outside this; that's true.     But if you're using them for interconnection, and they're necessary to use for interconnection, maybe it does fall inside this.     I don't --       Excluded -- they excluded transport -- all transport to the point of interconnection, where you could not provide the facility to interconnect unless you had the transport? Is that what they did?       Did they do that?     Yes or no?     I bet the answer is no.       All right.       But there are -- there are cases, I think, in primary jurisdiction where what a district court has done, anyway, is to hold the case while the ICC went and had a proceeding.     And I'm sure that hasn't been used in a long time.       It is?       Well, maybe this is the case for it.       It all didn't matter because, in fact, they got the TELRIC rates under (c)(3) until they changed the impairment part?       So, who cared?     And now after that, they care.       And now -- now -- now the other side cares, of course.     And so, now -- now we're faced with a situation where they're just putting this in the brief for the first time, but they can't base it on anything the commission actually did?       Amd I'm glad it's right because I don't know what I'm talking about. (Laughter.)
10-382 +++$+++        I have a question on that particular point, and there may be an obvious answer to this which I just couldn't find.     But if the lawyer is in the government and he writes a memo, then -- and if it's available to a litigant who litigates against the government, as it would be here, then why isn't it available to the entire world via the Freedom of Information Act?       That's certainly true, they're not.     But I just wonder, what is it in FOIA that would make this not available to the world?       Well, that just -- that just says it may or may not be coextensive.     Reading the statute, it says you have to make all inter- agency or all memos available of a certain type, which I think this would fall into.     Then exception 5 protects, among other things, attorney-client memos that are privileged because they're inter-agency or intra-agency memos that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation.       Now, they are available if you win.     And so, if you win that exception doesn't seem to apply.     And if it doesn't seem to apply, that's what was -- then the whole world can get this memo.     And what I'm wondering is there must -- either there is a very obvious answer to that, which there could be, or there isn't.     If there is an obvious answer, that's the end of it.       If there isn't an obvious answer, I'll have to go away and worry about it.       I know you don't want that, and what I'm looking is how you prevent that.       Does that happen a lot?     I mean, I -- I -- I'm not -- does that happen a lot?     I mean, are there a lot of instances where the lawyers who work for all -- the retirement funds are huge.     There must be cases coming up all the time.     And all the advice of the lawyers is just available -       I know that.     I'm just worried about the -- the attorney-client privilege is somewhat sacred, and suddenly making everything available to the whole public has got me worried.     And I looked at that Sears case.     I didn't see anything there that eases my concern.     And then you referred to a different case, the name of which I forgot, and I could not find.       Is that in the -       How am I going to find it? I couldn't get how you spell it.
10-444 +++$+++        Yes, but what about as a constitutional violation that, in a context of a world where 95 percent of all people in prison are there as a result of bargaining and guilty pleas arranged with prosecutors -- in that context, it's fundamentally unfair to deprive a person of his liberty for 40 years instead of 6 months because the lawyer which he is guaranteed fell down on the basic, fundamental, obvious duty of communicating the relevant plea agreement?       So, is there any support for me? (Laughter.)       But, now, you've read these cases, and now we're right on what I think is the point, because we've both defined a possible constitutional right, but there's a practical problem.     All right? Now, the States and others have dealt with this on your side --       -- for the last 30 years. And, presumably, you, but not me, have read a lot more cases. Now, have they developed -- as you look across those cases, are there some States or places that have developed reasonably tough standards in respect to what counts as ineffective assistance and in respect to whether it made a difference that would help to alleviate the concern that this would turn into a great mess?     Which it hasn't, apparently.       Why?     Because you have to show a causal connection.     So, you'd have to show -- show in the causal connection that he would have taken that deal.       And if -- if you're going to use the words "reasonable probability" that he would have taken it, it might be fairly easy to show.     And that's where in the back of my mind I'm thinking that maybe we want something tougher than reasonable probability, that you have to show that it really would have made a difference.
10-507 +++$+++        I think the question is, is there any difference between the two?       Well, why wouldn't they have been -- I mean, as I understand it, if a person of a certain set -- and it's the same set in both, virtually, the same set of people -- where they're injured on navigable waters or piers and docks and so forth, it's the Longshore Act.     And if you're on the platform, it's this Act, so far.     And the benefits are the same.       Okay.     So, the only thing that extending this does, I think he says, is imagine a person who worked on a platform goes to get some platform bits repaired miles from the sea.     Now, that person would not be covered by Longshore Act, would he?       No.     And he would be covered by this, if they're right, but not if Clement is right.       Okay.     So, he's saying what point was there for Congress to do that?       Let me give you an example. It might help.     A longshoreman is working on a dock. Someone tells him:     There is a winch here that's broken; take it to the plant to have it repaired, which is 100 miles inland.     He does it, and he's hurt at the plant.     He is not covered, correct?       Correct.     Yes, that's right.     So, he's not covered.       But if the same thing happens on the platform, under your theory he is covered.     Now, your opponent is asking a reasonable question.     That seems to be about the only difference that he can think of, whether it's the one Act or the other, and why would Congress have done that?     That's his question, and I'd like to hear the answer.       So, your answer is basically there are many statutes like this, they all have some kind of OCSLA-type requirement, it's the Longshore Act that was rather stingy, and we don't know why.       Why?       Because of the workmen's compensation?       Does it carry over who's an employee from the Longshoreman Act?     Which defines an employee as a maritime worker, and then defines that and has exceptions and so forth, and this has a couple more. That's who the employee is; is that right?
10-5258 +++$+++  
10-5400 +++$+++        Well, the Senate report says that the provisions we've been talking about make clear a defendant should not be sent to prison only because the prison has a program that might be good for him.     Drug dependence in the committee's view generally should not play a role in the decision whether or not to incarcerate the offender.     Is there something that conflicts with that? Because that was pretty clear indication of the committee's view.       You put a great deal of weight on the word only.     I guess if it's a dual motive we don't really know what would have happened in the absence of one of the motives.     So should we send the whole thing back for resentencing?
10-5443 +++$+++        Okay, where do we get this -       I do have a question I would like to ask at some point.     Are you finished?       Because this is very interesting.     I normally think purpose is important.     In this one I don't, and suppose I'm right, purpose has nothing to do with this.     The problem here is with the words "intent" and "prevent."       Now, if that's the problem, if that's the problem, the words that capture that problem, are their words "realistic likelihood," not the words "possibility."     So if I have to choose between those two, and that is the problem, why don't I choose their solution?       All right.       They use realistic likelihood and if someone were to tell me in my odd example there is no realistic likelihood he would go to a Lithuanian movie, that seems to describe perfectly whether I would or would not say in trying to prevent him from going to the movies, you try to prevent him from going to a Lithuanian movie.     And your -- yours doesn't -- I mean it's a -- I agree it may not make that much difference, but we have to choose some form of words.       No, it wouldn't have been okay, but you don't normally say of a person when a thing is really weird, but he wants it to happen that doesn't do it for that -- it's so unlikely.     I shoot an arrow into the air hoping it will fall on my enemy.     All right?     It's not going to.     But if it does, we say he intended it.     You see, that -- that's the kind of linguistic problem that I think is present.       It's not awkwardly constructed.     It's trying to get odd possibilities, and if it is trying to get those odd possibilities about which we normally would say he did intend to prevent that from happening, then those things we're trying to leave out are those where there is no realistic possibility that they would happen.       Then let's take their words.       I think the question was.
10-545 +++$+++        No, but it was -- in Eldred the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new book.     And in this case, by definition, there is no benefit given to anything at all that is not already created.       By -- how?     How does it give any benefit to anything that isn't already created?       How does this provision do that?     I think maybe there are other provisions, but I thought this provision is talking solely about books, for example, that are already created.       Is it not?     I may have been misreading, it but I certainly got that out of, like, 42 briefs and -- (Laughter.)       Oh, oh.     You say --       Well then, you know, as you also know from the 42 briefs, that there's a lot of argument that you could comply in other ways that are less restrictive.     And whether that's true or not, is that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it, it's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what you're saying is we are -- here have a law which says that libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either pay more money for things already in existence or will simply be unable to get them if they're orphans, on the one hand, so that other countries will impose similar kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our works that are already in -- that are already produced, or simply can't use them because they can't find who owns them. Now, that's in parody form, for succinctness, what I think the argument is on the other side --       -- and they'll say no copyright law -- with your exception of when the country was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of purpose.     That's served often by tariffs --       -- but not by copyright law.       Not necessarily.     There are three categories.     One is the category of the people who you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I think, and Russia.     The second is the category of the people -- of sound recordings, and their third is the category, which is not the null set, of people who did not comply with certain registration requirements.     For example, I believe that the widow of Samuel Brittan failed to renew her copyright.     And there are probably many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years, and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't think there was much money in it.     And those are the very works that the libraries want to get ahold of and put in their databases.       That's true but for one text.     They say that text has to do with progress.     And when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in light of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to letters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has always meant produce at least one new thing.     And here there is not one new thing.       All right.       It couldn't have been. That must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?     Because the only concern is not about protecting new works in the foreign countries.     The concern, as I understand it, was that we've had things in copyright for many years, and we want retroactive protection there.     The countries that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of the Berne Convention. Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many years, and I guess somebody might pursue us.     And then you get into an argument about whether there are other ways.     Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these briefs are full of? I'll give you an example.     Save The Music is charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods '30s, '40s, and '50s.     Other organizations might find a treasure trove of literature that was -- that was copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they want to put it on the Web, and they want people to listen to it.     But they have no more idea of how to track down the person on that, and they aren't protected by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance parties. We're told by Barbara Ringer, former registrar, that there are millions of such instances where people would like to go back and would like to put music, literature, film, et cetera, in a form that people can use it today, and there's no way to do it without their becoming scofflaws or without their having millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers and lawyers.     Now, that's the argument that's made on the other side, as the interest in communication that's important. What do you say?       Well, here we have ASCAP. We have ASCAP.     I agree with you that it is a general problem.     It may be diminished in the United States, but it still exists.     And I guess the argument here is, well, don't make it millions of times worse.       Well, what do you -- Barbara Ringer said a million.     She numbers it in the millions.     Do you want to say, too?
10-553 +++$+++        Suppose that's the central tenet.     Suppose you have a religion and the central tenet is:     You have a problem with what we do, go to the synod; don't go to court.     And that applies to civil actions of all kinds.     All right?     So, would that not be protected by the First Amendment?       Your view is it's not protected?       So that, in fact, if they want to choose to the priest, you could go to the Catholic Church and say they have to be women.     I mean, you couldn't say that.     That's obvious.     So, how are you distinguishing this?       You're saying that going to church -- sorry -- that going to court is a more fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that she wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic priest.     But that's the distinction you're making.       Well, why?     I don't know why that doesn't -- I mean, you may be right, but it isn't obvious to me that the one is the more important than the other.       Yes, but then you have to say that it's more important to let people go to court to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman to get a job.     I can't say that one way or the other. So -- so, I'm stuck. And since I'm really -- this is tough and I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going into religion to some degree.     You have to decide if this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of minister.     That gets you right involved.     Or if you're not going to do that, you're going to go look to see what are their religious tenets?     And that gets you right involved. I just can't see a way of getting out of something -- of getting out of the whole thing.     I don't see how to do it.     So, suppose you said in case of doubt like that, we'll try what Congress suggested.     And now we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the heartland case.     So, you say, all right, where you have a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away, and what Congress said is okay.     So, now what you have to prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to show that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever, because she didn't conform to the religious tenets.     All right?     That's what they have to show. And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't show that there was at least some evidence to that effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing. Now -- now, I see that's an interference, but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace or the other.     Otherwise, you're going to get into who is a minister. So, what's the answer to this dilemma?     At the moment I'm making an argument for following what Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody ever thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me, they didn't read it, then she's going to win.     And if they come in and show that they really did this because of their religious tenet, they'll win.     What about that?       Well, it does have the virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough constitutional question.     And I agree, with what we sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was the basic rule.       No, but that isn't -- but that isn't the problem.     The problem, it seems to me, is I don't know how substantial these interests are religiously.     I don't know how substantial the religion itself considers what they do from a religious perspective. So, let's go back to Justice Alito's problem.     And now on the ministerial issue, we call the synods, we call the how certain was it, how central is it to the heart of the religion, what they're actually doing, and we replicate exactly what he said, in respect to the problem of religious tenet, now in respect to the problem of religious minister. And maybe you can tell me we don't have to go into the one or the other, but I've had enough of these cases in the lower court to know they are really hard.     People believe really different things, and I see no way to avoid going into one or the other, and, therefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional matter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.       Now, what do you -- that's --       That's the state of the argument that you're walking into, I think.       No.     I don't agree with that.     I think -- I think what it says is a religious organization may require that all applicants and employees conform to the religious tenets.     It put that in the section defining defenses.     The defenses are part of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says forbids retaliation against an individual for the exercise of any right granted. And, therefore, I don't believe that a person who has failed to violate the substantive section could be held up normally. I mean, I don't --       I can think it's pretty easy to read that exception, even though it's in a different subchapter, into the retaliation exception. And assume for me that that's so.
10-568 +++$+++        So why -- I mean, what the commission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal friend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the years.     So that doesn't sound like any volunteer.     It sounds like somebody sitting on a case where his best friend is likely to gain millions of dollars.       That's what it seems when I read that opinion, that they're thinking all these things combined is what causes this to fall within the category of a reasonable person might have doubts about the independence of judgment.       Yes.       That's part of it.     But my -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges, and I guess you have a very vague statute which was quoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules with ethics commissioners.     I have in my office - they're not commissioners; they're committees of judges. And I have in my office seven volumes which I look at when there's a question, as others do, and those seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a committee trying to apply vague statutes and vague rules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally. So what's wrong with Nevada doing exactly the same thing here?       Oh, so you're saying that the difference is that we're judges?       You mean Congress and legislators and Executive Branch people couldn't have exactly the same system?       And they have general rules?     It's called the common law system.       You didn't answer my question, which is since the Judiciary uses what's called the common law method, why is it impermissible for the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch also to use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating through example what a general -- what a general provision means?       Well, I -- so you're saying that one who engages has to use a -- a definitive rule-based method rather than a common law method?     So my question there would be, assuming your difference between the branches is right, still why?
10-577 +++$+++        But what about -- what about -- suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201. Suppose we only had 7206, and the question before us was, does 7206 fit within the term "aggravated felony"; i.e., does it involve fraud or deceit? So, we read 7206; it doesn't say anything about fraud or deceit.     It says perjury and making a false statement.     So, then we go look up what were the torts of fraud and deceit.     And he's right.     Fraud traditionally requires an intent to get another person to act, but you don't have to have that intent to violate 7206.     And deceit -- it not only involves that; it also involves the person having acted. So, the traditional tort of deceit, you have to intend the acts, and he actually has to have acted to his detriment.     Fraud, you have the first of those and second.     You read the statute and say, well, say neither of those is present here.     This is just perjury, which isn't good, but it's not fraud or deceit.     And there we are, not in the statute.     What's the answer to that?       No, no, not always.     But here we were dealing with a very serious statute, aggravated felonies.     That has terrible consequences for the persons who fall within it.       So -- and in most of these M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to statutes by number so most of it, though not all of it, is very specific.     So, when we read these words "fraud" and "deceit" here, why don't we say fraud and deceit means fraud and deceit?       The traditional elements.       No, no, no.       You have to prove that the -- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment.       Which he may or may not have done.     I mean, when you commit -- a person who commits perjury may or may not have intended that a victim rely to his detriment.     Which you don't have to prove here.       Deceit can mean that. You're absolutely right.       No, the tort didn't involve that.     The tort involved the same element of fraud which you don't want to rely on.       Is there any -- is there any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument other than that you just think that and you could argue the other way?     I mean, can we get anywhere?       Let me go up to start with Justice Ginsburg's first question.     I mean, if this falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury? Is every perjury statute within it?     And what about lying to an FBI agent?     And what about lying to a government official, which is -- which is -- you know, there are all kinds of statutes on that one.       Are all those aggravated felonies?       Yes, yes.       The government's view is that, of course, you have to meet the other requirements.     But as far as the words "fraud" or "deceit" is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI agent, lying to this or lying to that.     And has that been the consistent policy of the immigration service? Have they deported people where the other two conditions are fulfilled?       But all I need are a few. I mean, I just wonder, is it the policy of the INS and the government to deport people where these other things are met -- which they would be perhaps rarely; I don't know -- but to deport them where the crime, the underlying crime, is perjury, lying to an FBI agent or lying to other government officials?
10-6 +++$+++        How do you say, I am not certain that willful blindness would support the conclusion below.     The standard, the district court or the trial court said really, negligence, as I read it. The circuit said deliberate disregard of a known risk. Well, how much of a risk?     I mean, the business world there is always a risk and we are talking about a complicated world, probably quite a lot of risk.     And so I think that standard would create a great deal of uncertainty.     Willful blindness has a tradition.     So are you okay with willful blindness and we say we are afraid they did not do it, i.e., we are afraid, we do not know what they really meant here and so send it back and do it again.     I am sure you wouldn't be overjoyed.     But do you think that would be a reasonable result?       What are you supposed to say known risk, sure he says he looked at five.     And he says anybody can figure this thing out, all you do is put the little gizmos between the two sides, you know, and you have an inside and outside and you just suspend the inside with little bars of some kind.     I do not know what, chewing gum or something, and he says anybody could figure that out, it couldn't possibly be bad.     And so that is their view, but how much of a risk, they will say little risk, big risk.     So you see why I think we should send it back.     Now you tell me why that is not -       I am not saying they are right in that, I bet they would lose.     But my problem is do I accept the words deliberate disregard of the known risk or do I say the more traditional accompaniment to knowledge is willful blindness, which for all its obscurity, at least has a history.       I don't think that is the part they are complaining about.       The difference, they say, between (b) and (c) is that (c) applies to a person who makes some really special thing that looks like a Japanese kabuki theater costume, and it's actually made out of metal and it's really -- has a very bizarre thing, and it is only used -- good use is to do this infringing thing. But (b) could apply to somebody who makes plastic shields.     (B) can apply that -- (b) could apply to anybody who makes anything; is that right?       Well, the argument is that the words "actively induced" are meant to be something greater than knowing, not something less than knowing. Because otherwise, you're going to hold Aluminum Company of America, if that still exists, liable when it makes these aluminum sheets, because somebody uses an aluminum sheet apparently, et cetera.     You see the problem. It is quite different when you make this weird kabuki-looking thing that only has one use, and they -- and that's why it should be -- it should be harder to hold that person to contributory infringement, not easier. Now, that's their argument.     What do you say.       I'd like to get, really, an answer from you on Justice Kennedy's question, because at the moment I am not worried about your case.     You, of course, are.     I understand that. But the -- I am worried about Alcoa or the little backyard maker of clay pots, or -- I mean, millions and millions of people make things that are used in millions and millions of ways.     And I am worried about what kind of burden we are supposed to impose on them. I see three candidates.     One is, you're liable if you should have known.     Two is, you're liable if you consciously disregarded a -- a risk, a known risk; that is sort of like a -- you know, the Model Penal Code, sort of.     And third is willful blindness. Is there a fourth?     And if there is not, what do you choose among those three?     No, not what you choose.     What should we choose?       So is that -- is that another standard?     Maybe that is an example of what it is to be willfully blind.     If, in fact, you go out and you copy something, it could well be patented, and you do not tell your lawyer, go look up this one, that is willfully blind.       That is why you say they are the same.     I don't want to put words in your mouth.       That is where I am.     At the moment, the should have known or willful blindness, the disregard -- the problem, and it seems like a real problem, is know what, exactly?     Well, know there is a risk.     Well, at that point half the country in the business world is very upset because there is always a risk.       And the other problem is if you -- as you move away from that and say, no, no, I mean a real risk -- I mean a huge risk -- I mean a risk that in fact, you almost knew that this was it -- now I can do it with my tone of voice, but I need the words to put in there that are going to calm people's fears that they are not suddenly going to be held liable because there is some fairly small risk of this.     So what words would I use?       I know this case; I am not worried about.     I am worried about what I said.       The reason we took the case is because there seemed a bunch of standards floating around.     Now I know our interests differ in this matter, but I would appreciate any help you can give me about what I am thinking now is words that will quantify the risk that you had to have known about, a risk; so that it doesn't look like some small thing that is always there that looks like some giant thing that is pretty close to actually -       Well, I've heard about that.       Yes, it would.       -- my problem, is a high probability that.     You have to be -- you have to consciously, that is the model penal code, that is the -- you know, torts -- you have to consciously disregard a high probability that this item was patented and also meet the other requirements that are part of active inducement.     That is what your thought is?       I know your client doesn't care.     But still we have to write this.     So what about the answer? To follow it up a little bit, it is knowledge -- you're familiar with these areas, so you're helpful, and -- and it is a knowledge or a known -- or consciously disregarding a known risk where the risk consists of a high probability that that item that you are inducing to be produced will infringe a patent.
10-63 +++$+++        Is it -- is it -- I'm still unclear on one factual thing.     Did the State's attorneys know that the letters had come back?       Should they have known?       Do they check the -- do they check the docket every so often to see what's happened?       Why did --       All right.     If we have to send it back, I guess we'd have to say what the rule is. So, what -- what is the rule?     What about a rule that says, where in fact attorneys do abandon the client and the local attorney does as a matter of practice in the State do virtually nothing except to facilitate foreign representation, and where the State had cause to believe -- cause to believe -- that all that was true, then the State cannot assert this as an adequate ground. That's all.       Because?       Irrespective of what the rules were, you'd have to show -- he would have to show that, in fact, in the State it is a practice such that the local counsel doesn't do much of anything except facilitate, because this is a state of mind as to whether the State -- and the State knows that. If he shows both of those things and shows that the letter came back and shows this was abandonment or close thereto, then the State ought to know that this individual has no idea about filing a piece of paper and thinks somebody else is doing it.     And that's enough to say this is not adequate State ground that would block Federal habeas.     Now, your argument against that is what?       It seems in the briefs -- there's certainly a lot in the briefs that seemed to say that.
10-637 +++$+++        How does that happen if -- let's imagine Smith is convicted of some kind of disorderly conduct, and he goes through the State courts and it's upheld.     And then at some time thereafter -- I leave vague how -- how much time.     Maybe it's a couple of months or something.     The Supreme Court says that particular kind of conduct is protected by the First Amendment.     So, now it falls within the exception for you can't criminalize this. Now, habeas is filed.     Smith files habeas. Well, how can he get that heard?     Because this particular provision says that unless it was clear at the time under, in your view, of the State statute -- the final State decision on the matter, he can't get into habeas.     Now, it wasn't clear.       He goes to State court under a collateral review.       Suppose there is no such --       So this is quite far out, but conceivable.     You'd argue that in the State court, the State -- you'd have to go to collateral review in State court and argue that they now have to apply the new rule.
10-6549 +++$+++        So, why -       So -       Leaving the language aside, I'd like to go back to what Justice Sotomayor was asking.     We are talking, it seems to me, about section 2250.     He was convicted of violating, criminally, that section.     So, I have no problem about the statute applying to all these people; it's a question of how it applies. All right.     Imagine with me that we have an individual who was convicted a year ago and sentenced to a 5-year term.     Does the statute apply to him?       Yes, correct.       Yes, correct.       Of course, it does.     Of course, it does. Now, he hasn't registered yet.     He's in jail for 4 more years.     So, has he violated 2250 so far?       Not?     Thank you. So, a person who has recently -- recently - committed the crime, is in prison, is under an obligation to register, is yet not in violation because the time for initially registration -- registering has not yet expired.     Now let's go back to a person who is far less certain how it applies.     He committed the crime or 15 years ago.     He has long since been released from prison. There are, as you point out, several categories.     One is a person who has to -- who should, under Michigan State law, register, but he didn't. Another is a person who did and moved.     You know, there are several categories. Now, is he in violation of 2250?     Your point is he is immediately, even though it was much less clear that it applied to him, much less clear.     And much less clear -- in fact, it doesn't say when he is supposed to register, but still 2250 applies to him. I just wonder how that could be, particularly when we have three sentences, indeed, which seem to me to tell the Attorney General, certainly, please deal with that kind of a case.       I thought he was convicted of a crime.       I thought he was convicted of a crime under 2250.     That's why I asked the question. And his lawyer said, in response to my question, that one of the things she wants to argue is that he cannot be convicted under 2250 until he is under a legal obligation to register, and that initial registration is not a legal obligation until the Attorney General makes his rules.     I thought that was the argument.       So, subsection (c) says he has to, not later than 3 days -       In other words, you're reading (c) as saying, to go back to my example, the person who was convicted last year and has 4 more years to do his initial registration -- nonetheless, if he changes his name, if he stops being a student while in prison, he has to register tomorrow or the day after. I would say if that's your reading of those two sections, it's -- it's going to confuse everybody who is in prison, as it did confuse me.       All right.     Then I take it your reading is he does not have to fulfill (c) until after he has to have initially registered.     And so, we're back to the question of why you treat somebody who committed the crime long ago with less clarity, with less time to initially register, with more confusion from one jurisdiction than another, than you would treat a person who was convicted last year, is still in jail, and has 4 more years to register.     That's why I read (d) as trying to sort that kind of thing out.       I see.     Your view is that they have to register initially when?       No, no, I'm just saying take my example.     The person is in Michigan.     Michigan does have a sex registration thing, but he never actually did it.     So, now this Federal Act comes in, and now when is he supposed to register?     When's his initial registration?       Oh, reasonable time.       And what is a reasonable time?       In 3 business days, he's supposed to go out and do that, and if he doesn't do it, he has committed a Federal crime which makes no mention of it, no mention at all, and he's just supposed to guess that that's 3 business days because he's a lawyer; is that why?
10-680 +++$+++ 
10-694 +++$+++        That's true, but -- but it may save a little time at least if -- we're in an arcane area of the law, to me.     It was created by Robert Jackson, Attorney General, and by Thornburgh, Attorney General.     And if we're starting with that, what that says is we have a list over here of excludable things, and we have a list of deportable things.     And if you're deported for a reason that shows up on that first list, than the AG could waive it.     That's basically the outline I have.     And also I have, which isn't quite right, that in that first list there's something called -- big letters -- CIMT or something, crime of moral turpitude.     And all the things on this second list, the big issue is, is it a crime of moral turpitude? And, as I looked through the opinions, this is what I got out of them.     And This is tentative.     I got out, just as you say, there are two things in the second list which are not crimes of moral turpitude. They consist of illegal entry crimes and gun crimes. And there are special reasons for the first, and the second is debatable; but they've been consistent with that. Then there are things that are on both lists, they are a crime of moral turpitude.     I counted at least eight cases saying, for example, rape, burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery, indecency with a child, and probably some others are all crimes of moral turpitude.     So, it clicks in, okay? Then I find Blake, and Blake says sexual abuse of a minor is not a crime of moral turpitude. That's a little surprising.     But it gives us a reason: Because -- and this was the problem here.     It talks about there has to be substantial -- there has to be similar language in the two lists.     I don't know where that one came from.     It had certainly not been in the earlier cases. And now we have this case, which is voluntary manslaughter.     I would have thought that voluntary manslaughter is right at the heart of the lists that they said the things are crimes of moral turpitude, and not like visa crimes or gun crimes, if I had read the cases. So, where do I end up?     Well, what I end up with this, and this is what I would like you to reply to.     Justice Brandies once said something like we have to know before we can say whether an agency opinion is right or wrong, what they're talking about.     I felt perplexity after I had read through these decisions.     In other words, I don't understand it. So, I would like you to explain to me why this all fits together and how, if you can do that. I couldn't get that clear explanation from the brief, and I suspect it is not your fault.       Yes, yes.     The one that was worrying me:     rape, burglary, manslaughter, second-degree robbery, indecency with a -       All those cases -- there are about seven or eight of them.       Don't look to the conviction.     That may be his approach.     My approach is look to the category.       Look to the category.     And the category here is not -- you know, the category isn't crime; the category is what kind of a crime.     And this is a crime of violence.     In the statute, or if you look at what was charged, it's called voluntary manslaughter. Either way, I would think those categories as categories fall within "crime of moral turpitude."       Thank you.       Can we go back to second on this very interesting -- suppose I say, okay, I concede.     I'd only do it for the sake of this question. You're absolutely right in your categorization.     The right category is crime of violence.     And then I look at the statute, which is 8 U.S.C. 1101(43), which you probably know by heart, and I look at the definition of gun crimes, and I look at crime of violence. My non-schooled reaction is, well, gun crimes, I can see why they said that wasn't really a crime of moral turpitude, because there are a lot of registration requirements, there are all kinds of different things that drug -- gun dealers have to do, and you could commit that crime in various ways that don't involve moral turpitude.     I can understand that, sort of.     At least, I could see how somebody else might have understood it that way. Now, I think crimes of violence, I say, hey, I am having trouble here.     Why don't you try to list a few crimes of violence that when they come into the country you're going to say, oh, that wasn't a crime of moral turpitude?     And by the way, I am not asking you to list specific examples; I am asking you to list categories.     List categories of crimes of violence that when the person comes in, you're going to say, hmm, no moral turpitude there.       That's not a crime of - that's not a moral turpitude, simple assault?     You're going to just hit somebody?       Burglary -- isn't burglary where it might be an occupied building?       Well, no, no.     A warehouse. I am being a little quibbling now.     Of course, my basic concern -       Oh, really?     Okay.       So, there are some.     There are some.       This is a little odd, but what I'm afraid of -       Okay.     What I'm afraid of is this:     That once you put this in your category, that you say crimes of violence are not crimes of moral turpitude, then to a large extent you have said good-bye, Justice or Attorney General Robert Jackson.       You're saying good-bye to Jackson and Thornburgh, because you have driven such a wedge between these two statutes that there's hardly anybody who would be able to qualify for the Jackson- Thornburgh approach to this statute.       I overstate slightly, but you see my point.       You're also telling me that -- I didn't know this; I learn something in every argument -- that if we have Jack the cat burglar who was burgling dozens of office buildings -- and abroad -- and assaults people and hits them over the head or whatever with his -- I guess with his fists, that we have no way of excluding that person, should he try -- I've heard criticisms of our immigration policy, but this seems surprising to me, that we have no way of excluding that person who is filled with simple burglary of office buildings and assaults.       All right.     He has only done it once; we have to let him in.       I take it they haven't decided.     So -
10-699 +++$+++        What are then the reasons that -- because your friend says that this is an a fortiori case from everything, because all of these words -- every time the word "exclusive power" has appeared in any source -- I think that's what you're saying -- it is meant that the President can act without supporting authority from Congress.     But there never has been a case or a suggestion that the President can act where Congress has legislated to the contrary.     Now, I think that's the -- that's the argument.     And so, what -- I would like to hear what you have to say about that argument.       Uh-huh.       All right.     Now -       But my question is, what leads you to that conclusion?       What are -- there are very, very few cases I can ever think of where -- where the President -- where the Court has said the President can act contrary to a statute.     And so, the point of my question was to get you to talk about -       -- why, even though this is a fortiori.       I just want -- I don't want the time to elapse.     You can finish that if you'd like. I'd just like somewhere a few words about the political question, which you don't believe in.     From reading your brief, I would say you don't believe in it much.     And my question on the political question for either of you is this:     that -- that this is an area of foreign affairs. It's an area of -- of, you know, recognition.     We know that.     Never has this Court or anyone else held that Congress can go ahead in this area over a law passed by Congress.     But it is passports, which both regulate. And our real problem is these are words that are officially said and they are detailed words, and those words may really disrupt coherent foreign policy. Viewed that way, there are billions of words that might have the same effect.     And do we know that these words will and some other words won't?     No, judges don't know that. And, therefore, when you get into this area, the best thing to do is avoid multifarious pronouncements by various departments of government on one question; do not respect the views of other branches; and, judges, stay out of it.     Let them work it out by themselves. I just want a word from either you and really Mr. Lewin on -- on that.
10-704 +++$+++       Yes, but what's the difference between what you just said and the situation 9     here?    You say, if he sees the gun next to the bed, for 10     example, or in the closet, and he's in the house looking 11     for the sawed-off shotgun, he could seize it.    He can't 12     unless he has probable cause to think it might be used 13     for a crime.      And so, how did that 16     change?    How did that change suddenly because he 17     happened to see in the house something in the closet, 18     and nothing else changed?    Why now suddenly can he take 19     it?      No, but your argument is 25     there was no probable cause for thinking that the guns in the house, if there were other guns, would be used 2     for a crime.    Now, your opponent, your brother there, 3     said when I suggested that:    Oh, no, that's wrong; there 4     is probable cause to think that any guns in the house 5     would be used for a crime.    He hasn't killed the girl 6     yet, and one gun's as good as another.    And he might 7     well take one of those other guns and kill her.    So, 8     there's probable cause to believe that the guns that are 9     in the house, or at least one could reasonably think so, 10     would be used for a crime.    That was his response. 11                 Then, as to whether they're likely to be in 12     the house, well, we know this:    We know he has a sawed-off shotgun, and we know he is a member of a gang, 14     which is defined as a group of people engaged in definable criminal activity, creating an atmosphere of 16     fear and intimidation.      And you don't have to -- you have to show more than that there's no probable 2     cause.    You have to show it wasn't reasonable to think 3     that there was probable cause.      That's how he knows that. 14     That's how he knows.      If that is the -- we're 22     using a purely objective standard, another fact that I 23     just want your reaction on is where he says, "I told you 24     never to call the cops on me."    Now, he has tried to 25     throw her out of the window or something.    He -- he's shot at her.    He's trying to kill her in five different 2     ways, and he's shouting:    I'm going to kill you and I 3     told you never to call the cops on me. When I first read that I thought, well, 5     maybe he has some -- maybe this is explained in part not 6     just domestic, but he has something to hide.    He's afraid she's going to tell the police something.    Now -- 8     now, could a person reasonably read those words and 9     think he has something to hide here?    His -- and there's      Can we read it that way? 14     And if we do read it that way, where does that lead you? 15                 MR. WOLFSON question; he is a gang member -- not in support of 2     probable cause, but in support of night service.    They 3     told the magistrate that they had reviewed all the 4     various government databases, specifically including 5     police databases, but did not tell the magistrate that 6     he had any criminal record at all.
10-708 +++$+++       What is the -- I think -- 22     this is very interesting and informative to me.    Go back 23     to the middle category.    As I'm now seeing it, you have 24     a version of the middle category that the Chief Justice 25     was asking.    And -- and call it Congress sometimes passes a statute that creates a pariah.    It could be a 2     substance.    It could be a form of behavior.    It could be 3     a structure of an industry. And then once it does that, it makes that 5     unlawful.    And now what it's done, it is more unusual 6     than I ever thought.    It comes up in the loyalty 7     context, fiduciary, but we're not talking about fiduciary.    It says it is a harm and you will earn money 9     if you deal with a pariah, assuming it wasn't your fault. Now, that's where I have ended up with your 12     answers to the Chief, and now, having put it that way, I 13     can find loads of examples in my mind where there's a 14     trustee or fiduciary involved.    I can think of an 15     example in the qui tam context, but to think of one 16     right on point is a little hard, though I thought there 17     must be some.      You mean you can sue in 3     court even if what you come in and you say, they breached my contract, and as a result, I made $10,000 I 5     wouldn't have otherwise made?    And when the judge says 6     "And what damages do you seek," you say?      All right.    Okay. 17                 MR. LAMKEN      Justice Scalia has a point, 5     because, I mean, as I heard him, he was -- he was reiterating what used to be called a prudential rule of 7     standing.    It wasn't constitutional, but you looked to 8     see if the statute is meant to protect this kind of 9     person against that kind of harm.    All right?    And if not, there's lack of prudential standing. Well, if that's the test, his case would 12     fall outside it, because the tax law is not meant to 13     protect the plaintiff there, but this case would fall 14     within it.
10-76 +++$+++ 
10-779 +++$+++        All right, suppose - suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides -- finds the following.     They say:     We have found that when drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that the doctor find out what's curable, what the drug does, how much it costs; and by the way, all those things apply no matter who the doctor is.     Who the doctor is, is irrelevant.     And therefore marketing that focuses upon who the doctor is and what his previous practices were is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore we find that it is a false and deceptive practice under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the following prior practices of the doctor in selling him new drugs, because it's irrelevant and because it's false and because it's harmful.     And they enact that as a -- as a rule of the Federal Trade Commission. Does the Constitution of the United States forbid them, having made those findings in detail, from controlling advertising to prevent what they have determined is a false and misleading practice?       Oh, nobody says it doesn't apply.     The question -       So therefore I would like to know the answer.       This is a highly regulated industry.       If the Federal Trade Commission's specialists and experts in false and deceptive advertising concludes that this is a false and deceptive practice, are you going to say that the Constitution of the United States forbids them from doing that?       Well -- well, when you say you are, is there any precedent that says they can't regulate false and misleading practice?     Of course you see where I'm going.       If they can, why can't Vermont?       Well, they said it was biased -       -- and they -- they have made a study of it in the legislature and that's their conclusion.       That's where I was going.       I chose an example that's beyond your case.       But that's why I wondered how you would respond to that.     So -- I thought that was one that was going to be obviously constitutional, but you're going to stop me there.     So -- so what I want to say -       -- is how is this different?       And I suppose I don't know the extent to which this does or does not promote unbiased information from going to the doctors, and isn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the Vermont legislature rather than this Court to decide?       Could the Federal Power - the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say, we want you to collect certain information about who is using what natural gas and give it to the fire department? It's for the fire department in case of emergency, and what we don't want to have happen is it's used to stove manufacturers to sell homeowners gas stoves.       They could do that?       All right, fine.     If they could do that, why can't they do this?       Well, this is information -- see, this is information that starts off being collected because the government requires it to be collected.     So it's there for that reason.     And the government says we want you to get this information, it's done for this purpose, so, you know, other purposes, and we don't want it to be used for commercial advertising purposes.     That's what they say they've done in this statute.       It used to be true there was something called a regulated industry.       And selling was within activity among many.       And there were lots of regulations that could be imposed upon selling.       Are you saying that all those should be reexamined?
10-788 +++$+++        Is it different from -- I mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking. I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand jury room, and then there is some evidence about what went on inside.     And I don't know when you're supposed to introduce what. So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that if you win, the rule about when you should use or when you still can use the testimony that's given in the grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when you can use the testimony of a witness at trial. See, I would have thought that immunity means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm wrong about that.     You sometimes can use it.     So, then I don't know when you can use it and when you can't. Maybe you know.     You've studied this case.     I admit I haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have. (Laughter.)       Yes.       When you say absolutely immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows: Smith says to his friend:     I hate that rat Jones.     I am going to go and lie and say he stole my horse. Next step, he goes to the grand jury or someone and says:     Jones stole my horse. Third step, he's in the grand jury room saying:     Jones stole my horse. Fourth, he's at trial.     Okay? So, what comes in and what doesn't?     And can you bring a case in the first place?       I'm at sea.     Whatever you can help me with, I'd be happy.       There's always something else.     He didn't think of this thing for the first time in the grand jury room.     The defendant thought of this thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it, or he could have, or at least there's the evidence he walked to the grand jury room.     Okay?     So, there's always something outside the grand jury.       Is the prosecutor immune? I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining witness is not when they get an arrest warrant.     Is the prosecutor immune when he is taking the step of getting an information or indictment?       He is immune?       All right.     So, this is equivalent to doing that.     That's a prosecutorial function.     The prosecution would be immune.       Of course, this isn't a prosecutor; this is a subordinate.     The person here is the defendant who is not the prosecutor --       Is there any subordinate government official involved when a prosecutor gets an information, files an information or -- the way you get somebody indicted is you have an indictment, which is a grand jury, I guess.       Or an information.       All right.     When you get the information, is it just somebody from the district attorney's office or the prosecutor's office, or is there somebody else there?     Is there a policeman there that gives any --       Can be, okay.     If there is, has he ever been held immune or not?     The prosecutor is immune.     Now he's there with an assistant, the policeman to back him up.     Is there any law on that, whether the policeman is immune?       No, the arrest warrant, he's not immune.     We know he's not that.     It's just he files the information.       No.       No.
10-8145 +++$+++        What is this?     I mean, I thought -- I may -- I thought the issue is that there were some notes, and the first note, which was made on the day, the policeman says that Boatner said he could not supply a description of the perpetrator, other than to say they were black males.     Then he said they had golden teeth and a low-cut haircut. And 5 days later, he said he could not ID anyone because he couldn't see faces.     Then he said he'd only glanced at the first man.     He couldn't tell if they had their faces covered and didn't see anyone.     Then he said, I could not ID, would not know them if I saw them. And another set of police notes says he said that he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder. So, I guess those are all notes that the -- the prosecution did not give to the defense.     So, if you were a defense lawyer, whatever this other stuff is, I guess you would have been pretty happy to have those notes because you might have tried to impeach his identification.       And so, what are -- you're saying that I guess it would have made no difference?       Then I'd like to hear that because it seems on its face that it certainly could have made a difference, that if he had those notes that he could have tried to impeach him and said where did this sudden recognition come from.       So, I take it that your --       Is it that you mean immaterial, or is it that you mean that it wasn't prejudicial because there's so much other evidence, there was no reasonable probability it would have made a difference in the trial?       Okay.     So, we can forget the word "material." Now, you're saying there's so much other evidence here against him that it wouldn't have made any difference.       Now, I can understand that argument.       But I don't know if it's right.     That is -- that is -- now I think I can go back to Justice Kennedy's question, put it in those terms, and say, well, why wouldn't -- this could have made a difference.     I mean, here, we have this witness who said all of these great things for your side, and within a space of hours, he has been telling the policemen that he can't identify anybody, he doesn't know.     I mean, what -- that sounds like there's a probability that would have made a difference.     Why not?       It's so odd that -- I mean, look, it seems like here it is 5 days after the shooting and well before, I guess, that this witness saw any mug shots or did anything.     And he says, I could not identify anyone, because he couldn't see the faces of the people.     And now you're saying later, which you introduce into trial, his having looked at the faces of people and identified them from their faces. Now, previously, he said he couldn't see their faces.     All right.     And in Louisiana, the State of Louisiana, the prosecution and the judges say that isn't -- you don't have to turn over that statement that he couldn't see the faces made earlier.       What?       Oh, you mean all these -- all these statements that we have here, you're saying, all referred to people other than the defendant.       All right.     Well, was there a finding on that?       Perhaps the defense would have liked to say they did apply to the defendant.       This was not at the scene.       So, you're --       All right.     He says, I can't identify --       All right, I -- and my point then is this seems very odd, I mean, really unusual that in the State of Louisiana that they have some kind of system that doesn't turn that statement over to the defense.
10-844 +++$+++       Okay.    It says, "If the 5     [NDA] holder" -- now that's -- that's Novo -- "holder of 6     the approval" -- "the approval holder for the drug, 7     a" -- I'm skipping words -- "a use of which is claimed 8     by the patent" -- and that's what you are doing.    And 9     what is that use?    Well, I look at page 12, and the use 10     is "a method for improving glycemic control in adults 11     with type 2 diabetes mellitus." So, that's the use that you're -- that's the 13     use that's claimed by the patent.    If you bring "a 14     patent infringement action against the [ANDA] applicant" 15     -- that's them -- "the [ANDA] applicant may assert a 16     counterclaim" -- which they want to do -- "seeking an 17     order requiring the holder to correct...the patent 18     information on the ground that the patent does not 19     claim...an approved method of using the drug." So, I look at that with those words -- I've 21     skipped words.    I look at those words, and I say that's 22     what they're saying.    They're saying the use that -- 23     that your patent does not cover a portion of the set of 24     things described by your use.    And, therefore, they 25     would like to correct the description so that the description no longer covers something that you do not 2     have -- a use that you do not have a patent on. 3                 Now, that would seem to me to fit within 4     those literal words.    And, of course, the purpose is 5     what we've been arguing about.    But just looking at the 6     literal words, why doesn't it fit?      I know, but are you saying 25     it is patent information?      You don't need that 6     argument.      If you're right that patent 9     information in this particular provision does not have 10     anything to do with, or at least does not cover, the 11     words about diabetes I just read, well, then I guess 12     this section would have nothing to do with it because 13     those are the words they want corrected, aren't they? 14                 MR. PERRY      Yes, but what it also says 6     is this -- and that's what I want to go back to this 7     literal statutory argument.    We took the words -- 8     because this is what you can correct.    What you can 9     correct, the statute says, is you can correct "patent 10     information submitted by the holder under subsection (b) 11     or (c)."    So, we look at (b), and what (b) says is (b) 12     tells us that you're supposed to submit, in respect to 13     where you claim the use of a drug, the patent number and 14     the expiration date.    So, so far, that seems to support 15     you. But then we look at the regulations which 17     the FDA promulgated, I take it promulgated in respect to 18     (b) and (c), particularly the sentence I read or maybe 19     some similar sentence.    And it tells you that you have 20     to provide the description of the patented method of use 21     as required for publication.    So, now I go back and look 22     to what you did provide.    And what you did provide was 23     you provided -- you said that what we do, we have a 24     method for improving glycemic control in adults with 25     type 2 diabetes mellitus. That seems to fit directly under (3) of the 2     FDA's requirement, and that FDA requirement was an expansion of (b).    And, therefore, it sounds to me as if 4     when they say "correct," "correct the patent information," it includes the sentence that you put 6     there that they'd like to see corrected.    Now, what's 7     wrong with that?      And this is about the most 2     technical statute I ever read --      -- and -- and when I'm 5     talking about patent information among (b) and (c), we 6     have the Government telling us that that covers this. 7     And why don't I just stop right there and say thank 8     goodness I'm out of this case -- and I'm not out of it. 9                 (Laughter.)
10-8505 +++$+++ 
10-875 +++$+++       Just following up on 8     that --      Yes.    Okay.    So, we have 4     three categories of people that -- where the taxes, 5     literally taken, they incur postpetition taxes.    Now, 6     the bite would come up if it turned out, when they were 7     getting around to settle these things, that there isn't 8     enough money to pay fully the postpetition or let's -- 9     no, to pay fully domestic support obligations, wages, and also Federal taxes.      Okay.      How would it show up?    I 11     mean, what difference -- suppose -- suppose you -- in 11 12     individual, 12, or 13, what's the difference whether you 13     treated it as an administrative expense or not, as long 14     as they all have to be paid anyway, you say?      No.    I mean, how would we 20     know?    How would we know --      Yes.      I know.    Let's imagine 4     you're absolutely right.    They mean to treat them 5     differently.      They mean to treat the 8     postpetition tax obligation to the Federal Government 9     not as an administrative expense.    But this is an 10     instance where the business will continue, and,      Therefore, what difference 16     does it make whether you do or whether you don't treat 17     them as administrative expenses?    What is the 18     operational difference?
10-879 +++$+++        Why would their law be pre-empted, a State law that says since the railroad knows that asbestos is dangerous when revealed and since it would be revealed in a repair shop, the railroad has to provide the repair shops with appropriate worker safety equipment; or alternatively, and lesser, the railroad has to provide for the repair shop's documents to be given to the workers which explain the risks and how they can overcome them. Now, in respect to that, which I'll lump under various kinds of failure-to-warn claims, how does the Act pre-empt those?     It doesn't affect design of the railroad, nor does it affect the use.     Neither.       But -- no, no, no.     That argument would prevent States doing what they can do lawfully, which is to regulate the repair shop because with any given repair, with many of them, you could say, well, we wouldn't have to -- we can just change the locomotive design, for example.     It carries beds with it so that the workers who are repairing it get adequate sleep.     I mean, that isn't an answer to the argument that it doesn't affect design to say, well, they could comply with it by changing design, I don't think.       No, what they're saying is --       What they're saying is because when you open up the box, something no one does on line, you will expose yourself to risk, and what we are saying is, therefore, you must post a notice that tells workers about those risks.     And, indeed, if there is a conflict, conflict pre-emption will take care of it.     But why should that kind of thing fall within the scope of field pre-emption even under Napier, which, of course, referred to equipment while this rule doesn't? It refers to a sign.     You're not going to change the equipment.
10-895 +++$+++        But what are -- I mean, what are we arguing about?     It's a -- he should have filled in the blank and said there's a Speedy Trial Act issue, and he didn't.     The judge didn't.     He should have done it; he didn't.       So, now I am the court of appeals judge, I get this, and I say, oh, my God, he forgot to fill in the right number; I'll tell you what, I'll fill it in, and I'll sign my name.     Is that legal?       I'm a judge in the court of appeals.     I have the case here.     I say -- I say:     Oh, my God, I've read the appendix.     I don't always read appendices, but sometimes I do.     And I notice that there's blank here, and it's supposed to say Speedy Trial Act.     So, I get out my pen, and I say Speedy Trial Act, SB.     I sign it.     Okay?     Now, is everything okay?       All right.     So, what are we arguing about?     Why not just say, look, this is like the Copyright Act registration requirement?       I mean, it's not jurisdictional in the sense that the court has to look through all these appendices itself to see that everything is perfect.     It's just something you should do.     And if you didn't do it, then in an appropriate case, the judge could do it himself or waive it or whatever makes sense in the circumstance.     What's wrong with that?       Well, suppose we say -- if they entered judgment without it, we will assume, nunc pro tunc, they did it.       What is the horrible thing about that?       You tell me.     This is a statute the purpose of which was to speed things up, which was to help courts of appeals by eliminating dross --       -- while focusing on issues that really do have constitutional issues.     Now, suddenly what's worrying me -- and I don't have the definite answer -- is if I adopt your interpretation, this is jurisdictional, I am somehow increasing the workload of the courts of appeals because they will have to have staff people going through to see whether every i is dotted and every t crossed and they did have all the right things there, and the pain of doing that is if you don't do it, then you have to do these things over again.     It will be too late.     People will get another argument.       Well, why then?     I mean, you can read the statute differently.     You can say:     I'm now the court of appeals judge.     I look at it.     Lo and behold, there are two blanks.     But on the basis of what I've read in the briefs and the record, I can say that the appellant has made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right.     I know the record, and he has these things there.     And also, I know what they are. Okay? So, I fill in the blanks, or the chief judge of the circuit fills in the blanks with the panel's approval.     Now, the only reason for doing that is that it saves everybody a lot of time and that it costs nobody anything.     So -- so, why not, since the language permits it, do that?       Well, yes, you're giving the conclusion.       I've just said the statute doesn't.     They can take the appeal, and they're not going to get anywhere because of this error of the lower court judge --       -- unless the court of appeals, having looked at the record a little bit, discovers that there is a substantial constitutional question, and they know what it is, and then they fill in the blanks.       And in the language -- it allows that, I believe, and the purpose would allow it, for, after all, the purpose is to be more efficient, not less efficient.     And I can't think of any harm that's done reading it that way. So, you tell me what is the harm that's done.       No, no.     They can't, you see, because I'd have to be able to fill in those blanks, or goodbye.     So, it doesn't get any meritless ones up there.     The only ones that come up are merit -- merited.       Oh no, if there's an insurmountable obstacle -- although, as in this case perhaps we don't reach the constitutional issue -- there is one there, so it is appealable, but we say we do not reach it because there is this impossible procedural obstacle that here blocks it. There we have a system that seems more efficient and seems what is being argued, and all we have to do is say this is not a jurisdictional requirement in (2) or (3), and there we have it. Now, what's wrong with it?       -- if I say that.       So, I could just sign this tomorrow and that would moot this case and get rid of it. (Laughter.)

10-945 +++$+++        Visual observation from more than 2 feet, or less than 2 feet?       Okay.     What happened?     Do we know?     Was the search within 2 feet or not within 2 feet?       We don't know.       Try the ABA.     The ABA is minor offenses, not drugs, not violence, and there you have to have reasonable suspicion.     Now, I've read through the briefs, and I can't find a lot of contrabanders that were caught in that category.     In fact, my law clerk thinks it's one out of 64,000 or less.     So -- so, what is the justification for a rule to avoid reasonable suspicion in that category?       It's a conclusion -       -- and we have a lot of practical experience because different States have different rules, and San Francisco came in with I think the toughest on your side, for your side.     I just say, looking through that, it's very hard to find somebody who really was in this minor offender category, who really was found to have contraband.     So, what should I look at to show that my initial reaction from a quick reading is wrong.       I mean, do I just say this is a -       Is there any evidence -- I count seven or eight States anyway that have some variation of the reasonable suspicion rule like what they want, roughly.     Is there any evidence at all that in those seven or eight States, there is more contraband being smuggled in?       That's my -- that's my problem.     I don't -- I overstated the -- the strength of your evidence.     I was just trying to throw it out -- or I understated it.     San Francisco's point is really that to 60 percent or some very high percentage of people who come in for minor crimes are high on drugs or have been -- and there is just that footnote really which has a few examples.     Definitely, they're there in this category.     So, would it be helpful if you included in the excluded part people who are high on drugs?     You see?     So, we give you the high on drugs people.     It's the drug offense, and those who are high on drugs and those -- I mean, is there a way of drawing this rule that we can even catch most of the people in footnote -       But it's obvious that the simplest thing for any prison official is say do it for everybody.       And so, the fact they do it for everybody and don't try to make some exclusion for traffic violators or something might be consistent with little or no evidence; it might be consistent with some. That's why I keep looking for it.
10-948 +++$+++  
10-9646 +++$+++        Of the numbers, the 79 to -- I guess there's some disagreement whether it's 82 or 79.     Regardless, in your opinion, or maybe it's in the briefs -- I just can't remember it -- of those, say, 79, how many are there for reasons of mandatory sentence where they would not -- no one could consider the individualized nature of the crime or the criminal?       What's your estimate?       That's all right.     What's your estimate?       Well, how many come from the States that have this mandatory system?     That shouldn't be too hard to find out.       Non-mandatory.     So -      So, you think it's almost -- it's probably 90 percent.      And that's -- all right. Say it's about 70 or 71, and I remember reading a statistic somewhere where they managed to count up the number of possibilities, i.e., serious murders committed by those under 15 over 50 years or some long number of years, and it was somewhere in the 70,000s, was it?    Or 20,000s?    What was it?      Seventy-five hundred?      That sounds more  that sounds about reasonable.      It's about 1 percent.      One percent.    If I carry that number around in my mind, that 1 percent of those who might have obtained this terrible penalty, 1 percent are actually given it?       I see.     All right.      All right, but what is --      -- the justification?    You are going to get to this, I guess -- so, I'll -- but I want to be sure you do at some point.     And I'm not certain it's a -- it's a cruel and unusual punishment argument.    It may be more of a due process argument.    But I want to know the justification -- giving all those statistics that you've seen and that was in Roper and so forth -- procedurally speaking, what is the justification for not giving the defendant any opportunity to point to mitigating features in his lack of development, in his age, in his upbringing, et cetera?    That to me is a difficult question, but before we get to that topic, I dont want to --.       So, is that -- I have -- I understand their arguments, both sides.     I think I've pretty much got the arguments on the question of the individualized sentencing.     You can make an argument that it should be individualized, life without parole, up to age 18; say 7 through 17.     And there's an argument the other way which you're making.     Okay. What I want to know is your argument the opposite way on this one.     What's the minimum age, in your opinion, or is there any constitutional minimum at all in respect to which you could give for a murder a child life without parole?     I mean, you could have an instance of a 10-year-old or an 8-year-old.     I mean, is it totally up to the States, or is there a minimum?     And if there is a minimum, what is it in your opinion?       What is it?       Well, do your best.       Do your best.       Do you want to say 12?       Do you want to say 10?     Do you want to say 9?     Because as soon as whatever you say, I'm going to say:     And why not 14?       Do you see the difficulty? All right.     So, now put yourself in my position, because my --       That's why he's arguing that the legislatures don't focus on it.     If you do a public opinion poll, or just ask me, for example, or ask anyone, you say the question is:     Should -- at what age should juveniles be able to be transferred out of the juvenile system into the adult system? You might get one answer.     Maybe 14, maybe 15, maybe 12. But if you put the question, at what age should they be receiving a mandatory life without parole, the answer might be different.     And his point is they never ask that question.     They ask the first question, not the second.     And that disturbs me enough to think that I can't think the answer to this question that I asked you just relies on public opinion polls or even just the number of States.     I'm not sure about it. But that's why I want to hear your response, because it sounds like we're arguing between whether it should be 13, 12, or 14, in terms of an absolute cutoff. So, how do I approach that?     I'm asking you for help on that one.     I know you have a side in this.     But I say, well, we're talking about 14, and we have all this scientific literature and so forth.
10-98 +++$+++ 
10-9995 +++$+++        Where --       Where?     What's the case that supports you the most on that?       No, just give me a citation.       Has to -- has to be what? What's the word?     "Unequivocal"?       Because I'll look at the statute. Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's Law Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it seems like you lose. My analysis would be this:     Forfeiture is the "loss of a right" -- that's what's at issue -- "because of a crime."     That doesn't apply.     "Because of a breach of obligation."     That doesn't apply.     "Neglect of duty."     Now, that does because you didn't file the answer.     Okay?     So, that's forfeited. Now you look over to waiver and, as you say, it says "voluntary relinquishment of a legal right." Okay, what's the legal right?     The legal right is to get the case dismissed. So, I'm the judge.     I say, State, do you want to get the case dismissed?     I just gave your answer.     Okay.     I say you voluntarily relinquish your legal right.     Your legal right was to get the case dismissed, and you relinquished it.     You didn't assert it. That said, that would be the difference. And she's saying that.     She's saying that makes a lot of sense.     When you read Day, they're worried about the State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake. So, what the judge says is:     State, you know you have a pretty good claim here on statute of limitations, but you didn't assert it.     So, I'm going to give you the right to assert it.     Go ahead, assert it even though it's late.     You overcome the forfeiture. Now you say:     I assert it, Your Honor. Okay, you haven't waived it.     Now you say:     I don't really care.       Oh, no.     I assume they didn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick. It was just what is it that they did?     And what they did is they were given the opportunity to overcome the forfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim, and they didn't do it.     They didn't want to do it.     I don't know why they didn't want to do it, because there was a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah, dah.     But that's their business.     The fact is they didn't do it.       Wait, wait, wait.     When you say "further," I want to be very precise about the distinction.     You have to put it in your answer.     You didn't.     Okay.     So, that's a forfeiture.     So, now the judge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll raise it.     So, now you have the right to have the case dismissed for statute of limitations.     Do you want to exercise that right?     The answer to that question was you didn't.       You said you didn't care.       All right.     Well, but, one, do the characterization, but please don't forget my first question, because so far I'm just stuck on Black's Law Dictionary.     And I would like you to have better authorities for your -- you know, the supporting --       Well, that's why your colleague on the other side -- why she made this point the way she made it.     I think there's no disagreement, at least as far as I hear Justice Scalia.     Look, he did abandon his right, the State, to push the matter. That's abandonment.     He didn't abandon the right to get the case dismissed if the judge pursues it. So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a court of appeals does have the power on its own to overcome a forfeiture.     That's Day.     But they don't have the power on its own to overcome the waiver.     And that's what they're doing.     They don't have the power, in other words, to decide it themselves.     They only have the power to overcome a forfeiture.       So, why is that -- why is that a bad result?     The -- I -- imagine the facts are these:     The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise the issue in the defense.     All right?     Forgets. Judge:     State you haven't raised a statute of limitations. State -- one possible answer -- thank you, Your Honor.     We overlooked our forfeiture.     We want to raise it. That's one. Number two:     They say we don't care. Number three:     We don't want to.     Okay?       Now, in two and three, you can say this:     You could say the reason that we depart from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it in your defense is we're trying to protect the State because of habeas.     So, we protect the State at least by giving them a chance to make the argument when they forget or some other reason.     Now we gave them the chance.     Now they say:     Huh?     Who cares? All right?     If that's their attitude, why is it the habeas court's business to protect the State from themselves?       Despite forfeiture?       And --
105, Orig. +++$+++               It is -- I mean, if you want to really get a little complicated, the -- you have -- you have 11, and 11 talked about the Supreme Court fees and then we have 20 and that talks about all the other fees, right?       Okay.        So the thing is, you can't pay money in the United States unless have you some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court some authorization to fix fees. Now we look back at 1821.                   And 1821 tells you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be. It says he will be paid an attendance fee of $40 per day.   Doesn't say you couldn't pay him more.                  Just says that's what he is entitled to.              Now of course, in the lower courts, you can't pay him more because there is no authority to pay him more.          But in the Supreme Court, there is authority to pay him more.                     That comes out of 1911. I mean, I grant you that this is -- what I'm actually doing here is I'm trying to avoid this problem of whether Congress can start legislating the details of original jurisdiction rules and so forth.                     Just -- there is some desirability here constitutionally to prevent ourselves from going down that road.                    That's -- I'm deliberately being gimmicky, but what do you think of this gimmick?              That's fair. (Laughter.)              Yes.      Yes.              Which part did they think limited it?     Was it 1821 they thought limited it?              In an ordinary case, if a witness -- doesn't -- never does go to court, but just goes to a deposition, that's the only thing, he goes to a deposition, does he get paid the 40 dollars?               He goes to a lawyer's office; he's never in attendance at a court.     But Do they count that as being in attendance at a court?              Then where is his --              What?              If that isn't attendance at a court, where did these witnesses show up?              Where?           Where do they have this proceeding?     I don't know; it wasn't here; it wasn't in this --              Where?              In the courthouse?              Well, what about -- I mean now, as long as I'm starting down the road to outer space, why not -- could we say, look, they were very impressive models these people did; on both sides they had terrific experts, very expensive; and would we have the authority to say to the master, although you didn't treat them as your experts, you should have done, for purposes of paying them.              I don't want to be unreasonable about this. (Laughter.)
11-10189 +++$+++        So he can do this -- I didn't understand this.     I'm sorry. Joe Smith is convicted on day 1.     The transcript appears 9 months later.     Okay?     9 months later his new lawyer, who is supposed to proceed on appeal, reads the transcript.     He thinks, hmm, I think there was a problem with his lawyer at the trial, and I would like to raise this claim and get a new trial. And you are saying what he does is he goes back to the trial court, and he says, Judge, I just read this, it raises some factual matters; will you please give me an evidentiary hearing with the old lawyer there and me there, so we can develop this? Now, that is what -- how Texas works?       Because I did not get that impression from the State Bar brief, but you are saying that is how it works? Page 29       You go to the court of appeals, and what do you say?     You say, court of appeals, will you please direct the trial court to have an evidentiary hearing on the adequacy of trial counsel before you hear the appeal?       Is that yes or no?       Okay.     So you are just saying that they are all wrong about how Texas works, so I guess you -- you could refer to a case where that happened.       Well, in what case did that happen?       Cooks vs. State.     And they got the transcript, months later, and they looked back, and they said, oh, dear, there was something wrong with Page 30 the trial performance.     So we go to the Federal appeals -- the State appeals court, and we say, State appeals court, please direct an evidentiary hearing. And they directed an evidentiary hearing, and they had an evidentiary hearing before the trial judge -- really, what would have happened on State habeas?       All right.     Now, I am puzzled about what I'm supposed to do because I would have thought that the standard's fairly easy, that this individual must always have one full and fair opportunity to present his claim of inadequate assistance at trial. There are certain things that could deprive him of that.     One, his lawyer in the habeas State could be incompetent -- all these lawyers could be incompetent.     Or the State, at a certain stage, didn't give him enough proceeding.     All right? Well, what do I do, where people are disagreeing about how the State procedure works, as to whether it was full and fair?     What do I do?     What is Page 31 your suggestion? By the way, if he doesn't get the full and fair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge that he has a substantial claim, that that trial was not -- so what do you suggest?       Right now -- but I'm saying What do you -- I would like you to sympathize with my problem.     My problem is I have seen -- I have a bunch of briefs.     And they seem to me that what you have just described is a full and fair procedure to develop all these evidentiary matters before the appeal even takes place. It exists in Texas, and, therefore, unless he could say his lawyer there was incompetent, he's out of luck.     Okay?     The other side seems to say, no, it doesn't exist in Texas.     And, now, what am I supposed to Page 32 do, since I am not an expert on Texas procedure?       But -- but don't say never. All right.     So one thing we got --       What happens -- imagine we have a State supreme court, and it says, okay, you could raise this claim on appeal, we don't advise it, we think -- it's so much easier to do it in State habeas. Please do it in State habeas.     It's not absolutely binding, but do it.     Okay?     That's what they are saying. Now, he raises nine of his ten ineffective assistance of counsel claims in State habeas.     And the State habeas court says, no, you are out on all nine, but he never raised the tenth. Now, we are in Federal court, and the prisoner says -- you know, that tenth claim is fabulous. And the judge says, it is substantial.     And he says, you know why it wasn't raised before?     Because my counsel was incompetent on State habeas, and they didn't raise it on appeal because that's just how people normally do Page 41 things in Texas, they don't raise it on appeal.     They wait until State habeas. Has that person had a full and fair opportunity to raise this tenth claim in the State court?       They are not saying never. They are just saying it works so much better.     What they say is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time, it's easier to develop it.     Please.     We won't say never. We'll just say hardly ever. Now, what's -- what is the -- what is your view about whether that person has had a full and fair opportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance claim in the State courts.       I'm not even thinking about Martinez at the moment because I don't want to get into whether it is an extension or just an elaboration or just a situation covered, but they didn't think of it or just a lot of other things. Page 42 I just want to know, given Martinez, what do you think?       What is the standard you are advocating?       But if, in fact, they say, yes, there is a route, never used, but once, filled with minefields, very hard when compared with the other one, there you say, it isn't Martinez, it is a totally -- it is a new thing because Martinez, after all, had no rationale.       I'm being sarcastic there, but I don't mean to be.     I mean, you see what I'm trying to get to?       Yes, the dissent said that. (Laughter.)
11-1025 +++$+++        I think the -- which I think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat unique, so that what you're worried about most is the definition of foreign intelligence information, which defines it to include information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the conduct of foreign affairs.     It's very general.       And then, the Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary wiretapping. Now, you say, look, if there is any special group that's going to apply to, that is the group that they wiretapped 10,000 times when they didn't even have that authority.     And the government is saying, maybe, maybe not.     And there, we have an argument. Is there a way of resolving it?     That is, is it open to the government, if you prevail, and we say, you know, they have this extra broad authority, there is no way to check it through a court, it does cause harm, these are the most likely people to be harmed and there is very good reason, whatever words we use there, to think it will be used for them, that the government -- is there some way the government could say, in camera even, no, we are not doing it?     Here are our procedures. We are not going to show them to anybody but you, judge. I mean, is there a way for the government to show that you're wrong --       -- and that we're wrong when we think you're right?       What?       That's on that branch of your argument, which makes me more nervous than the other branch.     The other branch, they might say something like:     We're supposed to minimize risks of catching in surveillance Americans and this is what we do.     And they show that and they say:     We go to the FISA court.     Except in these very rare instances where there are emergencies, da, da, da. And I guess by that point they might be able to reduce the risks to this kind of plaintiff to where it's the same as virtually anybody else or they might be -- be showing it's constitutional.     That's where I -- that's why I ask the question.     I'm not certain of where I am going.
11-10362 +++$+++        What does it leave out? What does it leave out, your theory?     A policeman's a law enforcement officer.     What does he do on his job that isn't in a law enforcement role?       Oh, I see.       So your idea here is a park policeman who is engaged in law enforcement some of the time, but engaged in giving tours the rest of the time. You're saying what you would do is say when he's engaged in the law enforcement he's covered, but not when he's engaged in the tour.      Well, why isn't this -- why isn't what the prison guard does law enforcement?     I mean, the law says these people are going to be locked up and he's enforcing that.      It says he's going to be in prison under these da, da, da, da, da.     You know, all that da, da, da means the conditions of the prison, et cetera, they're all regulations, rules, statutes.    He's enforcing them, why not?      Well, so now you're saying what those three things could provide the definition?      And are you saying that?      Yeah, but EPA is not what I'm thinking of, I don't think they are.    I am thinking of policemen.    Okay.    Now, one basic job of a policeman is to patrol, but not arresting people, not searching and not seizing evidence.    They are on patrol.    That's basically what they do.    All right?    Is that a law enforcement activity?       Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean in places -- it's Federal, I understand.    So I'm sure we can find analogies in the Federal situation to ordinary policemen.      All right.    But FBI agents, who are the federal police, they're people on Federal enclaves, for example, there are -- they are on Federal enclaves, they act like policemen, okay.      Okay.    That's favorable.    I mean, what I'm thinking of is either you can have a broad definition or one that's going to get into trouble when we consider real policemen.     So if you have a broad one, then I don't see how prison guards get out of it. If you have a narrow one, my guess is we could find lots of Federal policemen who really are policemen who aren't doing what falls -- who are doing what falls outside your narrow definition.     I wish I could think of better examples, but I came up with the ones I did.
11-1059 +++$+++        Well, you're interpreting -- I think it's true that we're interpreting the statute, and -- and I'm trying to look at what document are we interpreting?     Is there a different rule or a different -- what -- what rule? So I could come back to the statute.     And Congress could deprive -- could provide exactly the system that you suggest.     I don't see anything unconstitutional about it.     But isn't it a little hard to read this statute as providing that mechanism, since what it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it says what it says in the last two sentences. How do we read that to foresee the mechanism that you're talking about?       Well, he says the difference in the class action context is, in the class action context, you can consider them there, but there isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute, which says, no one shall be a party unless he signs in writing.       Well, why?     Why?       Because that's -- why? Why, is my question?       How does that differ from an employee who says that he is annoyed for a variety of reasons at the employer, and he sues the employer for his pay -- for his pay for the month of October.     The employer says, He got his pay, I -- I sent him the check, I mean, he gets it every month.     And he says, yes, but I didn't cash the check. Is there a case for controversy?     He can go sue for his paycheck that he didn't cash?       Okay.     So why is it any different when the -- the defendant -- employer says, here's the check.       And he says, oh, I didn't cash it.       Now, we have a case if the employer, for some reason -- a mistake in bookkeeping or something -- didn't send the check on time, so it arrived 3 days late.     And he says, ha, I'm not cashing the check; now, I can sue him.     Right?     That's your theory.       No, no.     He -- he -- it's a contract -- you know.     He -- he is paid every month, the end of the month.       Even though the -- the employer gave him the paycheck.     He just didn't cash it, plus the damage is for the 3 days.
11-1085 +++$+++        This is true, but I'm -- I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this: That -- that why do we use an efficient market theory? We use it because if the market is efficient and the statement is public, then someone who bought over the market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the false statement.     I mean, that's -- so he -- there was sufficient reliance indirectly. All right.     So I think his point is, yes, I can see materiality is something that's relevant to everybody.     Of course, it is, a common issue in the case.     But also, it is a feature of materiality that, if it wasn't material, then our theory of market reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the window because you can have all the efficiency in the world, all the publicity in the world, but still, where something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his reaction is "who cares?"     And therefore, although there could be special cases, the efficient market theory plays no role. Now, I think that's what his theory is, if I understand it.     And -- and I don't hope it is, if I've got it -- I mean, I hope I got it right.     But -- but if that -- so what's your direct answer to that?       All right.     So you're saying, in this kind of case, the -- the materiality or not is not likely to be specially sufficient -- specially significant.     In fact, you are going to decide if it is a common issue, and there is no reason to import that common issue into the preliminary finding, even if what I just parroted, we hope, is true.       Right.     So if I've got this, your answer -- which I am trying to follow it; don't tell me I'm right if I'm not -- that, with efficiency of the market, that's not a traditional element of a tort --       -- that is something special to get into this theory.       The publicity of the matter, that is not traditionally a common element of the tort.     That is something special to get into this theory.       With materiality, it is a common element of the tort always; it is traditionally there; it will be litigated, so there is no special reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at the outset.       They are preconditions -- they are preconditions, not related to the merits, that do, in fact, justify the use of a special reliance theory.     Now, I've said that; of course, so is materiality.       But materiality, unlike the other two, is part of the element of the basic case, where it is a common issue in this case -- and in most -- to everybody.       Is that exactly right? Because I am getting the -- facing the problem a few minutes from now, somebody is going to say, well, why is that exactly right?     I mean, it is a precondition.
11-1118 +++$+++  
11-1160 +++$+++        Your point -- I don't mean to interrupt, but the point that he's making in response to my earlier questions along these lines, I think, was the following:     Where do they get their hospitals, these authorities?     The -- the law sets up a hospital authority.     All right.     Where did they get their hospitals?       Well, do you know what actually happened?    Do you -- do you know, in fact, where these hospital authorities got their hospitals from?      So I want to know where did they get their hospitals?      I don't need to know all of them.     I just want some rough idea where do they come from.      You may not know.       Yes.       Okay.       Okay.     I've got it.     I've got it.     Then --       Then he says this       He says, I have been thinking of it the wrong way.     I have been thinking of it like the California State Public Utilities Commission.     They regulate all the electricity producers.     That isn't this.       These were a group of people that ran some hospitals -- some municipal hospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general. They have a lot of power there to acquire other hospitals from outside the system. But, when they do that, there's no reason to think that that gives them the power to acquire it, where it's anticompetitive.       Now, the fact that you can regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one group, doesn't say that you have to bring in anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in others, where they're anticompetitive.     That -- that, I think, is his point.       Don't think of it as one thing; think of it as two separate systems.       No, no.     I know that.     But once you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see, they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals, they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that for non-authority, even though they might have the power to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why read this as saying you can bring them in, where it's anticompetitive to do so?       And they -- they say on that, that it's a sham.     Well, just say 30 seconds on their argument, that the FTC looked into it, these people had never regulated anything, they'd never looked at any price anywhere, they've never done a single thing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it. What about that?
11-1175 +++$+++       Suppose you're right.    What about their policy argument here, that you're a -- you're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of money, you don't have a lot of money, and the deal is this, under your interpretation, if you win, you're going to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose, it will cost you about a thousand. That's -- that's under your interpretation.       And under theirs, it's if you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least you don't lose anything.      Oh, it could be worse.       Now, what about the -- how does this work, the canon?     I'm very interested.       I'm very interested in canons, and I want to know on the canon, the traditional thing, which you've probably looked up, what about the specific governs the general?     Is it -- how is that -- that's an old canon that's been around a long time, and people are aware of it.     And that's --       This is -- it seems to be the one they feel is very important.       Yes.     Well, that's what I'm interested in.       Well, that -- that's a different matter.
11-1221 +++$+++        Well, why do you resist - I'm just curious.     I -- I would have thought that to answer Justice Alito you were going to say the answer is it isn't more accurate.     If you write a will and say I want these proceeds now to go to my second wife, that is a better expression of the person's intent.     But if you open that door, you'll get other wills that aren't quite so clear.     And that's the problem that Congress faced.       Is that right?       If he is right, if the only consideration that led Congress to make this absolute rule and so forth the underlying the previous holdings, if the only consideration were ease of administration by the Federal administrator, this statute wouldn't undermine it.     So -- so isn't that true? I mean, the Federal administrator writes the check to the person that's on the list.     This is a matter after the check gets mailed, or this doesn't undermine it at all, there is no problem.       I mean, that's what we have to make up in order to -       Is there anything else?       Well, maybe we should say, look, this is a statute that is absolute.     There is no interest.     All this does is run around, without being too pejorative, it runs around the earlier cases, which is your basic point.     It's absolute.       Right.
11-1231 +++$+++        Well, but you have three -- the point that you make is right, that -- that you have specific language in the beneficiary part and not here; but you have the other way, the point that Justice Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is -- is -- doesn't say file within 180 days.     It says, you may have a hearing if you file within 180 days.     It doesn't say what happens if you don't.     It's open, the language. And the -- the subject matter is not a court.     The subject matter is a rather technical agency review board.     And normally, I would think, you would think, and members of Congress would think that the agency knows best as to how to run its own operation and -- and don't interfere too much in details, and this is a sort of detail. So those are the things against you, it seems to me, though the thing you cite is certainly for you.       One was passed long, long ago and was part of the Social Security Act or something, the one you're talking about, and was passed many years before the second one was passed. And when they're sitting in Congress writing -- you know, they don't know everything that was passed in history.       Are there examples?     I mean, it seems to me that, even if you lose this -- I mean, I mentioned the three arguments against you, the other -- the ambiguity of the language and so forth.     So if it ends up, even though it's not just a lawyer's argument, it isn't really that clear, and they do have some authority, you then have the second string, which is you say their rule is unreasonable because it has an absolute 3-year cutoff, instead of a little flexibility there for fraudulent concealment. So -- so do you have statutes, are there statutes that say 3 -- or are there cases that say 3 years is not enough, that -- that you have to have more than 3 years?     I thought 3 years is a pretty long time. I mean, I guess they can't go back to fraudulent concealment pre-Civil War -- you know, I mean, there's some period that must be reasonable to cut everything off, and what is that period?     What do the cases say? If it isn't 3 years, what is it?       That's their view there, and their view here, which is a different kind of thing, is that 3 years is enough.     The question is, is that reasonable?     And do you have any authority that says it's unreasonable?       So what about -- then let's get back to the question I really meant to ask before -- you know, assuming they have some authority here to write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is not reasonable in this situation.     So what is?       I mean, you want to go back to the Civil War?     I mean, let's imagine you really have the strongest possible case.     All the records burned up, and it took 5 years for scientists to reproduce the records by putting charred pieces of paper together. Okay?     So you couldn't possibly bring your claim until they finished.     That's a pretty equitable claim.     5 years okay?     10?     What is the -- 100?     I mean, what?       But what I hear you saying is go back to the Revolutionary War.     If it took 100 years to put the papers together, you're saying no time limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases or misconduct cases.     You've got to have some exception in there forever.       Is that right?     If that is your position, I just want to know.       Okay.     And by the way, do we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give the agency's own determination some weight?       Yes.     They'll come in and say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause here because we weren't that awful.     And now, does the judge give them some weight?
11-1274 +++$+++        Now, that's the question because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute; it is a statute that applies to all government actions, which is a huge category across the board and it's about years old. And until 2004 I haven't found a single case in which the government ever tried to assert the discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard in the 19th century where they did make that assertion. They were struck down by the district court, and the attorney general in his opinion said, the district court's absolutely right; of course, the government cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations where what they're trying to do is to gather something that's so close to a criminal case. So my question is:     Is there any case at all until the year 2004, approximately, in which the government has either tried or certainly succeeded in taking this general statute and applying the discovery rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to enforce the law for the civil penalty? The reason I brought up Social Security, Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases. And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming from, which isn't so different from the -- from the questions that have been put to you.       All I'm asking you for is one case.       No, it is not a problem of fairly recent vintage.     I'd say for 200 years there is no case.     The only case, as far as I have been able to discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the government to assert a civil penalty.     That's what created the problem.     Before that there was no problem; it was clear the government couldn't do it. All right.     Now, you will tell me that I'm wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong.     And that's what I'm asking.     I want to be told I'm wrong, sort of. (Laughter.)       No, I haven't found one.       I mean, we are asking the same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude there is none.     What I want is a case before the year in which the government sought a civil penalty and was not trying to recover money or land that it had lost, and I want the name of that case in which they said that the discovery rule applies. The two that you cited, Amy and the case of Broderick's Will, did involve the government being injured by losing land or losing money, something like that.     So I have those and I don't think they count, but I will look at them again.     Is there anything else you would like to refer me to?       The reason would be that the -- you know, once you start talking about applying this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare, for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody who did commit some fraud and they kept the money.     You know, she had five children not four, or she has five, not six.     And I can understand it being fair when the government catches her -- you know, 18 years later, they say, We want our money back.     Okay.     I say that's fair, not necessarily merciful, but fair. But then to go and say, and in addition we want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we couldn't have discovered it.     Don't you know there are 4 million people who get Social Security or 40 million or something, and we can't police every one.     And so suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to getting your money back, but to also you're having what looked like criminal penalties years later without much benefit of a statute of limitations. That is at the back of my mind.     And I'd like to know, having brought it up front, what -- what your response is.       That's right.      But this is not the securities context.    This is the context of -- that's why I started down the road I was down.      Yes, because you have two people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt. For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the statute of limitations and Congress focused on this. And it wrote a two-tier statute.    And it wrote a two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned about the problem you mention.    You have a victim.    So you're either going to let the defendant keep the money or the victim gets it back.    I understand that, but this is not that context.    This is like a criminal context, where not only are you getting your money back, but you also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty.    And in that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't understand why the government is so anxious to change what has long been the apparent --       That's correct, you have a fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can get your money back.       Oh, no, your case--       Well, if all that's true, and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am right about this point, but remember your banking case now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply?     That is, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative action to hide what's going on, the statute will be tolled.     Is that right?       All right.     As long as that's right, then in all your banking cases, there are bank inspectors all over these banks, I hope -- you know, about once a month or so --       -- or once a year.     And so the chance of there -- the chance of this somehow escaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which would allow the government to extend the toll strikes me as small, but am I right?       I thought it was the opposite.     In other words, I thought both parties, for purposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent concealment has nothing to do with it.     We are not to consider fraudulent concealment.       Am I right when I say that?       I assume that we are on the same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean, I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent concealment.     I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable estoppel, would you?       No, no, no.     I mean -- I mean, there's nothing -- (Laughter.)       If we were to say -- if we -- if the Court were to hold, it seemed to me, and this is again tentative to get your response, but if the -- if the Court were to hold the discovery doesn't -- rule doesn't apply, there's nothing in that that says equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in that that says equitable estoppel doesn't apply, nothing in that that says fraudulent concealment doesn't apply. Now, you've shaken me a little bit on the fraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other two.       Oh, not the equitable estoppel.       Equitable estoppel, the person comes in and says, oh, yes, I'll tell you all about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a statute of limitations defense, I promise.     And the Court says, hey, you just asserted one, you can't.
11-1285 +++$+++        Why -- why is it so unfair? I've been putting it in a way that looks unfair, which favors your side.     But US Air or the equivalent says, now, here is the deal, we'll pay your medical expenses. And now, if somebody causes those expenses, you come to us, and we decide whether we want to sue and get our expenses back, and any extra money, we give to you, and we pay our attorneys' fees extra.     They don't count against the fund. And if our lawyers tell us it isn't worth it, you're free to sue; but, I'll tell you what, your lawyer is going to be at the end of the queue.     We're first, then comes your lawyer, and anything left over goes to you. Now, if you can find a lawyer that takes it on those conditions, good for you.     But he might because he might think he's going to get -- but our lawyers have already told us it's not going to work, so that's the situation. Now, what's -- I'm not -- I think US Air's point would be, well, what's unfair about that? That's -- that makes sure we get our money back.     That's what we want to do.     And you're free to sue; it's just your lawyer who's going to come at the end of the queue, okay? What's -- why is that unfair?       Enter best case -- what is your best case?     I'd love to find it.     There's a case that says something like this.       Well -- well, let me tell you what I'm thinking of.     The -- there is a contract, all written down.     They forgot to put a seal on it. They forgot to put a seal on it.     So I guess it's now 1463 or some year like that.     So they go into equity. And now, they are in equity.     And the plaintiff says, judge, I want you to enforce this contract.     He says, I'm a judge in equity.     He says, I know, but we've agreed, and you enforce it in equity. The contract says, give Smith all the wheat. And equity says -- you know, there are other people who would like some of this wheat, too, so we are not going to follow the contract.     We are going to modify the contract according to equitable principles, which, as you say, they can do.     And the other side says, no, they wouldn't.     They'd follow the contract.     They are just in equity because they forgot the seal. Okay.     What is your best case to show they did, indeed, modify it with the common fund doctrine or some other doctrine?     I want to be sure to read it with a magnifying glass.       I know, but I didn't ask you about what they found.     I was asking what you found.
11-1327 +++$+++        Now -- now, I take it you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so -- because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough evidence, and so the prosecutor thinks, I think I'd like to try him again, and then he's acquitted again.     I'd like to try him again, and he's acquitted again. Now, substitute judge for jury, the same thing could happen.     I mean, I don't see why not.     And there's no answer to that, is there?     And if there's no answer to that, the same bad thing could happen.     Well, then you're going to have to start distinguishing among which judge or jury acquittals do or do not invoke the problem of the Double Jeopardy Clause. And where I'm driving is that -- that there is a principle, and the principle was -- it seems the simplest way to put it, is where in fact the acquittal rests upon a judgment that there isn't enough evidence, that's it.     That's what we're after.     And where it's some procedural thing or not, maybe we aren't.     Okay. Now, the virtue of that is it's simple, it's consistent with the cases, it's been clear.     And you're advocating, let's go into that and change it or at least interpret the cases that's consistent with it.     And we're saying there wasn't enough evidence, is because the judge had in mind a legal point that he was wrong about, then Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't work.     But if the judge was right, it does work.     Well, except for the matter of substantive evidence.     Now, that way, as your opponent, lies a mess. I just went through that long thing because I don't want you to get -- sit down without addressing what I see as a central problem, namely, if we don't accept his view, it's going to be a terrible mess.       Now, you're beginning to make distinctions.       And once you make those distinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which was there is a distinction.     The distinction is whether it's a procedural ground or -- and Justice Harlan's -- it's whether there was -- "Just talk to the U.S. attorney, I didn't like it," or "Talk to the witness," or "The prosecution brought too late." The other side of it, where the clause attaches, is where it was done on a substantive basis, not enough evidence.     I said -- I don't want to repeat myself, but I'm saying what he's coming up with is a simple, clear rule, basically consistent with the cases, and why shouldn't we follow it?       Let's go through this.     My basic question:     Normally, a judge will wait till the jury comes in and then decide, if the jury convicts him, whether to set it aside.     So there's no problem.     So now, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in the middle of the case. Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope. And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing down his reasons.     So he might just say there isn't enough evidence.     And now, it happens that, just before he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an erroneous theory.     All right.     An added element or something or other, some kind of misconstruction of this.     What happens then?       Yes.     But this a judge, after all, who for some reason -- we don't know what -- decided, instead of waiting, as they normally would do, grant it in the middle of the case.       Oh, I see.     So there are a lot more places --       They do.     They --       And then this is a --       This has arisen a lot more than -- than I think. All right.     Fine.     Thank you.       And in that case, do they have to write it down?       So then, in other words, when an acquittal --       Can you add to that -- your -- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in the last 30 or 40 years?     Have most U.S. prosecutors or prosecutors in these states thought that they could appeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law?
11-1347 +++$+++        I don't think that's -- you've won a judgment in lower court that says that the habitual residence of the child is Scotland.     So if they appeal, they might win one that says that was wrong, the habitual residence was the United States, but the child is in Scotland. You understand Scottish law better than I, but they are also bound by this treaty.     So I would imagine a Scottish court, just as we would do, when they are trying to decide what's the habitual presumptive then, and now, what's the habitual residence, they would look at what the United States courts decided. They are not absolutely bound by it.     But just as we, in the last case we had, were very interested in what the Chilean courts said.     Of course, it was relevant to us what the Chilean courts had held was the proper law of Chile in respect to that child. Wouldn't the Scottish courts do the same? Wouldn't it matter to a Scottish court, after all, that an American court had decided that the residence was not bound?     I'd certainly give it  wont they give it consideration?       I'm assuming they win.     The reason that they want to appeal is they want to win.     If I were looking at the case as you present it, I would say, of course, you'll win, don't worry.     What are you worried about? But -- but they have a different view.     So they think they are going to win.     Now, it means nothing if they lose.     But if they win on appeal, they then have their order that says that this child's habitual residence was the United States.     And my question is where we started, armed with that piece of paper, they walk into the Scottish court and they say, oh, Scottish judge, please read this paper. Of course, he will read it, and I would think that that judge would take it into account in his decision.     That's what we do with the foreign -- similar foreign orders of other foreign courts, and I think we should do that, and I think the Scottish courts should and will.     Now, you tell me where I'm wrong in that.       Or -- then argument as to why they shouldn't give in to this hypothetical American judgment.     That isn't my question.     My question is won't they consider it and give it -- and the Scottish courts, to my knowledge, are not so narrow-minded.     I think they would pay attention to what other courts have said.       Am I right or wrong?     I want to know if I'm right or wrong.       They would?       Well, thank you for Justice Ginsburg's answer.     She is quite helpful. (Laughter.)       I was there, but I didn't understand it as fully, and now, I do.       Unless there is some accommodation here, what worries me is this:     If you win this case, it's not going to be better.     Maybe for your client, it will be, but for others in your position, it's not going to be better. And what's worrying me, to put it on the table, so you can respond, is that, in similar situations, district judges will think this child belongs in England; this child belongs in France; this child belongs in China, wherever they belong.     But in the back of their mind will be the possibility that they are wrong, and they know there is a right to appeal. And so instead of being able in these border cases -- borderline cases, instead of being able to send the child back home, they will think, I've got to keep the child here, so that the other party has the right to appeal.     Now, it seems to me, in general, that would be bad for the child.     It would be -- and it's bad for our system. And it would be better to work out a system that you can send the child back, and then if you're reversed on appeal, it does matter to the other country's courts.       But I can't -- I don't understand why you want a treaty where the best interest of the child is what's at issue, and you interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with the child, where you have parents from both nations, pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations are saying. I mean, my experience out of that is Chile, where, of course, we wanted to know what the law of Chile was and how the Chilean domestic relations judge understood the relations between the parents.     That was important. And similarly, I think the Scottish judge should want to know the same thing about the courts deciding in the United States.     And the same thing is true of the United States judge wanting to know about Scotland and so forth. I don't see how we're going to get harmony, in other words, unless you let appellate processes go forward, too.     And -- and I don't know what the treaty drafters would have had in mind if they wanted some other regime.       I trust Scotland to do the right thing.     And I think, to help Scotland do the right thing, it would be nice for Scotland to know what American judges have decided.     That's all.     And the reverse is equally true.       It does equate, but now, you've got me -- I think I'm on the same wavelength.       And I think it was back just as well, let me see, because Justice Ginsburg -- I see the point of her answer now. It's really fact-specific to this case that you're talking about.     So it just happens that the child has now been in Britain or in Scotland for 18 months. And so the question of current habitual residence where they have been there for 18 months is a question of what's been happening over these 18 months, and what happened before the 18 months has absolutely nothing to do with it. And the most that the court of appeals could say is that it was resident in America 18 months ago, and that's no more relevant than saying that the cow jumped over the moon or some other thing.     Is has -- is that the point?     Is that the point?     Is that the point?       If that's the point -- yes, that is the point.     Okay.     If that's the point --       Well, the Convention doesn't know whether it's 18 months or 6 months or what counts as habitual residence, does it?       That's true, but you have to decide whether that's the habitual residence.     And it seems to me that you're adding a factual thing, that what happened in 18 months earlier has nothing to do with whether the child is now a habitual resident of Scotland. And what I want to know -- and I'm not going to find this in the treaty, I don't think, because it's not going to say whether it's 11 months or 12 -- but I want to know what source I look to, to show that you're right and that what happened 18 months previously has nothing to do with the child's habitual residence as of the place where he has lived for 18 months.       Yes.     Fact.       Yours is fact.     I want to know what I look to, to find out that fact.
11-1351 +++$+++        You're -- you're -- I'm picking up from -- I find Justice Scalia's hypothetical interpretations of legislative history very useful. So the -- the -- and I -- (Laughter.)       Because there are a lot of words in these things.     And -- and so given all these words and -- this is where the Chief Justice started -- I mean, can't we at least look at legislative history, to try to figure out what Congress was doing by the time we get to the exception to the exception to the exception?       Yes.       Well, then you win, as long as I find it confusing. (Laughter.)       Well, I don't find it all that confusing.     What it says is that this battery exception, which is in (h), is not supposed to apply when we look at the military doctors.     That's what it says.       And if -- and you say, ah, but it says, "for purposes of this section."     Okay.     I look at "for purposes of this section," and the purposes of this section -- the very first whole sentence has to do with 1089.     It has to do with the scope.     It has to do with the general waiver.       Okay.     But why?     Why would they have wanted to do that?     That is to say, look, if you cut the exception to the exception to the exception, the presumption, da, da, da, out of it, what we've got on your interpretation is that a person who's hurt by a battery committed by a government official, given your interpretation, has no remedy at all.     I mean, previously, he could have at least sued in State court.       Now, what you're saying is Congress tried to do with this language is say, hey, you can't sue in State court; and, by the way, when you try to sue the Federal government, we are not going to give you your suit, either.     Why do that?       Would you -- are you finished there?       Would -- would you go back for a minute and think, before this Act was passed -- the Gonzalez Act -- and think of the millions of government employees, and they're in different parts of the country, and some of them commit batteries. Now, you told me before that, where an injured person -- a plaintiff sues a government employee, and they sue under State tort law, and they say, this government employee committed a battery, okay, in the course of duty, you say there was an immunity there. Where did the immunity come from?       From what?       I mean, what was the theory of it?     I mean, here it's just -- it's a person, he's at work, he does happen to work for the Federal government, instead of working for someone else --       -- and everybody else, you have to respond, and you -- if liable, you'd have to pay damages for the battery.     Now, where -- where did the immunity come from --       -- if the Federal employee did it?       Why?
11-139 +++$+++        I agree with you on that. The -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, actually.     There are many different kinds of ambiguity, and the question is, is this of the kind where the agency later would come and use its expertise?     And you're saying here it was up to the Congress and looking at what they had in mind. All right.     Maybe that's the base -- best ground, but suppose it turns out a majority think you're not right on that.     Okay?     Now, here's my question: Assuming you're wrong on that, which I'm not sure you are, but assuming you're wrong, now we get to this regulation.     Here is my problem:     One -- I have no doubt at some level it seems rather unfair, but that instinct is not enough.     The question is what -- what's the law? (A) You can say the word "open" doesn't include this case.     But we run into the problem that an agency has great authority to construe its own regulation. (B) You could say that, well, there's this statute out there that says don't apply it, and there are two routes there.     One is something to do with language, which I think you can think of, which seems to cut very much against you if read naturally, but you can strain it to read it in your favor.     And the other has to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although they left it out of their brief and they put in ellipses, I can see why they left it out because when you read it it's again ambiguous.     We run into the same problem. Then you could say:     Well, they're not supposed to do these things retroactively, either on common law administrative law grounds or something like that; they shouldn't do it; it's unfair. And they'll say:     But, you see, it wasn't that unfair; a child of 2 would have known this was a loophole.     That's how they would have characterized it. And the IRS never said anything, except for one district director in a different district that really encouraged or underwrote this kind of thing.     So, it's not nearly as unfair as you think.     If you live by loopholes, you'll die by regulation.     You know, something like that. So, looking at those four possible grounds -- and I can't think of a fifth -- you take your choice. Which is the strongest, and how do you apply to the -- reply to the objection?       "Open," that's the term.
11-1425 +++$+++        I thought the question was if -- if in fact the person won't agree to a breathalyzer.       Was your client was offered the breathalyzer twice?       How many times?       I mean, aside from all -- the thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind, is, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a neutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to act as a second judgment on that; it would make it less likely that people who are really innocent, in fact, have this happen to them and so forth. But they're arguing that that's a -- that's a considerable burden in many, but not all States.     And at some point -- and the addition in respect to the second judgment, namely the magistrates that you get, is not worth really what you're going to lose, which are going to be people who are drunk driving around on roads and -- and possibly killing people.     We all know how that side can be built up, too.       So at some point, I would wish you would spend some time addressing that, that practical argument.       A lot of States have varying degrees to which they want to enforce strict rules against drunk driving.     And a State -- that's exactly the kind of thing that worries me on your side. The -- you have a bunch of States that don't -- you know, it's not easy to get hold of a magistrate in minutes or so forth.     And so what to do about that? If you say, well, you don't have to because you haven't got it provided, you give them every incentive not to make the magistrate available.     That's cutting in your favor.     On the other hand, it's pretty tough to say that all these States have to have the best possible magistrate available 24 hours a day so somebody can call in ten instances a year because the guy won't take the blood test -- won't take the breathalyzer. And that's where I am in a dilemma.     And so I'm looking for an answer to that.     And you don't have an absolute rule or I don't see an absolute rule. Should you say, look, here's what you have to do, it's better to have a second opinion there, which is the magistrate's? And so on the way to the hospital, it's just that's where we started, you have to phone and try to get one, and if you don't have one by the time you're at the hospital, tell them again:     It's your last chance, give us the breathalyzer or else.     And he says no, then you take the blood test.     Is that the solution, or do you have a better solution?     What's the solution to the problem if you are willing to reject, which you aren't, but hypothetically you might be, that there's the absolute rule.       My question is what you don't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think of a second-best solution it might always be better than what I think of as a second-best solution.       I -- I want to know if you want to say anything that would suggest -- we have a number of them floating around and -- and I just wonder if you want to express any view on a second-best solution.       I am probably just -- but a policeman has probable cause to believe that somebody inside the house has drugs.     He hears the toilet flushing and he thinks they're flushing the drugs down the drain.       He doesn't have to get a warrant as long as he reasonably believes that the evidence is disappearing.     All right.     Now, the difference between your case here and that is specifically what?     Suppose we were just to refer to those cases --       -- and say it's the same thing.
11-1447 +++$+++        So that -- am I wrong about -- I might have this -- I thought the framework, roughly, is the following:     it is not the case that Penn Central applies only where there is a physical invasion of property, or there is total destruction of the value of the property. In those two situations, what we said in Lucas is it applies without case-specific inquiry, but there are another set of cases where Penn Central and MCMahon apply with case-specific inquiry. And those, to discover whether you have one, you look into such things as whether the regulation destroys investment-backed expectations.     And then you look to the nature of the government interest and the relationships, et cetera.     That's what I thought the framework was. Now, if that's the framework, then, when the government says, I will let you develop your land if and only if you give $50,000 to the Shriners Hospital, you would say, I can't develop my land.     And, besides, that significantly interferes with my investment-backed expectations.     And, besides, there is no relation whatsoever.     Therefore, I win under the Takings Clause. Now, I spell all that out because I -- if I'm wrong about that framework -- if I am right about the framework, that can apply to this case.     If I am wrong about the framework, I want to know where in the cases I'm wrong.       Okay.     So, if I'm right about the framework, that takes care of all the hypotheticals you were asked.     In those cases, there is a significant interference with investment-backed expectation.     And there's no justification whatsoever, so the Takings Clause applies.       No, no.     Why isn't the answer, yes, it is applicable?     Of course, it's applicable.     I own a piece of land, and they have significantly interfered with my investment-backed expectation.       And -- and to say that I can't put a house on this because I'm supposed to pay for a football field, which has nothing to do with it, is as close to insisting that you have to have 4,000 columns of coal in your mine, so that you can never use it, as I can think of.     It's Holmes brought up-to-date.       I mean, at least that argument would be made --       And why wouldn't it be a winning argument?       Yes, I agree with you --       Well, what he's going to say, in part, is -- I guess, I did a little numbers from your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about 4 million are bodies of water and say a third of them are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland and 11 million that aren't.     That's crude. So they're saying why in heaven's name are we supposed to -- everybody wants to build.     And why should the people that happen to live in wetland have to pay for all the other wetland?     That's just coincidence. So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners Hospital.     You are going to say, no, it isn't like the Shriners Hospital. Now, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an issue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't?       I know you'll say that.     He will say that it is.
11-1450 +++$+++        That's the same question.       If so, this is just a loophole because it swallows up all of Congress's statute, which is what their problem is, all you have to do, even if you were less obvious than the Chief Justice's example, what you do is you -- you file a complaint, you say it's for $4,900,000; in fact, it's worth 10 million.     But you inform people, unlike Justice Alito, you figure a way around his problem, you keep them informed, and you say, it's getting close, getting close. And once you are up to $4,800,000, the others get the word:     Stay out of it.     And once they stay out of it, you go ahead with your action and then those that stayed out of it becomes the subject of a second action.     And if it's for 50 million, then you have ten actions and then you have 20.     So, in fact, all that is required is a few extra pieces of paper that will soon become standardized, and a lot of postage stamps. And we have 30 or 40 or $50 million cases being tried in whatever counties Congress liked the least.     I gather they're some in Arkansas.     But that seems to be all behind Justice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions, and I would like to hear a pretty complete answer on that.       But what you said then in response -- we're on the same subject, and I'm drawing the conclusion from what you say that yes, we've found a way around this.     And what we're going to do is we will divide our $25 million class action into six subsidiary actions and proceed exactly the same merry way.     And we do that by means of stipulation. Now, your words in the statute do favor that, in my opinion, at the moment.     But the purpose seems to strongly cut the other way.     And I do see a way to go the other way, in that you could say, given the purpose of this, the words do mean something different, and they do mean you should aggregate the real value of the real amounts that the class is likely to have. Now, it's capable of that reading, and the virtue of that reading is that it would stop what looks like, from what you're saying, a mechanical method of avoiding the purpose of the statute.     I say that explicitly because I really want to make it as much as possible that you will focus in on what's a response to that.       What about -- what about, has anyone thought of this -- I hate to bring up sort of a new idea, but somebody may have thought of it. Imagine we're now in the Federal district court.     And the Federal district court reads the statute because the case has just been removed.     And he says -- you know, this -- this case would be worth a lot more than 5 million were it not for that stipulation. And let now me look at that stipulation. That stipulation is a part of some, let's call it, "monkey business," which you will resist that, but I mean by that to -- to encompass the kinds of things we've been talking about, that there are going to be five similar class actions, that they're going to take the people A through K, that they're going to -- anything like that. And he says that's not under this statute the kind of stipulation that Congress meant to bar my consideration of the $5 million.     So if it's a manipulative stipulation, whatever that might be, it doesn't bar me as the district judge from aggregating up to -- beyond 5 million, but if it's not manipulative, fine.     Has there -- has there been any thought on that kind of --       Well, but there might be -- there might be ways of working with this notion, a little risky from your point of view, but there might be ways of working with this good faith notion so that some -- there would be some power in the Federal district court to set aside certain stipulations which were used for manipulative purposes and what the definition of that manipulative is something that isn't clear to -- to me at the moment.     But --
11-1518 +++$+++        Oh, yes.     Wait, wait.     You say -- you mean either, both?     I mean, there is no doubt here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned. It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional.     So you don't have to worry about that one. Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd like to hear your answer to.     I thought it might have come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take it, that there has to be an element in which the person not only knows what he has done, but that he does it with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and then fill in the blanks, or?       All right.     Then if that's your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement and larceny are set off.     These two concern fraud and defalcation in respect to the trust.     There is a case of this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust requires an element of moral turpitude. That suggests a knowledge that what you are doing violates the law.     And if we read in pari materia, we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed more so.     Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in respect to embezzlement, which is outside the parenthesis.       Why?     Defalcation on your definition would seem to be more likely to be thought innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances than would fraud.       No.     It may mean, for example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was you took some money that belonged to the trust given by your father to help your mother.     And your mother says, help me, and the brothers and sisters will benefit well too.     And so you go to your insurance guy and he says, sure, no problem.     And then, lo and behold, they did it. I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct was as described. (Laughter.)       Is it -- before we leave this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a picture of they're being innocent.     But we are in a court that this Court has described as a court of equity or akin thereto.       One principle I used to learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity, but not anybody else. Now, we have two lower courts that are saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least they don't understand it.     That this, the other client tried to get him to sell the property, but they write the properties are abandoned and uninsurable.     Even though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't sell it. And so do you have clean hands?     Not you yourself.     You didn't take the money and you do not have dirty hands, all right? But did your client here, does he lack clean hands because two courts have said he should have just sold his collateral and he would have gotten the money and saved everybody a lot of trouble?       Because?       Did we remand it so they could?       And then what's the loss? I mean, let's assume the trust was worth $1 million plus percent, and every year, they have in their coffer $1 million plus 6 percent.       The only part they don't have is the extra money that the trustee made, that there is no cutting down of the size of the trust.     At least that's an argument.     Now, what's the answer?       Because?       Because?     I mean, I thought defalcation is -- supposes that the person does pack his suitcases with the money and he goes and shows up in Rio.     I take it that would be defalcation.     That isn't fraud.       But you didn't cite to the Latin, did you?       But you didn't have the Latin definition, which I take it from my colleague and it was confirmed by my law clerks, it comes from medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction.       What about the other argument?     I just don't want you to leave without addressing the other argument.       In your brief you talk about and quote "Learned Hand" and say it means -- "If it doesn't mean a deliberate malversation," said Learned Hand -       -- then it must be the same as fraud or embezzlement.     So I will go look up "malversation" as soon as I return to my office, and I will get that. Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a loss.     Two, done deliberately, but with an innocent state of mind because he didn't understand the law. Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision requires some degree of moral turpitude.     Well, that suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to knowledge that it's against the law.     What about that?
11-1545 +++$+++        Well, what worries me about it is you -- you and I both have, in our offices, thousands of words which are in the U.S. Code, and there are hundreds of thousands -- or millions of employees, in millions of different kinds of agencies, and, if we turn Chevron into the tax code, it's going to be a nightmare -- in my opinion, not necessarily in that of my colleagues. So, as you know, I've written somewhat a different approach.     And it says, let's not do this. But just so, who would win here?     Suppose you just said, look, what we're interested in is just one question, whether Congress wanted a court to give, in this kind of situation, deference to the agency.     And the answer will be, it depends.     Chevron is a good rule of thumb, but it isn't a straightjacket. So what you'd look at here is it's the FCC that is in charge of national communications, of which this is part.     There is a specific provision, as your colleague points out, that says, "but don't interfere with the States when they are citing stuff." But then there is a limitation to that specific provision, which consists of six or seven parts, all of which maintain a lot of authority in the FCC or rules about what they are not supposed to do. And then, here, it uses the word "reasonable." So where you have a Federal agency with expertise that's in charge of this kind of area and they have rule-making authority, and you have a statute like this, which is a little bit ambiguous, but not too, in respect to the point about whether they do interpretation, you'd add up those factors and make a decision.       I mean, that's such a simple -- I mean, that's Louis Jaffe.     That -- that's the founders of administrative law.     That's everybody until we get into a straightjacket.     And it isn't -- even Chevron doesn't go against us, if you don't think of it as a straightjacket.       I didn't make it up.     It was Louis Jaffe.       I mean, I think you can show, which I will spare you at the moment, all the cases like Meade are consistent with what I said.     And cases that are not consistent are consistent with what Judge Friendly said years ago, where he said there is no coherence to the Supreme Court's cases in this area; when they like a result, they say they have deference, and, when they don't like it, they say they don't.       You don't have to -- I'm sorry I brought this up. (Laughter.)       Okay.     Now --       I -- I dissented in that, I think.       Right.     And so I agree with you, this flows a fortiori from the majority. But I didn't think -- and this is what I wonder -- is -- you say unelected Federal bureaucrats. Administrative law is about Federal administration. That is Federal administrative law. And I've heard, here, people say we're talking about them adding something.     I didn't think that's what was at issue.     I thought that there is a word in the statute, "reasonable," and what the administrators did at the FCC was to interpret that word.     Am I right or wrong?       What was added?     What was added?       Reasonable -- reasonable is uncertain who.     Who has -- it doesn't tell us who had the authority.
11-159 +++$+++        The question is what -- you haven't mentioned the text that suggests you're not right, which is right in (h) which says:     In determining whether an applicant is a child of an insured, the Commissioner shall apply such law as intestacy law. Okay?     That's what it says.     Now, how do you get out of that?       Because you say, well, there's an implicit exception.       You're saying that that doesn't apply.     And so, I've listened carefully to your reasons for saying why (h) doesn't apply when its language seems to say it does apply, and I'm not sure of why it doesn't apply.     I mean --       Suppose that two parents have lived together for 6 years and 4 months in State X, and they have a child.     Fine.     The father dies.     Were they married?     They never went through a ceremony.     Is there a common law marriage?     Might it depend on the State?     Do you know the answer in every State?     My answer is:     You don't know.     And I don't know.     And, therefore, we have to look to the law of the State in order to see whether that (e) is satisfied.     Now, we have to look to it to decide if they're married.     Even you say that. So, what Congress did is it found a pretty good shorthand way of saying where you look.     We're not going to worry about 6 years and 2 months; we're just going to look at their intestacy law.     That's, as I read it, what it seems to say. Now, I have been listening to you , and I don't see how you're going to save us from even worse problems, particularly when I started looking at the state of the artificial insemination and so forth, and every State has a dozen different variations. There are uniform acts.     There are things you have to acknowledge in writing.     It's a very complicated subject.     And -- and that's why I am rather hesitant to read it the way you want.     But I want you to reply to that.       Where is that sentence?       Is it the bottom of the paragraph?       It says, "Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking intestate property as a child or a parent shall be deemed such."       So?       At the bottom of the paragraph.       It's sort of like a -- you say there is no board of tax -- sorry.     I won't get into that.     But -- because they used the word "deemed."     Is that right?       That's the heart of your argument there.       Yes, all right.       Okay.       The obvious practical thing is --       -- is that -- that, you know, once you get beyond this and the child wasn't even -- if he's conceived -- or what the father could do, couldn't he just write a note and say this is my child even if it's conceived later, and then wouldn't he fall within one of these other exceptions, the exception for being acknowledged?       He has acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his son or daughter.     What about that one?       Does it?     It doesn't say it.     I mean, it seemed to me easier to work with that one than the one you're trying to work with.     But I -- I don't know.     You're the -- but -- but anyway, what I'm worried about here --       Okay.     What I'm actually worried about and want you to address is I just -- if we were to adopt what you said, what they're concerned about is many different applicants coming back later. That's what State intestacy is concerned about.     And you don't really know who their parents is.     Another thing is there are already children who are eating up all of the money.     And then some new person shows up, and you have to take the money away from the other children in order to give it to this new child.     And all the time, you don't know if that's what the parent who is dead really wanted. And so, that's why the States have gone into all kinds of writing requirements.     And -- and you want us to sort of -- applying this old law to new technology, just overlook those complications.
11-161 +++$+++        Then you're saying that the difference between the two classes is that if you continue to have the tax apply to the people who haven't paid it yet, there is a large administrative expense. And if you -- as an expense that does not exist in respect to the class that has already paid it. So, the question, I would have thought, in our Court is whether that's a rational distinction.     And I think contrary to what was suggested, administrative expenses, of course, make a difference where the Equal Protection Clause is concerned because they differentiate between the two classes.     And trying to avoid an administrative expense is a rational reason, normally, for making the distinction. Now, I mention that because I know -- what -- it can -- does that bring to mind any authority which would be helpful?     Because there was a question that there is no such authority.     It makes sense to me, but is there some authority for that?       What do you think would happen if the city says -- if it came out that way -- we really want to give refunds or cut off -- we want to stop collecting the money, period?     Then to make it fair on this hypothesis, the city would have to go back and refund money.     To whom?     And how many?       And you heard your -- your friend try to make a distinction between this project, and you wouldn't have to give the money, he said, to every other person, whoever back in 1850 or 1890 or whenever it was began to make Barrett Law payments.     But you would with this one. Now, what -- I'd like a little comment on that.       Right, because it's a question.       That's right -       Let me try to get my question, which is, I'm not -- I'm thinking this is project 1.     So, certainly, on the hypothesis, you have to pay back the people who already paid up for project 1.     But in your brief, you say there's project 2 through 20.     And is there, in your opinion, a basis for distinguishing all those people who have paid up in those projects, or would you have to give them their money back, too? Now, you heard your friend's statement - explanation of why you wouldn't have to give them the money back, and I want to get your response to that.       How many people does that involve, about?
11-166 +++$+++       What is -- I was just guessing before, but, I mean, if you're right, what is the (iii) -- the indubitable equivalent, what kind of situation does that come up? I mean, I was guessing it would come up, maybe an over secured creditor, they want to -- they want to sell the property, and he still wants his security, and they have to put in equivalent property that wasn't mortgaged, but I was just guessing.       So -- so what is it really -- what is it really used for, in your opinion?       What?       Yes, I'm sure.       That's what I was thinking.
11-182 +++$+++        Well, let's -- let me just go back because I think -- I'm trying to get focused the question, I think, others are asking.     And one way to focus it is the same question I asked Mr. Clement. Think of 2(B), the first sentence.     All right? Now, I can think -- I'm not saying they are right -- but, if that means you're going to hold an individual longer than you would have otherwise, I can think of some arguments that it is preempted and some replies.     So keep that out of it. Suppose that we were to say, that sentence, as we understand it, does not raise a constitutional problem as long as it is interpreted to mean that the policeman, irrespective of what answer he gets from ICE, cannot detain the person for longer than he would have done in the absence of this provision. Now, in your view, is there any preemption exemption -- argument against -- any preemption argument against that sentence as I have just interpreted it?     I don't know what your answer is, and that's why I'm asking.       And if so, what?       Look, in the Federal statute, it says in 1373 that nobody can prohibit or restrict any government entity from making this inquiry of the Federal government.     And then it says that the Federal government has -- any agency -- and then it says the Federal government has an obligation to respond. Now, assuming the statute were limited, as I say, so nothing happened to this individual, nothing happened to the person who's stopped that wouldn't have happened anyway, all that happens is the person -- the policeman makes a phone call.     Now, that's what I'm trying to get at. If that were the situation, and we said it had to be the situation, then what in the Federal statute would that conflict with, where we have two provisions that say any policeman can call?       What's the -- that's -- that's where I'm trying to push you.       Because, in my mind, I'm not clear what your answer is to that.
11-184 +++$+++        You don't have to read it that way, do you?     I mean, look, it says in (a), it says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely, and then it says "alleges that the basis for the action was discrimination," okay.     In that case the board shall within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action.     So they decided it.     They decided it was out of time.     They decided it was barred. They decided da, da, da. I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an issue that a person raises in court and we don't normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court. It decided it.     It decided it was untimely.       Oh, well, I see.     The issue.     They shall decide the issue of discrimination. I mean, you can read it as saying they have to decide the merits or you could read it as saying, there could be several claims that went on below.     Heard them, decide the discrimination one.     Now, you decide the discrimination one.     And I agree they used the word "issue" instead of saying decide the discrimination claim, that it says here, he alleges.     They could have said, decide the allegation.     They could have said, decide that part of the case. But, I mean, why do we want to jump over 14 hurdles to give this narrow interpretation to that word issue when all that's going to happen is we'll have a new jurisprudence arising. Is the dismissal on the ground that it was an allegation of discrimination, that it wasn't enough to really make out discrimination?     It was partial summary judgment.     It was a dismissal on the basis of the statement in the complaint.     It was -- I mean, we can think of 40 different things, perhaps, that are going to be hard to distinguish as to whether they're procedural, jurisdictional or on the merits. And why do we want to get courts into that, when the simplest thing is the person says, I allege discrimination.     There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of his paper.     The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on that particular one, and now we go to the district court.     That's just so simple.       Oh, no, no.     All we're doing is interpreting what you've said is the word issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he has raised that he was discriminated against.       Is there anything you want to say on the question of which is worse?     That is to say, I get your point on the word "issue," and I think you can read the word "issue" to say there is a contested point as to whether there was discrimination or to say there is a contested point between the parties as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a -- has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower -- the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination. The latter way favors your opponent, the former favors you; okay.     So we could do either, I guess. The one way, if you win, there will be a body of law about what counts as procedural and what doesn't.     That sounds confusing to me.     If you lose, I quite agree with you that there will then be different courts deciding different procedural matters, where you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit. Okay.     Do you have anything to say about which of those two evils is worse?     Is there any reason --       Have we any way of knowing?       -- going back to the language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think the language at best might be read, that word "issue," the way you say, but need not be.
11-192 +++$+++        So why do you care?     I mean, you're in the Northern District of Illinois, you bring a case under this Act.     I guess you lost because you wanted to appeal.     And so -- so what is the big deal?     Appeal to the Seventh Circuit.     Who cares.     Why do you care which circuit you go to?     You said you think -- well, why do you care?       I guess you and the Government could have stipulated, we agree it goes to the Seventh Circuit, and nobody would have opposed you on that.       This case is about you want to go to -- you want to go the Federal Circuit, they want you to go to the Seventh Circuit?       Okay.       Not in tort.     This seems an awful lot like a tort, or tell me why it isn't.     I mean, what you are saying is there's a statute that says you can't print more than the last five digits of a card or the date, the expiration date, and they did both and you want to say "or" means one or the other, it doesn't mean and/or.     That's what the case is about fundamentally, right?       Yes, can you do and/or or or.     All right, got it.     Now, if you print -- in your view of it, they printed too much about a person's credit card.       It sounds like an -- sort of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a tort.       What do you mean?     You can sue for -- in other words, if the statute were to say, if Smith, a Government employee, assaults a person, he gets damages.     Federal statute.     Now he brings a claim -- I don't know this law; I'm asking, I'm not arguing.     The plaintiff sues the United States for assault.     And you're saying that they can bring that in the Court of Claims because it's a statute. I don't know how this law works.     I just read that and I know the language doesn't totally tell you.     It's about liquid, illiquid.     I didn't get that part exactly.     But as I've understood it, you can't bring a tort suit in the Court of Claims.     Now, that's what I would like you to elaborate, because this sounds rather like a tort suit, not sort of.     That's why I am asking.       Even if it says you may not assault someone.       And the case I should look at to show that is what?     That's all right if you don't have it.       Well, I mean, the -- a lot of these provisions are technical, like the one I think is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the Government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble damages, does it?       Minimum damage, punitive damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations compared to the court of claims.       2 years.     And they have 6 in the other?       My -- my impression was there are several differences.     And normally, these things you, at least arguably, are not appropriate against the Government, because the Government when it knows the law will follow it, we hope.     And, therefore, you don't need brow-beating mechanisms to make sure they follow it once it's clarified.     So, therefore, it -- I mean, I can imagine arguments. At the same time, there are differences between the relief scheme in this statute and the normal one you have in the Court of Claims.     And they're arguing that that means that they didn't want this Tucker Act and these other things to apply. I just want to know what your reply is to that.     They are different.       Right.     So is -- are you also saying, FCRA, the underlying statute, clearly waives sovereign immunity, so we don't have to worry about whether the standard is a weak standard or a tough standard, doesn't matter.     We win anyway.       So what you want us to say is, okay.     We will apply the tough standard.     There's still -- there's still -- sovereign immunity is waived in FCRA.     And since sovereign immunity is clearly waived there, then you can bring this under the Tucker Act, and the only differences are the remedial schemes are slightly different, but that doesn't matter. Am I correctly stating what you are now telling us?
11-199 +++$+++        I suspect --       Well, I would like very much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical and the Chief Justice's.     As I understand those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --       -- where the particular piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's the kind of thing that could really make a difference. I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.       All right.     Now, in my reading of this, which I once had to read about 100 harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question, could this illegally admitted evidence make a difference?     Could it have made a difference in this case?     Could it have?     And the answer is going to be "no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not have thought it made a critical difference. And that's just putting the same thing I think slightly differently.     But the answer in Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going to think it has nothing to do with rationality.     If the jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close case.     And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless. And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't have made a difference to any rational person, he's going to say "harmless."     Period. Now, that was my impression reading those cases.     And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting at that.     And -- use them.     Answer them rather than me, because that's what I'm interested in. (Laughter.)
11-204 +++$+++        That's --       The --       Are they paid commissions? If they're -- if the salesman or the promotion agent, as the case may be, is successful in his territory in getting doctors to prescribe the drug, does he receive extra pay?       What does that mean?     Does he -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it says is a person who often obtains a commission on his sales.       And now what I'm trying to figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask the question -- are these people, people who in some sense or other receive commissions on their sales?       Let's pursue this for a second.       Because I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me speaking.     I don't know how anybody else feels.     If this had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance.     I would have said look at the statute; it says the Secretary defines it.     You'd say, well, can you define it in a brief?     Yes, you have to be careful of briefs, but, yes.     And that's the end of the case.     It's not a question for judges; it's a question for administrators. All right.     But now it's difficult for me because of the passage of 75 years.     And we can blame it in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary. There is blame to go around.     So, the question is, what do I do as a judge? And partly my instinct is get somebody to decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of Labor, because this is a hard question.     And that's where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he says all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what case do we cite? And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer. I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them with care.     And then I have the statute here, which talks about the Secretary doing the definition of "outside salesman," and I have lots of rules and regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in my opinion.     So, you tell me what to say.       Thank you.     I'll look at it.
11-210 +++$+++        An obvious example that used to be -- are there Jews hiding in the cellar?     No.       Are you hiding Jews in the cellar?       Why not?       My question is right that there are very good First Amendment reasons sometimes for protecting false information, and if this also would cause serious harm, what the government is aiming after, are there less restrictive ways of going about it?     And, if so, what and why?       Is there anything else - that the threat of criminal prosecution might discourage from lying who would never be caught.     So, at least as to that set, exposure won't work.     So, you have a less restrictive alternative that helps some but not completely.     Are there others?       Not under my theory.     My theory is that it does hurt the medal, the purpose, the objective, the honor, for people falsely to go around saying that they have this medal when they don't.     Okay? So, I might be wrong about that.     I just ask you to assume that for purposes of argument because what I'm trying to get to is I want as big a list as I can to think about of what the less restrictive alternatives are.       Or might be.       Well, how does it work in the law now, where we have similar statutes, and there's an additional requirement when you're imitating, say, a Federal officer or somebody else you shouldn't, you have to perform an overt act that asserts authority that the impersonator claims to have.     What does that add? Do you have to -- does it add enough to just make it not pure speech, to limit -- to wall off the things about -- the things that we're worried about in the First Amendment? Or there's another one, you have to falsely assume or exercise powers, duties, and privileges.     Those are ways statutes have of limiting this thing.     How does that work?       It has nothing to do with harm.     It's a way of walling off things that are of concern under the First Amendment from those that aren't.     And what they use -- I read you what they use: Performing -- you know -- you know the language.     It's written about in the briefs.     And I just want to know how you would think about a statute that imported that kind of language, which is limiting language.
11-246 +++$+++        No, no, no.     You can't -- I mean --       And I want to hear what you say.       But your injury, your injury is that it's being used for gambling.     So is there room for relief that could say the government can do what it wants to the land, it just can't let it be used for gambling, if you want. And that would cure your injury, and it wouldn't require the government to give back the land, and it wouldn't require any unscrambling, and title could rest in the government.     I don't know if that's possible or not possible.       I don't think Justice Scalia's argument was a bad argument.     I thought it was a rather good argument.     If in fact you go back and you take the view that any suit filed to review APA is not a quiet title action, people could go upset government title to property years and years later.     And they would say:     Oh, well, we're not challenging the title; we're just challenging what happened when it was taken, the title was taken. That can't be right, it seems to me, first blush.     So therefore, I thought you -- yours is different because you filed before they took title.     But as I say, I'm uncertain of that distinction. Now, your answer suggests you've been going both ways.     Sometimes you think, well, it matters that we filed before.     And other times, you think, no, it doesn't matter.
11-262 +++$+++        There's no --       Yes, but they did say -- and also you've left out that one of the agents overheard him say he was going to ask the Vice President how many babies he killed that day.       Okay.     So, their job is to protect the Vice President.       That's their job.       And it's a very emotional subject.       And if something happens to the President, nobody's going to say, oh, you know, what were you doing?     And the whole country is in mourning.       We understand that.     And, therefore, it's a matter of concern that the -- if you have a rule of law that says to the agents, when you hear someone who says how many babies are you going to kill that day, I'm going to ask the Vice President, I'm going to touch him, I am going to then tell them a lie when they ask me if I touched him -- that's cause for concern.       Okay.     Now, if there's a lawsuit, the agency will say we just can't do it.     We can't do it.     We can't use that as a basis for stopping that individual.       All that poses a problem. Now, you're -- and I -- I think -- I recognize it as a problem.     I'm not saying I have the solution.       Well, say, though, that in the case of the President, what you're hearing is, as you well know, that the combination of disparate political views and risk is unlike other situations. And I don't know if they can prove it or you could prove the contrary, but that's -- that's a claim.     And I can't say there's nothing to it. So, let me suggest to you another arrow which  Ill ask you what you think of this arrow, and the answer's going to be not much, but I'm interested in hearing --       -- your reason.       In -- in Hartman, Justice Ginsburg and I dissent.       And we referred to a D.C. Circuit case.     And in the D.C. Circuit, it said -- it talked about rare cases "where strong motive evidence combines with weak probable cause to support a finding that the prosecution would not have occurred but for the ... animus."     Now, so far, you think "fine." But suppose you were to say because of the factors that have just been mentioned where the President's at stake, the courts -- where his life is at stake, the President's -- the courts will not infer once probable cause exists that it's weak.     And the courts will not infer from the simple presence of political disagreement that the motive of retaliation is strong, which in fact would produce a very limited extension of Hartman to the case of protecting the President of the United States. And now, I know you're not going to agree with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you react.       Okay.     So, then putting it in their point of view, I just what he actually said. He was very angry, your client.     I mean, judging what he said -- there were a lot of swear words and so forth -- he was pretty angry at this whole situation. So, you're a Secret Service agent, and you hear him say -- speak like this -- he has every right to speak like that.     I mean people do.     I understand that. But now he's also thinking that -- I'm nervous about this.     The President is here, the Vice President, whatever --       -- same thing -- and I've got to do my job.     So -- and nobody's going to say, ho, ho, First -- whatever if is -- if somebody is hurt.       Now, he has also lied about whether he touched the President.       And he has also been talking about the President killing people.       Killing babies and so forth and --       All right.     So, what is he supposed to do in your view?       Well, it is in this situation --       But this situation, I've -- I'm pretty --       Nothing there.       He says, okay --       A lot of people in that place.       Well, he lied.     He --
11-338 +++$+++  
11-345 +++$+++        Can I ask you to get -- if this is easy, do it; if not, don't. I wanted to use accurate numbers, and so I discovered -- I wanted to find out how many universities actually used a Grutter-type process last year or the year before, etcetera.     And one of your amici, the admissions officers, according to our library, is the only place that has that information, though it's public, and I didn't want them to do it because they are an amici of yours.     And you are both here, both sides, so if you can agree on -- simply, roughly -- what that number is, I would like to know it; otherwise, I will -- I can use pre-Grutter numbers which are public and available.       All right, so.     But it is the correct answer to Justice Alito's -- if there are ever two applicants where the GPA, the test -- the grades, the SA1, SA2, leadership, activities, awards, work experience, community service, family's economic status, school's socioeconomic status, family's responsibility, single-parent home, languages other than English spoken at home, and SAT score relative to school's average race, if you had a situation where those -- all those things were absolutely identical, than the person would be admitted on the bounds of race.
11-393 +++$+++        But what he's thinking --       What he's thinking of is this:     I think Justice Scalia is thinking, I suspect, of -- imagine a tax which says this tax, amount Y, goes to purpose X, which will pay for half of purpose X.     The other half will come from the exchanges somehow.     That second half is unconstitutional.     Purpose X can't possibly be carried out now with only half the money. Does the government just sit there collecting half the money forever because nobody can ever challenge it?     You see, there -- if it were inextricably connected, is it enough to say, well, we won't consider that because maybe somebody else could bring that case and then there is no one else? I mean, is that --       -- I mean, on a list of things that are, in both your opinions, peripheral? Then you would focus on those areas where one of you thinks it's peripheral and one of you thinks it's not peripheral.     And at that point, it might turn out to be far fewer than we're currently imagining, at which point we could hold an argument or figure out some way or somebody would hold an argument and try to -- try to get those done. Is that a pipe dream or is that a --       But would you -- I'd just like to hear before you leave your argument, if you want to, against what Justice Scalia just said.     Let's assume, contrary to what you want, that the Government's position is accepted by the majority of this Court.     And so, we now are rid, quote, of the true "heart" of the bill.     Now, still there are a lot of other provisions here like the Indian Act, the black lung disease, the wellness program, that restaurants have to have a calorie count of major menus, et cetera. Now, some of them cost money, and some of them don't.     And there are loads of them.     Now, what is your argument that just because the heart of the bill is gone, that has nothing to do with the validity of these other provisions, both those that cost money or at least those that cost no money?     Do you want to make an argument in that respect, that destroying the heart of the bill does not blow up the entire bill; it blows up the heart of a bill?     And I'd just like to hear what you have to say about that.       Have you come across --       Yes.     Oh, I know.     So, you -- I would say stay out of politics.     That's for Congress, not us.       But the -- the question here is -- you've read all these cases or dozens -- have you ever found a severability case where the Court ever said:     Well, the heart of the thing is gone, and, therefore, we strike down these other provisions that have nothing to do with it, which could stand on their feet independently and can be funded separately or don't require money at all.
11-45 +++$+++        I don't want to delay you; so, don't pause too long.     But I've just been curious -- where did this rule -- is there a statute or something that says an agency can't say that this action would be unconstitutional?     Where does that idea come from?       So, that's his point.     So, I mean, that's -- but that's why I wondered.     I mean, U.S. magistrates, all -- tax courts, all kinds of people as a preliminary matter have jobs where they say we think a statute is unconstitutional.     I suppose millions.     I don't know how many.     So, is this coming that they can't do it from some kind of lore from Kenneth Davis or something or -- what's -- what's the basis of this?     And wouldn't it be simpler if you just said it says they can take appropriate relief?     They can take appropriate relief, period.     End of the matter.       Are there --       So, somebody quoted Kenneth Davis in 1958 and wrote it into an opinion in a holding?       So, Kenneth Davis said this in 1958?       Okay.
11-460 +++$+++        But, anyway, you say that the court held the same thing in two other cases involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of us.       And if they did hold what you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two cases.       Okay.     But if we decide that they needed file a cross-petition and they didn't, then what's the basis for our remanding, rather than reversing?       It's that issue that what we have to decide.       Sometimes, the Court says the bottom line in that italicized thing, which I've never fully understood when and when we don't do it, but it just says, "Reversed."       But the question -- the question is when do we do the one or the other, and I think, here, what they're saying is, just write the word "Reversed," we'll deal with the rest of it.     All right. So that's --       But as I read it, and he explained it, I thought that, look, what they're thinking is this:     Stormwater is really a big problem, and it's really complicated how you work it out, and we want the agencies to work it out.     So the purpose of this monitoring thing is we first determine that there is an exceedance. Now, once we determine that there is an exceedance, which is the point of this pertinent particular requirement, then we're going to go on to decide who.     And what we're going to do is leave you with two possible choices.     One is you can try to figure out who, which means you've got to get an expert and monitor it; or let us now have a new permit which will -- will -- you know, which will -- which will put some responsibility on the individuals, because we'll monitor higher up the river. Now, that's a rational way for an agency to proceed and it leaves you with pretty good remedies. And so why -- why are we running all around, trying to work this thing out?     Why don't you just sort of try to deal with it as they described it and say, okay, we're going to either prove you did it before or at least we can prove it now?       Okay.     So the upshot would be, however, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, that since they're doing that now anyway under the new permit -- and you can question my hypothetical assumption there -- but if they are doing it under the new permit, then the only result of your winning this would be to transfer the running of the district from the agency to the court.     And I suspect the Ninth Circuit knows less about it than you participating in a -- some kind of negotiation with the agency.       Your basic argument is this permit requires you, L.A. County, to do monitoring, to decide if you're violating it.     You chose this system, then common sense suggests you're doing it.     You struck out twice with that argument --       -- in the other two rivers, and now, you're going to go back if we permit it, and we want to make the argument and tell the Ninth Circuit, three times and you're out; in this case, hold the opposite.       Thats what you want us - I understand it. (Laughter.)       Couldn't you get some expert who understands --       I see.     What do you think of the government's point?     They are telling us, just write what you usually write, and then you can go make all your arguments, see what they do.     Does that satisfy you?
11-465 +++$+++        -- Can we go back a minute, please, to Justice Kennedy's question about page 104(a). I read the court of appeals' opinion.     Most of it, about six or eight pages, recites the facts. Then they discuss the law.     The legal discussion is on page 104(a).     It's approximately 30 lines long.     More than half of it concerns Federal law. I mean, they don't just cite that Federal case.     They say, "In assessing whether a juror is impartial for Federal constitutional purposes -- Federal constitutional purposes -- the United States Supreme Court has said," da, da, da, then they quote it all. Now, since your argument, the argument in the -- in this brief here is entirely Sixth Amendment, as far as I can tell, they say, look, look what happened here, they took this man off the jury.     That violates my rights to Sixth Amendment right.     It says it over and over and over.     I have no doubt you raised it. And now they give an answer.     And the answer that they give consists of 30 lines, and 16 of the lines consist of Federal law. So -- so what's the problem?       The remaining 14 lines do consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say they didn't consider the Federal issue?       No, they didn't quote -- Nesler doesn't.     What they did in Nesler is quote a Federal case.     And what they do here is not just say Nesler, they quote the Federal case.       Well, maybe it doesn't. Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly state what Federal law is.     Everybody has some concerns about that one. But what I don't see is how when they spend 14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they believe sets the standard for impartiality and partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the Federal issue.       For Constitutional purposes.     And this guy was kicked off the jury because they thought he was not impartial.       Well, then your claim over in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no reasonable juror could reach -- no reasonable jurist could reach the conclusion that they reached on the issue. That argument is open to you.     The only thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or wrongly.       Which happens to be the issue in this case.       No.     Now, what the court says about that argument, what the court of appeals says, is that the argument of your client not only misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but they're criticizing -- and then he says, "It ignores the trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased." So this court of appeals thinks the issue is whether he had shown sufficient bias.     You think the answer to that is clearly no.     The Government thinks it's yes.     And I can understand the differences of opinion, but I'm back to my question. It seems to me in 14 lines they do address the Federal constitutional question of bias.     And that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue, et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it correctly. But you see what's bothering me.     And so I've listened to the answer.     Do you want to add anything?       That was one of the things. Then they go through in those four pages about six other -- they called -- he gave one story to the judge, Juror No. 6. Then the prosecution calls about eight other jurors, and they come up with quite a different story about what he was telling them in the jury room and -- that I'm not going to convict him.     Well, he didn't quite say that; he was talking about Vietnam and talking about the slaves, and you don't want to convict a person for -- make him return the slave. I mean, they talked about a lot of things. And he went through all that, and then concludes he was biased.     And your point was he wasn't biased.     He was going to decide it fairly. Okay, I'm listening.

I might have missed the part that you're about to cite to, because I'd like you to tell me where in the Redbook it says that a contractor who has a contract that says "subject to appropriations" and is then dealing with the law of Congress which says the appropriation will not exceed X million is then entitled to be paid on a contract where he and like contracts do exceed X million.     Where does it say that in the Redbook?       I couldn't find it.       I did read it.     I just would like to know what page you want me to read again. I read the Chamber of Commerce brief.     The Chamber of Commerce brief says everybody knows that the contractors are paid in this situation.     So I looked up the authorities that they cited.     Okay? I read the Redbook.     I read my other case of Cherokee.     I read Ferris.     I read Sutton.     I can't say I'm perfect at reading --       -- but I couldn't find it.       So I would appreciate your referring me to those citations.       Okay.       Here it is.       No, no.     I have the Redbook 6-44.       I'm not saying it isn't there.     I just read through these pretty quickly.     I just need a little refresher.       Oh, I don't have that one.       No.     That isn't quite my question.     My question was:     I would like the authority for the proposition that when you have a set of contractors, and they read their contract, and it says "subject to appropriation," and then you read the law, and it says they will not be paid, it shall not exceed $4 million, and then you discover that the amount of the contracts of the same kind in this category are more than $4 million, I want to know where in the Redbook it says that they get paid more than $4 million. That's all.     That's fairly simple. And if that's -- if that's normal practice, it must be there's a lot of authority for it.     So I -- I just want to know what to read.       But they aren't talking about there where it says specifically in the contract "subject to appropriations."     At least I think they're not. Now, I would like you right now to tell me, no, you're wrong; it does say that.       They're distinguishing Sutton from Ferris.       They're trying to use that to distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with, well, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a line appropriation.     And I thought that just refers to the fact that because there's a line appropriation, the contractor's on notice.       Exactly. And when you do business with the government over a period of years, and it says "subject to appropriation," not necessarily you but your lawyer, who's a good lawyer, should look up and see what the appropriation is or whether it was made.     And that's what I gather --       No, no, not as a matter of policy.     I'm putting it as a question because that was my first reaction.     And I expect you to say, no, Justice Breyer --       -- you're wrong, and that isn't the practice, and here is what I read to show that isn't the practice.     That's all I'm asking.       By showing me where in the law it says -- and I don't want to repeat the question for the third time, but it says --       Well, here sometimes not everyone pays sufficient attention to these very clear questions. (Laughter.)       Where -- look, hypothetical.     Four people, four identical contracts, the words appear, "subject to appropriation."       Each is for a million dollars. Then you read the appropriation that was later made, and in that statute, it says, we hereby appropriate $3 million, and -- it is, the payments are not to exceed $3 million. Okay?    Something like that.      All I want is the authority that says each of those four people can come in and get the $1 million, totaling $4 million.    I want the authority that says that.       No.     Ferris -- it did not say anything about it in the contract.      Oh, there certainly is. Putting in the words gives the lawyer notice.       It does?     Where do you get -- I couldn't find the contract.     The language in Ferris is, "a contractor who is one of several persons to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable with knowledge of its administration."     True. Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to get to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge. And the second thing in Ferris is that it was an individual who went off on his own in the administration and paid money that he shouldn't have paid.     It should have been over here for the contract. In this case, it is an instance where Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was paid, and didn't provide enough.     Okay. So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a big question mark.     And I guess you could talk about that, but all I wanted to know is what is well established in this field.       I don't want to write something that suddenly upsets what is well established.       And that is that as it says in the contract, you are barred, you are barred from recovering if we don't appropriate enough money. Should it say that wouldn't matter?     Is that right?
11-556 +++$+++ 
11-564 +++$+++        You're assuming the conclusion in these things.     I mean, I thought since Katz the rule has been whether the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of privacy in -- which is infringed or violated or interfered with when the government acts.     So it's a question of does he have that reasonable expectation.     So now we're back to exactly where we were.     Your opponents say, no, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy --       -- to protect a person with a dog coming up to the door and going (indicating), all right?     Now, your response to that is what?       And then the question was, as Justice Alito put it, why?     He says, we go back to the 17th century, as far as you want, and there is no law that says there is any kind of expectation in a homeowner that a person won't walk up to the dog -- to the door with a dog on a leash and sniff, which, as he says -- which your opponents say is what happened here. And your response to that is?       I'll look at this later, but I'm rather surprised.     My understanding of the case law was the Chief Justice's, and I thought what you're supposed to look at is the behavior of the individual, the police officer, who comes to the door or looks into the house, not his subjective motive. Now, as we just heard, you said, and with support here, that Jones changed that, but I don't know what in Jones changed that.     Jones was the case where the police did in fact go to a person's car and physically put something in it.     That's -- something that tracked.     That's behavior.       So what is it in Jones that said what we're supposed to look at is not behavior, but the subjective intent of the officer?       I mean, it may be a search. I see that.       Not a police officer.     If we start -- policemen have to know how to behave.     And in this area, they can behave the same way as other people can behave, and we expect them to behave, even though their motive differs.     They're always trying to find crime.     That's what I thought the law was. I've been trying to figure out just what you say, but in a slightly different form.     Do people come up to the door with dogs?     Yes.     Do the dogs breathe? Yes. Do in fact policemen, like other people, come up and breathe?     Yes.     Do we expect it?     Yes, we expect people to come up and breathe.     But do we expect them to do what happened here?     And at that point, I get into the question:     What happened here?     And I'd be interested in your view on that.
11-5683 +++$+++        Suppose you're wrong about that.       Suppose you're wrong about that.     I mean, I think when they -- they meant do it, that considered.     Does that change?       No.     I mean, I think that when they wrote 3553, they were thinking those were the guidelines that are going to apply.     Do it.     Now, I'll look into that. But if I -- if I reach the conclusion I agree competing background rules -       I agree applicable law doesn't help us, because -- all the time, there are two different sets of guidelines that apply depending upon when you committed the crime.     That's very common.     All right.     So, I agree with you that far. But now I'm worried about -- the last question Justice Scalia asked does, I think, focus this question, because we have not only 109; we have also the -- the one we're talking about now, and that says, normally, you will apply the guidelines in effect even to people who committed the crime before the new statute.       And now, do we have any analogies?     Has this ever happened before?     Is there -- I can't find out how many people we're talking about. I'd like to know at least are there many other occasions when Congress amended mandatory minimums so there's some precedent?     Any?       Yes.       Yes.       Wait, wait.     This is - just tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe I'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked. Think of before the statute.     There were two sets of people:     Those people subject to the mandatory minimum and those crack people who -- the mandatory minimum didn't matter, but the Commission wrote amendments consistent with. So, they were tough amendments, though the law didn't require it -       -- to produce consistency. Now the statute's passed.     Now we have some of the pre-Act offenders.     Because of the two sets of things, section 8 on the one hand and the 3553(g) on the other, in respect to those people who were not governed by the mandatory minimum previously but were subject to the then-conforming amendments, now will have to be subject to new conforming amendments that conform to the new thing. And that -- because that'll have to be because of the combination of the two sections that Mr. Dreeben read, the -- all right.     Now, if that's so, we get to the cliffs that Justice Kagan is talking about. And if I'm right so far, we're now back at the probation officer example, and it's so odd and so peculiar that it is not just a fair -- do you see where I'm going?       I don't blame you, frankly. But I -       All right.       I don't blame you.     I don't blame you.
11-597 +++$+++        What is the legal rubric? I mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until you've been putting it this way is that the Government builds a dam.     When it does it, water backs up behind the dam, and that water might flood somebody's land. That's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so forth. Okay.     Now, the Government builds a dam, all that happens.     Because the Government builds a dam, a lot of other things happen.     They release water sometimes.     They make electricity sometimes.     Different animals come in. All kinds of things can happen to different people 200 yards down.     Some will be 200 miles down, 200 -- you know.     Some will be helpful, some will be hurtful.     Can they never bring a lawsuit?     Can they sometimes recover?     How do we look at that?       Well, then, suppose what the Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land, and you can't even walk on it without a boat.     All right, that would be at least a regulatory taking.       So why -- now, they're doing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a regulation, they send some water in to do it.     So should we analyze it as a regulatory taking?       Well, but that's the issue.       But building a Government project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension wires, you could require the taking of some land to build it.     Now, you've got that and you begin to run it. You could run it in such a way that it takes some of the property.     I mean, the electricity could, for example, because of some odd thing run around over somebody's land and kill all the chickens.     That wasn't expected but it happened, and it happened because of the way the Government runs the plant. Now, I guess there would be a taking in such circumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it makes that land which no one thought would happen, as a consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there be?       The collateral consequence is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite unexpectedly, but totally uninhabitable.     Now, what's supposed to happen there?     That's not just a trespass because it's permanent.     And even if it's once every 2 years, it's permanently once every 2 years.       What does it say?       Yes, but they made this --       Yes.       All right.     So -- well, that's the part -- that's the point.     The reason they don't compensate there is it apparently had something to do with everybody suffering the cinders.     But where the cinders went out of the train and they ended up on just one person's property because there were some pipes or something, then it was a taking.       Well, here they're focusing it on his land.
11-626 +++$+++        This cup.     What about the cup?       Oh, well, this is lighter than you think.       -- because it - it has some other implication that I don't understand.     Okay. So call it the function or the capacity, and it really does as a significant matter of carrying things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its walls, but -- but things from place to place to some significant degree, okay?     So I've just taken the words of the test and through voice -- and trying to focus your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a -- it has to be some significant degree there, which this one doesn't seem to have, all right? So you see what I'm trying to do, and really it's a way of getting you to respond to that.       But it wasn't carrying things.       Well, that's true.     And of course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or something that is on top.     But when you have a thing that carries itself, that isn't good enough.       It has to be something to do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.       That's what part of the house.       All right.     Think of what it's doing and compare that with the dredge that every day the workmen get on, they go into the middle of Boston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they dredge. And so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of this boat is to carry those people out there. Now think of this one.     This one is carrying things, but that which it carries is just what is part of a normal house which has nothing to do with transporting things on water.       Okay.     How do you then distinguish -- I see where you're -- you're just saying my distinction is not going to work, and so then I'd ask you to say what one you want to come up with that will get rid of all the absurd examples that are lurking in the back of my mind, which I will avoid -- and yet include -- (Laughter.)       The floating sofa?     The floating sofa?     Somebody is retired, he likes to see it float around in the water, and you know, and it carries a cushion.     I mean, really that's absurd.     So -- so how do you distinguish -- I gave you an absurd example.     I don't need to think of more.       Well --       That's where - that's exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with you at the moment hypothetically.     So something's wrong somewhere.     And what I'm thinking is that you could have very odd things, you know, like an advertising sign, floating advertising sign and tow it around.     Is that floating advertising sign a vessel?     No, it doesn't carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the figure which might move around; and then it does -- and Justice Kennedy said carrying goods.     All right.     Does this structure, this houseboat have a function of carrying goods?     You're tempted to say yes, because his personal effects are in it.     I'm attempted to say no, because there is nothing special about those personal effects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a similar structure on land. That's where I am wondering if there is a distinction.     That's -- do you see what I -- what's bothering me?       No, it's nothing --       Is there any problem here, which I think maybe the Coast Guard and the other people who are responsible for vessels, say once we start thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I overstate -- we're going to have an impossible time doing our job.     I mean, you know, you are going to see some kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and somebody's going to start calling it a vessel.     We've got to limit this somehow to things that really are used as vessels.       Is that a problem, and if so, how would you deal with it?
11-681 +++$+++    The question you're being asked, I think, is a broader question. Collective bargaining with any employer, meat packers, hours, safety depends on hours, always can involve public interest questions.   But I think the question you're being asked is where you have SEIU or AFSCME, and they're government unions, does it have a bigger mix of public policy issues; and therefore, should this Court get into the business -- I'm putting it in a little loaded way because I don't want to suggest the answer. Should this Court make that distinction and get into the business of saying, when the union is too much of a -- wages, hours, and working conditions are too likely to affect public issues, and the other ones less likely, et cetera, you see the distinction that the question that was added suggests? Now, I would like you to think about -- that's a philosophical question -- or a very broad First Amendment question. And I'd like to hear what your answer is and the government's.
11-697 +++$+++        You don't need that.       Your -- 602(a) has plenty of meaning.     I mean, an American copyright holder licenses a British company to publish the work under British copyright law.     602(a) says he can't import the books into the United States, period.       Now, the only -- so there's plenty of meaning there.     The question is what happens when he sells it to his bookstore and you or I go in and buy it and we want to give a copy to our wife when we get back to the United States.     The question is, did -- is that unlawful?       No, no exception I take it once I bring back five copies and I give one to my son.       Oh, fair use.       The reason -- what I was trying to bring up and I didn't do it artfully --       -- is, imagine Toyota, all right?     Millions sold in the United States.     They have copyrighted sound systems.     They have copyrighted GPS systems.     When people buy them in America, they think they're going to be able to resell them. Now, under your reading -- now, this is one of their horribles, I gather, and I want to know your answer to it.     Under their reading, the millions of Americans who buy Toyotas could not resell them without getting the permission of the copyright holder of every item in that car which is copyrighted.       Is that right?       Am I right or am I wrong? Am I off base or am I wrong -- am I right?       Well, how do you distinguish?     How do you distinguish?       Now, explain to me, because there are horribles if I summarize them, millions and millions of dollars' worth of items with copyrighted indications of some kind in them that we import every year; libraries with three hundred million books bought from foreign publishers that they might sell, resell, or use; museums that buy Picassos that now, under our last case, receive American protection as soon as that Picasso comes to the United States, and they can't display it without getting permission from the five heirs who are disputing ownership of the Picasso copyrights. Those are some of the horribles that they sketch.     And if I am looking for the bear in the mouse hole, I look at those horribles, and there I see that bear. So I'm asking you to spend some time telling me why I'm wrong.       But we need to --       But what about litigation in this respect?     I want to bring you back to the horribles.       The main point is that horribles haven't occurred.     Right?       Sometimes horribles don't occur because no one can believe it. Now, for example, I believe there is going to be a storm, but it hasn't started yet. So I would like to know -- I would like to know, if you were the lawyer for the Toyota distributor, and if you were the lawyer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or you are the lawyer for a university library, and your client comes to you and says, my God, I just read the Supreme Court opinion.     It says that we can't start selling these old books or -- or lending them or putting them in our word processor or reselling the Toyota without the -- without looking -- displaying the Picasso without the permission of the copyright holder, who may or may not be Toyota itself. What, as their lawyer, do you tell them?     Do you tell them, hey, no problem; or, do you tell them, you might become a law violator; or, do you tell them, I better litigate this?     What do you tell them?       Well, the word has grounding.     It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition is no good.     And Coke says, and that's how it should be. And now that's picked up in Bobbs-Merrill; it's picked up in Dr. Miles.     It's been the law. Now if, in fact, there are two ways of interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with that basic principle of commercial law, and the other produces some of the complexities that you have just mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and simply reaffirm a principle that's been in the commercial law almost forever?
11-702 +++$+++        But it's the word "punishable," I think.
11-713 +++$+++        Do you have -- what is that based on?       Yes, I read -- I read -- I read the opinion and what she said on the phone and so forth.       It seems to me that it's a complicated case.     Let's suppose you're completely right on your time schedule.     Then they'll decide something. How could any human being redraw maps in 5 days or 10 days where you'll have different -- six different positions?     I mean, I think it's impossible.     How can you -- I don't see how you could do it.       Well, I think there's -- it seemed to me from reading it, I -- I didn't think that the judge there is ready to grant preclearance.       But the other thing in sending it back, I read the brief, and then I read the opinions.     I don't think I have -- I'm not being too generous to the opinions, but I thought what they were saying throughout is we didn't try to draw extra coalition or extra opportunity districts; they emerged. They say "emerged" about seven times.     They emerged as we tried to apply equal vote principles.     And it's hardly surprising that it would, considering that the population growth is primarily due to the minority expansion. So, they didn't seem to me -- now, why do you want us to send it back to get more explanation when that seems to be the explanation, and to me at first blush, it seems like a perfectly good explanation.       What he says two sentences before, if I can be helpful to read it, the fourth new district, district 33, was drawn in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex "to reflect population growth in that area."     All right?       Then he goes on to say just what Justice Scalia says. And I -- I did read that as saying, well, when you apply -- I read it consistent what they've said in -- elsewhere, which is that what they're doing is population grows; you have to have one person, one vote; the legislature itself in the new plan did create a minority, whatever you -- the opportunity district here; so, we're following what they did; we're taking into account population, and it turns out to be, and we do create it as -- in which case there is some ambiguity here.
11-770 +++$+++        But is it in the process? Does Summers apply and does this apply only when the police are in the process of executing a valid search warrant?       If -- if the police executing the valid search warrant walked through the gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the house had not yet passed through the gate, then under Summers the police would have the right to detain him. All right.     So the question here is he's walked through the gate.     All right.     Now, I guess the police -- all right, I see.     The police objection is:     I don't know.     These things are complicated and we might not want to push him back.     I don't know what the neighborhood is like and maybe somebody will get killed. I mean, that's the kind of argument --       I know you'd say that was right.       Maybe he had a key to the -- to the place where they keep the drugs, the basement or something.       Is that fanciful?     Is it fanciful that people who are searched open doors or --
11-796 +++$+++        Well, is -- I mean, that is an interesting question because you can imagine -- you see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with hosts of things which are self-replicating.       And some of the self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end up inadvertently all over the place.     Is there anything in the patent law that deals with that?     Is an involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law as a voluntary infringer?       Is -- is there precautions that you take?     I mean, is there anything in patent law that helps?       Right.       Well, the person plants it.       I mean, he plants it, but he doesn't even know, you know.     He's just got -- we can imagine a lot of circumstances where this would be a -- where Justice Kagan's question could apply.       But you're just saying that would need a --       -- modification in patent law.       What about -- what about the other question --       No, no, no, I want to go back to a different question that was asked, which was the question what do you think we should do about this other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect?     I mean, I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is just permissive. It is to create generation 2.     But -- but they also said something in the circuit about a license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on -- on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for creating generation 3, namely you can't do that. Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that there's some restriction in a license and they have a doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after it's been sold.     And that would seem contrary to the First Sale Doctrine.       But you don't need that because in each instance, as you say, you are making new ones.     It's the making of the new ones, not the use of the old ones, where you prevent that from being done.       Then you use the word "use."       Then you use the word "use" and you get to the same place.       I don't think you can think of an example.     I mean, you say -- I don't think you can think of an example where if you win on the other ground, you can produce a bad result for the manufacturer or the inventor because you haven't treated the conditional sale like a license.     I'm not saying you can't, I just can't think of one.       So lease it.       So lease it.
11-798 +++$+++        Well, that's why the route regulation thing is the exception.     But the State of California decides --       Pardon me.     I know you're Page 35 not.     The State of California decides, here's what we have, a State public utilities commission which issues a tariff, and what the tariff says is anyone who contracts with a person in this State, a property owner, to move his goods and services, cannot charge less than $30 a pound.     All right?     Plainly preempted. And your case differs because?       You're saying it falls outside the definition of "routes."     Well, that argument is not in front of us.     I mean, I thought we were conceding here it falls within the definition of routes or rates or services.       The parking regulation --       Well, if it doesn't fall within, then I'm not sure what we're talking about because I thought the problem was that it does fall within the rates, routes and services, and then the question is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera.       That's why I asked you, and how does it differ from the hypothetical I just put?       There are three reasons, and the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't survive in a policy of deregulation it would seem to apply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue that with you. I want to be sure I have the second and third.       But what is the second and third?       And what's the one that would be?     Give me the example that you're thinking of where, given Castle --       -- and its applications, it would be -- Page 46       All right.     Now, how does -- how -- how would that differ from Castle? Because what Castle was concerned about was a State that has a perfectly lawful regulation, and it's violated, then the State as the remedy excludes the truck from the State.       That's what it's concerned about.     And it didn't say anything about accepting very serious violations, i.e., continuing ones.     The reason was the need for interstate regulation of an interstate enterprise.     And that was the reasoning.     Leave it to the ICC, a fortiori, where it's deregulatory policy, but leave that to the side. I want to know your best case in that one, and I don't see the example yet.       Make -- make this argument precisely and substitute for "port authority" the words "city of San Diego," okay?     And -- and you'd be still right.     I mean, what's bothering me is, I -- I don't know you've got the right one.     So -- so if we decide in your way, what we've done is distinguish precisely the Page 52 same situation, you from the city of Los Angeles, simply because of the method they have of governmentally regulating the port.       Why?       All right.     I see.
11-817 +++$+++        I didn't think they disagreed about what he may do; I thought they disagreed about what he must do.     That is, the Florida Supreme Court said you must, da, da, da, da, da, and gave a whole list.     I thought that's what the case was about.       That's a totally different matter.     Of course, I agree with you that a trial judge has control of the trial.     He's likely to know what's relevant.     In different circumstances, different matters will be, and he has first say on what you're going to go into.     It's the must. And now you're on the point.     Why is that the right list?     I mean, what in the Constitution requires that list?       Didn't the Supreme Court believe the Constitution required it?
11-820 +++$+++        All right, so given the ABA and everything else, why doesn't that apply here?       No, but I mean if the general rule is that Strickland evolves to pick up changing professional norms, and that -- you looked at 30 cases and that's what you get out of them -- and then it turns out that at the time this case began, there was such a professional norm; and all that happened in Padilla is that the Court following its general practice said apply that professional norm; then why doesn't the other side win?       That, of course, is true, but the professional norm had evolved by the time of the proceeding here that they would.       No, but -- in the other -- in the other, by the way, in the other 29 cases, did the court specifically say in each of those 29 cases that the basis of our decision is that the professional norm has evolved and we apply the new professional norm as of the time?       Can you go back for a second to Justice Ginsburg's question?     I'd like -- I just don't want you to leave without -- without answering the following:     Normally a new rule that this Court announces would apply to cases on direct review.       Right.     In the case of inadequate assistance of counsel, without being picky, the place where that claim is best developed, in my view is first collateral, because for reasons we both understand.     All right.     So given the fact that by and large it is, and I think should be, developed in that way, why not treat in the case of an inadequate assistance claim the first collateral as in other claims you treat direct review?       You could say that, you could say that same thing precisely about the cases on direct review which have not been completed.     I mean, you could give all those arguments exactly the same.     If you're worried about the time, you could have time limits on the first Federal -- the first Federal habeas or state habeas. There are time limits there.     You could add to those.     And the -- the -- the direct review is itself a balance.     It's a balance between the surprise and need to complicate the case, and it hasn't really finished and da, da, da, versus the problem of giving a person a chance to raise this argument even for a new rule.       And so all those -- those are the -- when you look at the functional factors, it looks quite similar to me and I'm trying to --
11-864 +++$+++        The strongest argument I think for that point of view would be simply this:     The Smith Company makes widgets.     The plaintiff says they monopolize the widget business.     That business has monopolized because they achieved the power to raise price above the competitive level through exclusionary practices.     For example, United Fruit used to pour garbage on the ships of its competitors. Now, we have here a class of people who have been injured by their monopoly power -- and here they are, and you give a list.     The judge says to the other side, how do you know that's the right list?     Well, we know; here's how we know.     We have an expert here who has used a model to pick out the right people who were injured by the monopoly power -- its exercise.     And the other side says, no, that model is no good. Well, if it genuinely is no good and really worthless, then I guess you haven't shown these are the right people for the class.     And I think that's what they're saying.     And so the response to that is, to answer this question, do we have to go look at the model?     I mean, on its face, it seems okay.     I don't know.     I haven't looked at the record.     And --       Could you talk about that a little bit, please?       Did I get my analysis right?       I want to know -- if you think of the examples I just -- do you, as the plaintiff, when you draw up your list of class members, have to have on that list people who really were hurt by the -- or plausibly were hurt by the exercise of market power?     And you have to have some way of picking them out, and you have chosen this model as a way.     So I guess they could object on the ground that model is worthless. Is this analysis right?     And you would have to show, no, it isn't worthless.       You don't have to show that much.     I think you only have to show it's a plausible model.       And I guess, in a monopolization case, it is not the case that you have to trace the damages to the exclusionary conduct.       In a classical class of -- Section 2 case, the damages are caused by the monopolization, which lacks skill, foresight, and industry justification.     So the fact that he omitted three, but kept one has nothing to do with damages in a classical Section 2 case, is that right?       But here is the difficulty that I am having, a little technical, but -- but it -- this is a regulated industry.       And because it's a regulated industry, the regulator, in your view, is doing one of the worst jobs in history.     They are willing to come in and overbuild and everything, so he must be letting prices -- all right.     Suppose the judge or lawyer were to find, that's okay, it doesn't matter, all we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says. Then, if that were true, from looking at the footnote on this, I guess you'd take this model, and you would simply subtract or add to the base, which is supposed to be the competitively priced districts.       The districts that also have satellite.       And that shouldn't be tough to do, but I don't know if it's tough to do, and I don't see how we're ever going to find out.       I don't know.     How would you answer such a question?
11-88 +++$+++        I took -- I took -- the reason I say that is because if you want to elaborate on this -- because I purposely asked it, but I -- one of the things in the Government's brief that did, as I said, have an impact was Father Drinan is asked, shouldn't we have here -- this is before it reads "individual"; it reads "person" at this time -- shouldn't we have another definition for including organizations like the PLO?     He responds, "I think that we should exclude non-governmental organizations."       "I think it would be best to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related groups." Now -- but you heard the response to that, which really was, if I look at the context, I'll see that's less relevant than I think -- than I did think. So, what do you think?       That's why they're thinking of it.     His argument the other way, which I see now, is that -- is that, look, Father Drinan and the others are not talking about individual versus person; they're talking about whether, say, the PLO falls under color of law of a foreign state.     And so, they're not thinking of that question.       And if -- and if, in fact, it does fall under color of law there, they don't care about whether it's individual or person.     They've never really thought about that.       In fact, the only one who thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was four bills earlier.     And --
11-889 +++$+++        But there was a point, it seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 - the '70s, when they drafted this.       So they are in the room, and there are representatives of all four States, and as they argue, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet, what happens?     And Louisiana would say, we want at least percent, done.     Arkansas, 25 percent, done. Oklahoma, same, done.     Texas, same, done. But everybody in the room knows that Texas could never get more than 12 percent within its borders. And since it could never get 12 -- more than 12 percent, Louisiana would be sitting there with not really percent but with 38.     And so -- so -- - - - - -       -- that would suggest that, hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must be some way for Texas to get the extra.     Otherwise, why were they saying 25 percent for Texas?     If -       You know, this is an example I made up because I think -       -- an imaginary conversation.       But if in an imaginary conversation -       Why?       Wouldn't that be a fairly easy thing to check going back to 1970 -       -- to found out whether, you know, Texas was just on some little salt flat -       -- near the river and -       In Subbasin 1, that's mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or the other way around?     It looked to me like Subbasin 1's in Oklahoma.       Subbasin 1.     It says Subbasin 1.       Yes, 401.       Okay.     I get it.     I get it. Anyway -       -- because of that and because during the time when, let's say, there's ,000 feet of the -- of the 2,000 extra, you know, Louisiana has to get 500.     Okay.     How do they know whether they're getting it?     I mean, how -- there must be some system of measurement going on or how does this all work?       So, so -- - in other words -       Fine.     So that -- I don't know how that cuts because certainly the people who drew this must have thought at least in those other provisions they are going to develop a measurement system in case of controversy.       The relevant legal argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us about this Reach in the subbasin.     60 percent goes to Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma.       Okay.     Now, they've never measured it.     That's because they never fought about it, I guess.     And now we have a fight.     So why is it any easier to develop the necessary measuring system there -       -- than it would be here?       And that argues against you because your main point, really, is that this is all too complicated -
11-8976 +++$+++        This is true, but his point -- basic point -- and he has responded to the points I've made, is that, of course, if there's a five-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the government that he create -- he committed a robbery before.       All right.     So he's saying what you charged in the indictment is that he was a member of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and 2005.     Now, that's the crime that concerns us, roughly. And he is saying, to prove your case, you have to show, as an element, that he was a member. Now, you did present some evidence that he was a member.     And he wants to present some evidence, and has, that he wasn't a member.     And he wasn't a member if he withdrew.     And therefore, once he presents enough to get -- make that an issue, you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member.     So you have to show he didn't withdraw. Now, this has nothing to do with the statute of limitations.     By coincidence, it does.     But a statute of limitations issue would be that you all agree that he withdrew, but the question is did it happen in 1993 or 1997?     That's a statute of limitations issue, but this isn't. This is a question of whether he was a member of the conspiracy during the time period that you charged in the indictment.     That's his point.     So what is the response?       Well, in other words, you can charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here with what?     Not charging them?     You are saying there was a conspiracy?     Doesn't he have to be shown to be a member of the conspiracy in order for you to get a conviction?       And that's an element of the crime?       There is no more relevance, is there, to the fact that there happened to be a pre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof -- I shouldn't say relevance -- that he happened to rob a bank before 1995?     I mean, in each instance, there was criminal activity before 1995. Now, you can use that in order to prove that he was a member during '95 to 2000.     That, I see.     But he, similar, can use the matter of withdrawal to prove he wasn't a member during 1995 to 2000.     And, therefore, it goes to show whether you or the government have proved an element of the offense, namely, that he was a member between '95 and 2000.       I mean, I am looking at it as a puzzle here because I think you could look at it either way.     I mean, if a person commits a burglary and the indictment charges that, and he says, yes, I did, I did, there is no doubt about all the elements being satisfied, but it happened outside the limitation period.     That's in the statute of limitations area. But where you charge a conspiracy taking place within a period of time, as I would think you usually would -- I would think the -- those words on the paper almost always have a date in them -- then you could look at it as a question of membership in that conspiracy, the one that's charged, in which case, it's a question of the elements. And then, if you're in doubt as to whether or not the time that he withdrew was inside or outside the period, that becomes a limitations question.       And then I'm -- I'm sort of -- I'm torn here.     I actually can see it either way.       No, that isn't true.     You have to prove membership.       And it happens, in this instance, that you bring in a prima facie case.     I'd be repeating myself.     And that he says withdrawal, and withdrawal is designed to negate membership.       But then the withdrawal prior to the time charged negates membership in the conspiracy that you have charged because there was no membership during that time.       Well, I suspect I agree. If -- it's awfully tough to turn this on the presence or absence of particular dates in the indictment, but the -- the thing that motivates me -- I mean, I can see it's like a rabbit-duck.     You know, is it a rabbit, or is it a duck?     And -- and the -- the -- the thing that is so rare in the law --       Yet it's so rare, that the government doesn't have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that it suggests, when in doubt, say reasonable doubt. But -- so what do you want?     I mean, we've thought of duress.     We've thought of self-defense.       Insanity.       Anything else?       Nothing to do with statute of limitations.
11-9307 +++$+++        Well, what about the -- I mean, that's the question.     The word "plain" of course refers by and large to an error that the lower court judge should have caught, so you should have objected. But why limit it exclusively to that; that is, you have -- you know, they quote the Schooner, Peggy and Chief Justice Marshall and back to the history of Hammurabi, as far as we know, that sometimes there is a case where just simple fairness, plus the fact that the law is now plain, means that the appellate court should treat this person the same as a thousand others who now will be treated according to the new law. And indeed, you're complicating it even further for the reason that I really meant my question to be aimed at you -- you know.     I mean, in fact, the reason that I said that you're going to create distinctions, there will be a case, the fellow is going to go to jail for 50 extra years, the law is plain that he shouldn't, that didn't come about until the appeal. And here we have six identical people in the circuit where the law was clear one way and they get the new rule's advantage, and six identical people in another circuit where the law was clear the other way and they get the advantage.     But in the one circuit where the law wasn't clear, he doesn't get the advantage of the new rule. Now, that seems pretty unfair, and I could at least make up some cases where it's just a horror. And if that's so, why don't we leave plain with enough wiggle room so that where it's fair, the judge on the Court of Appeals can say, it is now plain and the other things are satisfied so we apply it to the defendant. That's the whole long question that I've got every part of it in there.       Whoa, whoa.       Here, that's -- it's the second part. I mean, I think you'd have a stronger argument were it not for Johnson.     But Johnson is saying, look, if you're in a circuit where the law turns out to be absolutely clearly wrong, then you don't have to make an objection.     And then what we do is we consider whether the matter was clear at the time of appeal. Now, once I see that, it's like both bookends.     You don't have to make the objection, and the only time you do is when the law is unclear; and, that being so, we're going to have everybody doing research about how clear the law is one way or the other, which is going to be tough. But, more importantly, it seems to me what's happening is that 52 is being also used in part to isolate those Peggy Schooner type cases where it is just basically unfair not to apply new law.     And in the words of Justice Marshall, he says that should apply, and sometimes it's unfair not to apply it on the appeal. And -- and so I don't see how you explain Johnson on your theory.       Yes, but the -- the  well, this -- I mean, the trouble is you've run into, like, four different interpretations of what Johnson really means.     And mine, which is, perhaps, no better or worse than the competing ones, is -- is you go back to the Schooner Peggy, and you see the Chief Justice, and he says, in a case the law has changed, the Court must decide, according to existing law, the appellate court; and, if it be necessary to set aside a judgment rightful when rendered, but which cannot be affirmed, but in violation of the law, that judgment must be set aside. So there, we seem to be -- and Johnson seemed to me to bear this out; but, sometimes, you do forgive the need to object because the overriding principle is the principle of deciding the law as it is at the time of appeal, and to do the contrary is just too unfair. Now, that -- reading Johnson that way, I'd say, well, that rule applies here too.       Sometimes.       No, it's not.       Yes.     Yes.     And that's why you make a balance.     And the balance goes -- brings back the first question that I put.     Because, in this kind of a case where the law is unsettled, we have what we'll call the uniform or the hippogriff problem, and that's the problem of it doesn't really make that much difference to the basic policy of objecting. And on the other side, you have the administrative potential mess of having to figure out how clear was the law in the court -- the district court.     Is it a circuit where you'd say the law was absolutely -- is pretty clear that they were right?     Or was it a circuit where it's pretty clear that the law was the opposite, in which case we waive the need?     Or is it actually mixed up and you don't know, in that circuit, in which case you're arguing, don't waive the need.     So I see the unicorn on one side versus an administrative problem on the other.       Then what harm does it do, in the interest of simplicity, in reading a word to mean what it says?     The word is "plain error."     It doesn't say whether they mean plain error at the time of trial, or plain at the time of appeal. Olano says it means plain at the time of appeal.     If we say that's what it means, then that's what it means always.     And what harm will that do, given the fact -- but, still, there's a plenty of a good reason, and appellate judges know their job, not to send things back, where it's some technical matter, where he's trying to sandbag the judge, where, in fact -- now we have all the Rule 4, the fourth prong consideration.       The words mean what they say.       Well, if you agree, then --       That is Mr. Dreeben's excellent argument. And then Olano -- rather, Johnson says the contrary.
11-9335 +++$+++        No, no, it isn't quite.     I mean, the -- the linguistic difference -- I agree with Justice Scalia, and I agree with you.     It turns on the word "exposed."     I mean, if you state Apprendi's holding as it was just stated, this is a different case because you could, in fact, if you were the defendant, have been sentenced to that anyway.     That's your argument.       Now, let's put it differently.     There is a fact in the world.     There's a gun, or there wasn't a gun.     In the Apprendi case, if the fact turns out to be gun, you could get two more years.     All right?     We have to go to the jury.     Now, here there's a fact in the world, gun or not gun. If it turns out not gun, you get a lower sentence, you could.     And, if it turns out to be the fact, gun, you can't -- the judge cannot put you in that box.     He has to put you in a worse box.     He has to put you in a worse box.     He has to give you more than -- more than the three years, two years, or one year.     He has to.     Okay? Now, from the point of view of the defendant, worse or not -- at least as bad.     From the point of view of Congress, same.     They drew some lines, want a judge to administer them, and they turn on facts. And the sentence very often will turn on those facts. From the point of view of the judge, same. It's the jury decides or he decides.     In the one case, his discretion is cut off to give a lower sentence.     In the other case, his discretion is granted to give a higher sentence. Now, I see tremendous similarities, though I grant you the words are different, but can you -- can you just explain --       -- why the difference in the words should overcome the fact that I can't think of a -- of a difference, other than those words that happened to be used in Apprendi?       I'm afraid the other side was upside down, and I saw what you meant.       But --       That's the -- that's the -- you've used all the words, which do make the difference, in your mind.     But my question --       -- is why should those words make a difference? Look, in the one case -- I'll be repeating myself, but I want you to see it.     In the one case, presence of a fact or not means the defendant goes into a higher sentencing box.     In the other case, presence of a fact or not means that he cannot go into the low sentencing box.       In the one case, he cannot go into the low sentencing box; in the other case, he can't go into the high sentencing box.     I got that difference. My only problem is why does it make a difference.       No, it's not -- well, you can call it judicial leniency, but you could call the other judicial harshness.     I mean, what is, in fact, turning out --       And, here, we have the ingredients of a crime that Congress has determined that you have to get the five years.       I mean, in the one case, you can say all that Apprendi did.     It never should have been decided -- I mean, some of us thought that -- because, in fact --       All you're talking about there is that you are stopping the judge from exhibiting his otherwise discretion towards harshness, and that's a matter for judges.     I've heard all these arguments before, you see.       And I've just heard them in the context of harshness, and, now, I don't know why changing it to leniency makes them somehow more relevant.     They weren't apparently relevant in the first situation; so why are they relevant in this one?       Look, look, here's another way of putting the same point:     With the mandatory minimum, the judge can't go below the five years, okay? But you say, well, he could have gone below the five years anyway, couldn't he have?     I mean, you -- he could have given you the five years anyway -- sorry. He could have given you the five years anyway.     That's your point.       All right.     He could have given you the five years -- he could have given you the five years if you'd been -- if you had been convicted of a different crime.       But why does that make a difference?     The best way I thought of putting it is the heading on page 6 of their reply brief is almost right, I think. I mean, I -- it says it's -- it's permitting judges to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence that compels sentences higher than a set of those permitted by the jury's verdict. That's exactly what's going on here.       And -- and I -- I want to know, what is it?     And the trouble is --       You're just going to say, well, he could have given the same sentence anyway.     And I'm going to say, well, so what, why does that matter?       That -- that's -- I don't know if you can add anything to this, but, remember, I agree with you about the history, but I just apply it to Apprendi, too.     So the one --       I thought -- are you sure it was Gertrude Stein and not Dorothy Parker?     But I think you're probably right about that. But the -- the -- I'm thinking of this as, well, Apprendi, I see what they're thinking.     They're thinking that, once you have to add the extra fact to get above the otherwise ceiling, it's like a new crime. It isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime. Okay.     But then I can say, well, once you have to really cut off that five years and less and really send him to jail for five years, hey, that's just like a new crime.     It isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime. So why can't I say everything that we said about Apprendi here, except I can't deny what you say, the judge could have given the sentence anyway.     That's absolutely right.     But all the other things, I can say. Is that true?       But, I mean, are they true? (Laughter.)
11-94 +++$+++        What about the other two? I just -- I was very interested in your colloquy here. You said, well, there were three cases in the 19th century where they did say the jury --       And one of them was a very brief opinion from Massachusetts.       What about the other two?       Both Massachusetts.     Well, it's getting stronger.       So, do you need any more than that?     I mean, do we have to get into this?     Isn't it just a question of whether there is a tradition in the law that juries, rather than judges, would determine what used to be called sentencing facts; facts related not to the crime, but to the imposition of the punishment where that's a fine?
11-9540 +++$+++        But you're not -- but you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed the crime.     You're looking to the factual basis or you look to these other documents in order to decide which crime it was that the offender committed. And the reason that you have to sometimes do that is because there are many State statutes which under a single section number list several different crimes, where "crime" here does not refer to a thing that happened at a particular day at a particular time, but refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines; i.e., a general category. Now, every case that we've written it seems to me says that or is consistent with that.     And that is certainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being burglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes. So the guilty plea is beside the point.     It may just say, guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter. And we don't know which of those three things:     House, car, boat, which are there in that section, was the crime committed.     And he's saying that's the end of that.     And so he says, then, look, this is a California State statute and it isn't divided into three parts.     It just has one part.     And that one part is not the equivalent --       -- of Federal burglary as defined by Justice Blackmun and the Court in this case, end of matter, QED.       That's exactly right.     So therefore, that was my question basically.       And of course Congress knew that there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes with several different words and they -- you know, different ways of getting at the same thing, and therefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal statute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or otherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury. And so if you have a slight variation on the burglary theme, it doesn't fit within generic burglary, but it's pretty hard to imagine it wouldn't otherwise present the same risks, at least if it's only a slight variation.       I know and that was my question.     Why not?       True.     But what they said in Gauze is that the entry must invade a possessory right in a building.     And that cuts in your favor, because that's not having different ways of committing a crime, that's what the word in the statute means.       Yes.     So now you're ahead. But the difficulty I think is, as I understand it, that invading a possessory interest includes -- includes going into a shop with an intent to steal something, a shoplifter.     Now, you could go back to the Blackmun opinion and you can say, ah, that falls right within it, because generic burglary is defined in part there to include generic, an unprivileged remaining in the building.     And you say, you see, these are the same. Were it not for two facts.     The first fact is in Shepard it seems as if the Court says shoplifting is not burglary.     And then you look to the treatise that they cite for that, which is LaFave, and LaFave makes that even more clear.     And says, no, when you talk about remaining, what we're thinking of is hiding in a bank and not going into what used to be Jordan Marsh and staying overnight, or not even staying overnight, but just putting a few toothbrushes in there.       So that's where the problem is.       Ah.     But now, once you conflate those you are back to Justice Sotomayor's problem.       Let me quickly ask you this then, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes clear that in these words of the California statute, there must be an interference with a possessory interest. Now, go back and read the Blackmun opinion, and it says the element of generic burglary includes an unprivileged entry or remaining into a building.     You say now, between those two forms of words, there is virtually no difference.       The one possible difference is shoplifting.       And as to shoplifting, here is what I would like to say.     This is you, okay?     Not me. Shoplifting just is not a factor under California code section 459.     Now, you have not added those last words; and therefore, I begin to think maybe it is a factor.     And if it is a factor, then I'm afraid I'm then leaning in favor of saying there is a big difference in the California statute in generic burglary. But if you could tell me, no, there are other shoplifting statutes, this is never or hardly ever used for shoplifting, then maybe I would feel differently about it, and say, oh, it's close enough.       You see why I turn back to the empirical question and keep wondering, why is it not possible to get, say, a law professor; they have spare time -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to look and see what are the real behaviors that are convicted under section 459.       Well --
11-965 +++$+++        Really, suppose I think that this was crying out for an en banc.     After you got your decision, we decided Goodyear, didn't we?     And yet, even though there is no effort to reconcile the case with Goodyear, as there couldn't be -- we haven't decided it -- by the time we decided it, it still could have been taken en banc.       But I guess we have no power at all to force the circuit, although that's what they are there for, to consider such a matter en banc.       And they didn't raise these -       But, now, we're -- look at the odd thing.     It might not violate the Constitution. I mean, it's the same question, but it is bothering me, too.     It might not violate the Constitution of the United States, for a State to say, we don't have limited liability in respect to the subsidiary corporation or the general corporation. It's very unlikely to do that.     It's going to be a big problem to get investment in that State, but it might not violate -- it might not violate the Constitution as here, to say -- you know, we are, in California, not going to have subsidiaries when a plaintiff comes in and sues on the basis of something that happened outside the country; but we will have it when, in fact, he sues on something that happened in California.     Now, a State could do that, I guess, but it's pretty odd. And if you look what the -- what the Ninth Circuit said in its opinion, it never referred to California law directly.     It's all Ninth Circuit cases or Second Circuit cases.     The only thing it says about California is probably something that was quoted in that circuit case, something like that. So what am I supposed to do?     Because State law is up to the State.     How do I handle that?       So you think, in other words, that California has abolished -- I mean, California says there is no corporate insulation, a corporation, when it tries to work through a subsidiary, that subsidiary has unlimited liability from lawsuits in California?     Is that what you think California law is?       The answer then to my question is yes.     You think right today, in California, the law is there is no -- there is unlimited liability for a corporation that is a subsidiary of another?       Well, you can bring a lawsuit, unlimited liability.       That is my problem, and I don't know what to do.     It's really -- Justice Scalia has been mentioning this problem.     You're seeing it through the lens of jurisdiction.     I'm not.     I'm seeing it through the lens of corporate law.     Five shareholders get together from outside California, and they set up a corporation in California.     Why?     To insulate themselves from liability, particularly lawsuits. Now, instead of those five shareholders, everything is the same, but now, it's a German corporation, and suddenly, they can't insulate themselves from the lawsuits in California.     I think it unlikely that California would have such a corporate law, whether it goes by the name of jurisdiction or some other name, but that's a State law question. So what am I supposed to do?     That's where we started this argument.     And that's what I -       What?       Well, another thing we could do is we could say we've decided, now, two cases that seem to bear on this, and one is Goodyear, and the other is Kiobel; and we could say we'll send it back for consideration of this case, in light of those.
11-982 +++$+++        What is it -- I would like to know.     I mean, I assume you ask them, do you have any current or future plan to produce a shoe that would violate our mark --       -- or that might -- which does not look at all like the present -- your present shoe, and isn't even colorably like your present shoe, do you have a plan to do such a thing, are you in the process, is it likely? And they say, no, it's not likely.     That's the end of it.     They're just as if they manufactured cell phones.       But if they were to say -- you know, we make new shoes all the time.       And this is some kind of thing we might well consider, and we have people working on it; and they are considering whether to do it or not, it's well in the works -- they win.     Okay? What did they say?       What they say is that they changed this at the rate of a mile a minute -- you know, they have -- they have stuff they put out, and we have the YUMS and the Sweet -- whatever it is and the Jelly Bean and so forth, and we keep changing it. And so I don't know.     I mean, it doesn't seem clear, one way or the other.     If it is -- if I come to that conclusion, is it the case -- I thought perhaps, in looking at this, that the line I quoted -- remember, which puts a lot of burden on you, from Friends of the Earth -- is not quoted in the district court, not quoted in the Court of Appeals, so perhaps the thing -- I think the SG wants something like it.       So you say, okay, this is the standard; it's tough for Nike to show this.     You seem to have conducted this case without that standard quite in mind.     It's tough for Nike, but they can do it -- you know, depending on the facts, and you have these protective orders, da, da, da, so send it back, use the right standard, and give Nike a chance and give them a chance, and that way, we --       What about that?     I would like to know what the answer to that question is here.       Excellent.       Well, that's your opinion, that you will win on remand.     Okay.       I would ask Nike, I suppose, Nike could say -- you know, I read the page 73 and you changed things at the rate of mile a minute, and we looked at YUMS and Jelly Bean, and they're sort of like our shoe, but we didn't think enough, but you did think enough, and are some of these changes that could happen at a mile a minute -- is there any reason to think -- you know, that they won't look really colorably even like what you just did, but nonetheless, is a pretty good point that they might infringe our -- our present trademark.       That's a long question, I don't know if I'll get a good answer.       I see that.     But I thought your response to Justice Kennedy was a different one.     I liked it because it was that -- the concern that Nike can go and find out the competitor's plans is true, but it exists whenever a -- a -- a manufacturer brings a trademark infringement case because that manufacturer has to show he is now making the product; or, if not, he intends to.     And if it's a question of intends to, then the defendant can go and look and see if that's true.       And your response, I took it, to that was there are procedures that deal with that.     They're called protective orders and so forth. Is that -- have I got that right with your argument?       That's what your argument is, yes.
11-9953 +++$+++        You also agree, right on this subject, that the only sentence that I can find -- I haven't read it totally carefully -- but, in the lower court opinion, that has to do with this is the sentence I read before. And it says, "The first three years he was incarcerated, he was charged with first-degree murder, and the progression of the prosecution was out of the State's control, as determined by this Court and the Supreme Court." Now, when I look at those words, I am not 100 percent certain what they mean.     So it would be helpful -- but I don't want --- you're not going to do it -- I'd like to -- are you -- would you concede that that statement means they're saying that the State, for speedy trial purposes, is not to be held accountable, really, at all, for not providing the money, insofar as that's a cause of the delay? Is that a conceded point?     Or is that something I have to spend quite a lot of time going through? And, if you don't concede that, what is it that you concede, which would spare a little time going through this record.       All right.       I thought maybe you would not, but -- (Laughter.)       Yes, you are right.     Most of this opinion -- and almost all of it is about the other factors.     Now, I agree with you, that's what it looked like.     But we do have this sentence. So how am I supposed to figure out whether that sentence really means what they say?     Or just is something they threw in to make the opinion more difficult for us to understand?       No, I don't either.     I don't either.     But what's the argument -- sounds as if it has something to do with funding.     So what's the argument it doesn't?       I mean, it says, you see, "as determined by this Court and the Supreme Court." What were they talking about?       Oh, okay.     Well, then, that's it.     They're referring to Barker.     Okay. So when they say it's out of this State's control, as referred to in Barker, which is our case, then what they mean is that it's not something that the State had anything to do with, so they shouldn't be blamed for it.       When you agreed with --       Suppose it is negligent. For -- for a year, this person isn't represented because the State keeps sending the checks to his cousin of the same name.     I mean -- you know, they didn't do it purposely.     He just happens to have a cousin, this lawyer, of the same name, who doesn't tell him he's getting these checks out of nowhere. So he can't hire the expert.     Absolute negligence.     I mean, that's not to be attributed to the State?       Is there any authority for that?     I mean -- you know, maybe you'd discount it because it wasn't deliberate, but no attribution whatsoever?
12-10 +++$+++        But there's no way to separate -- with an organization in the field that does things, there is no way, I don't think, to separate what they do from what they say.     Congress has two opposite views on this in front of it.       One is the view that the Page 34 way to fight AIDS is consistent with and is furthered by longer term efforts to abolish trafficking in women, okay?     Prostitution. All right.     The other view is the better way to do it is to go into the active sex worker area and -- and not express views on the merits of what they are doing, okay? So they have two opposite views, and -- and, moreover, the groups that do this act on those views. So why can't they say, we prefer view A or B, whichever it is, and -- because that's what our program is about?       Only because -- see, it's not -- it's not, in my opinion, not a viewpoint matter, if they're going to fund a -- a group that wants to end discrimination against women around the world because they think all kinds of good things will flow from that. The government wants to fund it.     Of course, such a group has a viewpoint; that's why they're in the business. So the word isn't "viewpoint."     And you started to say something about that there is more than that here, it has to do with the express nature.     And, Page 42 then, in answering Justice Sotomayor, you went a little bit further on that.     And what are the form of words -- if you were me and if I were to decide in your favor, what form of words would you dictate to describe where it is in your opinion that the First Amendment cuts in with a preventative restriction? How do you describe it?     I -- I don't think you can, in terms of viewpoint.       I did, too, because I -- I didn't see the reason.     I thought that was -- I can think of dozens and dozens of programs all over the world that the government supports, in some way or other, and, of course, the people in those programs have a certain viewpoint, and, of course, they don't hold the opposite viewpoint. Otherwise, they wouldn't be in the program. So -- so that's why I didn't find that useful.     But, now, I don't think you can have it both ways between answering these questions.     What is the answer? Page 44       And then they're doing that, they say, because we're part of the belief, as a matter of policy, that the best way to go about this, whether you think so or not, is to restrict the grants to those people who will oppose the long-term extension of prostitution expressly. Now, that's their view of how to get rid of AIDS, you say.     Might disagree with it, but there are plenty of people who think the opposite.     So they're saying we're not doing it for any reason other than to further our policy.
12-1036 +++$+++       Why is that?    I thought that in a -- maybe it's changed since I knew the law in this area.    But I thought because of Illinois Brick the ultimate consumers couldn't recover, but there -- you have to be a direct purchaser rather than an indirect purchaser of the price-fixed good.      Yes.    All right.    So this is a State law case.      I know your case is, but the one that settled previously?      All right.    So you have a double dip claim.    I guess my question procedurally is that here the State of Mississippi is the named plaintiff.      And moreover, the State of Mississippi is suing in order to obtain money, is what we just heard, for its treasury.    And third, the State of Mississippi is suing because of their belief that the defendants injured the economy of Mississippi and they injured it by hurting the pocketbooks of many individuals in Mississippi, the names of whom they don't even know.    All right? Now, they say, look at -- read the statute. Read the cases which say if you are a nominal plaintiff, that's good enough as long as you are not suing as some kind of -- I forget the words -- quasi-sovereign, whatever it was, one way or the other.    You know the cases better than I.    But why isn't what they just said sufficient?      I understand that, but why does that fall within this statute?      What about -- see, I can understand a complaint where they have taken 100 individuals or 102, and they list them as plaintiffs, and they don't call it a class action.    And that would fall right within the meaning of mass action if the numbers are right.      But if we take your approach and depart from that mechanical, but simple -- simply administered interpretation, what was worrying me, and perhaps you can help me with that, is that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where one of the motivating reasons is behind the lawsuit is some person hurt our citizens. And so now we will get into the instantly interesting, but very difficult question of well, when you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by giving them rise to an independent cause of action for each of them, who we don't know who they are and we don't know if the statute of limitations has run to some, and we don't know if others have other disabilities; but, nonetheless, we're not certain this suit is entirely for that.    It may be mixed up with other things. Do you see the problem once I start down your road?      I've departed from the clear and simple.      You can hold him to that, and I guess he can say, no, I don't want to be held to that or -- but that seemed to be not for this Court. Once he says it, I guess -      But can we not take him at his word?    He said it wasn't.
12-1038 +++$+++    To go back to --   The difficulty that I'm having is the Ninth Circuit said the reason that your client won is because the -- the piece of grass between the road and -- and the sign was not -- it was subject to an easement and the government lacked the exclusive right of possession. All right. When I saw that, I thought, well, there -- there are thousands of different kinds of easement, as Justice Kennedy just said. They're there for utilities. They're for -- they're there for people might want to -- I mean, I can imagine a million, as you can, too. So not all of those would involve First Amendment anything, and -- and, yet, the -- the Ninth Circuit would seem to say that your client could go and demonstrate, as long as the utility company had an easement. So how are we supposed to interpret the statute to avoid the First Amendment problem without getting into an interpretation that, to me, would seem ridiculous.   Now, why does the First Amendment allow a person to go to the heart of the military base, put on any demonstration they want, the statute doesn't apply for the reason that, once every four months, the PG&E has an easement to go out and read the meter.   Now, that's exactly -- I know you wouldn't --   -- and that's why I want to know what your position is as to the interpretation of the statute that avoids my absurd PG&E result, but, nonetheless, does what you want, which is to protect the First Amendment interests.   Oh, that's what I don't understand. Let me press -- at the risk of repetition, the reason I'm asking this guestion is the record is not developed. I looked at the Google maps. It looked to me like this area is sort of a suburban house with a lawn in front of it, and you drive along the street, and you suspect that the street may belong to the city a little way up the lawn; but beyond that, it probably belongs to the homeowner. And when you try to see where does the green line cross that grassy area, you can't easily tell, and -- and it may be just a foot or two. So it may have been inconceivable that your client didn't cross the green line or maybe he didn't. I don't know. So, therefore, you're back to a more basic test, and you say, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, if they do not have exclusive control, the military can't enforce this statute. But what do we do, which was my guestion, about instances where the military does not have exclusive control, but the reason it doesn't has nothing to do with roads, nothing to do with green lines, it has to do with thousands of other easements that have nothing to do with this case; therefore, I'm pressing you to get a definition of this statute that will serve your ends without getting into all these other kinds of easements.   And what is that, in your understanding?   It's more than that. It says I mean -- you know, if you wanted to take someone to school. It said -- first, if you need medical treatment, you can just go in, and then it said you -- you have to receive prior written approval from me, the commander, or my designee, but if you get it -- so I suppose if he had a child at the school, he would ask and they'd give it to him. I mean, it didn't seem to me an absolute bar. It seemed to me a bar for purposes of going to that particular --   Do we have to get into any of that? Do we -- just like I don't know where he really was physically. I don't know whether that grass strip is within something, without something. These all sound like First Amendment relevant matters.
12-10882 +++$+++    So what is wrong -- this -- there may be agreement among you on this. What the -- what Atkins says is there are three parts, as you say. One part is significantly sub-average intellectual functioning. That's the first part. And so what you say is, if it's above a 70 on an IQ test, or a couple of them, that's the end of it. We don't go further. All right. What they say is, I want to tell the jury something, or the judge if the judge is deciding it: "Judge, I have an expert here. Thank you." Expert: "I want to tell you, Your Honor, that that number 70 is subject to error." It could be -- and indeed the State can do the same thing. If it's 68, the number 68 is subject to error. So if somebody measures 68 you could bring in the witness, and you would say 5 percent of the time, it's within 5 points either way. I think that's all they want to do. Now, there could be other ways of going about it, and maybe you would give the same test six times with different questions, and that may not eliminate but it might reduce the possibility of error, or there may be some other way to do it. You call in a psychiatrist and he says okay; or an expert: 72, he's still. We have other ways. We have other ways, not just tests. Now, I think you would do the same thing if you wanted to, on the down side, I guess. And that might lead people not to -- to being executed. You see? And that's their position, though, I think. And they get to do it on the upside. All right, what's wrong with that? It doesn't sound so terrible. And anyway, the Eighth Amendment -- this is a way of enforcing the Eighth Amendment. This doesn't need to be, I don't think, an independent Eighth /Amendment violation. But go ahead; that's the kind of question I would love to have some --   It doesn't raise the limit to 75. What it does is it says just what I said, and I don't want to repeat it. When it's there at 70, they call their expert, who informs the decisionmaker just what I said. Now, that would take a little time, maybe 15 minutes, maybe a little longer. But that's what they want to do, I think. And -- and why not? I mean, what is so terrible about doing it?   But only those who in fact are mentally retarded.   Because?   Can you --   What happens if right now, today, under the law of Florida a similar case and there is an IQ score of 71, and the prosecutor points out to the judge that that's higher than 70. And the defense lawyer says: Your Honor, I would like to bring in my test expert here who will explain to you that, even though this test did show 71, there is some fairly small but significant probability of error, and it could in fact be as high as 76, and he would like to explain to you that that's the situation. And therefore, can I have him testify. Does the judge have to let him testify or not?   All right. So then --   So then this is a dispute in the case. They would like to present that expert, you would say no?   Okay. That brings me back to my -- I just want to be sure.   Then we get to my first question, which I won't repeat, and this man has been on death row for over 35 years, I take it?
12-1117 +++$+++    I mean, when I look at the film, I thought well, sure, he's going back to the highway. You say we want to show that the policeman knew he wasn't -- knew he wasn't. I didn't see any evidence showing that preferred or otherwise. Though what you said is there; it doesn't show he knew that the guy wasn't going back to the car. Your second question you raised, which I think is a very good question, why didn't they shoot the tires out? And my answer to that is I don't know. I don't know. I've heard the same thing that Chief Justice has heard, and we've also seen the thing, and I -- of course, it raises just the question you say. But since I don't know the answer, and since there's no evidence in the answer, and since there are no cases dealing with the answer, I begin to think I don't see how, you know, you can say it was clearly established that they had to shoot the tires out. It's a question I don't know the answer to. What am I supposed to do?   Is there -- what is there in the record? When I saw the film, I saw your point. You have a point. But what I can't quite see is how it was a clearly established one. Maybe this is the case where you ought to go, and if you're suing somebody else and introduce a lot of evidence that shows that they should shoot the tires out; and then there could be a decision on that. It comes up every so often. But am I right in thinking so far, there just hasn't been a case on it? There hasn't been an effort to do that. There hasn't -- so I'm left in this uncertainty, which unfortunately for you means it wasn't clearly established.
12-1128 +++$+++       Well, why shouldn't there be?      I mean, why shouldn't there be?    I take what you're saying is that their claim is, look -- you called it claim scope or something.    What did you call it?      Claim coverage.    They say We have a product and it doesn't violate the patent for the reason that the claims in the patent don't cover it.      Now, you want to call that a claim coverage.    I would call it no infringement. Call it what you wish.    But the fact is there are -- and moreover, you couldn't bring a counterclaim because he's already agreed that if he loses his suit, he'll pay you the money.    So there's nothing to claim for.      Yes, I know.    Now, all that's true.      But nonetheless the fact is in many claims -- in many instances, though perhaps not yours, this kind of claim, i.e. that person's patent does not cover my product -      -- is actually a way of saying whether your product infringes the patent, one way of saying that.    So their point is, call it what you wish, but where you have a claim which amounts to a claim that my product does not infringe his patent, the rule that should apply is the person who owns the patent should have to prove that the claims do cover the product. And there are a lot of good reasons, et cetera, that they put in their brief why that should be so.    It's easiest for the patentee to know in what respect it violates the claim.    Normally, a patent, being a monopoly, should not have too many advantages beyond the scope of the monopoly.    And we don't like false patents because that -- you'd have different results in the same kind of patent with different people depending upon whether in some other instance your client brought a suit or whether this was -- I mean, you've read the arguments. So looking at those functional arguments, is there any answer that you have to their point other than cases in different subject matters where burdens of proof did shift?      Well, how -- what do you do with the government's argument here, which I take it as being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I understood it -- which is a big qualification -- the - the -- some of these things are awfully complicated. You might have a -- a claim or really, it's a set of claims that cover 48 pages with all kinds of symbols in -- in 42 different sort of division possibilities. And then the -- the so-called infringer or the person who falls outside the coverage is looking at his product, and it's one of the most complex things you've ever seen.    And he has to think to himself, well, how -- how am I supposed -- how does the claim cover this?    And -- and it's -- there are many, many, many possibilities. I take it that's what they mean when they say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating how the claim limitations map onto the accused product, because infringement may be found only when the product falls within the scope -- scope of the asserted claim or claims in every respect. Your client, who's the patentee, knows that; otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringing suit or the inside-the-coverage suit, or responding to someone who says it's outside the coverage.    But -- but the person who is the alleged infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes sense to put everything in the same place; notice of infringement, burden of production, burden of proof.    And that way, it will be easier to focus on what's at stake. That's what I take it their argument is.    If I've not got it right, you're certainly -      All right.      But do they have to tell them?      They always do?      So that's a good point.    So what you're saying is that page 19 or whatever I quoted is a made-up thing which doesn't ever never really exist in your experience.      Because the first question would be, well, you tell me how -- how this infringes.      So you're saying I don't really care about what is an action where there is an infringement action or there even could be one in the circumstances before us, that's not my case because they're going to pay me forever if they lose this declaratory judgment, so there's no shift.    And where there's no shift, you ought to follow the rules for where there's no shift, which is that the burden lies on the person bringing the suit.      That's your argument.      I -- I see.      And your argument is that the horribles don't exist because the one on page 19 never has come up, and as far as the no -- no res judicata, I don't care because I'll come to the same result with a different means.      And any other -- is there any other -- is there any other practical point that they brought up that you want respond to?      But you would agree with this.    You would agree that if that agreement of yours read a little differently, MedImmune -- if they had said, we are not going to pay royalties until your client brings an infringement suit, which you intend to do, at that point, if you'd made that promise, you would have the burden of proof, because you'd bring an infringement suit.      And if they said either an infringement suit or a declaratory judgment action, then again you would have the burden of proof, even in the declaratory judgment action because then they would be totally parallel.    I mean, then you'd have, if you brought the infringement suit, it's yours.    And then in the declaratory judgment action, it could be true too, in your view.      I mean -      The answer is yes or no. The answer is yes or no.    That is, am I right in understanding your argument that if that agreement had said you can bring either kind of suit, either we, yes, we the patentee, will bring a suit, in which case you will defend it; or if you bring it first, you can bring a declaratory judgment action.    Okay?    For the same thing.    If it had said that and the agreement had held up the royalties until one or the other was decided, then your client the patentee would have the burden of proof in either because it's exactly the same thing. You could have brought -- are you following me?      Okay.    Skip it. (Laughter.)
12-1146 +++$+++    But then they'll -- then they'll be back down to -- to 41,000 people fully within this. And when you get to Number 5, Title V, 6.1 million, that sort of changes what -- I mean, if that's the guestion, does, in fact, this provision give the EPA the -- the obligation to impose permit reguirements on 41,000 businesses of a size that really are -- constitute, at most, 10 or 15 percent of the problem, well, that's -- that's pretty hard to accept.   What I thought the guestion was, was whether EPA had the authority to implement this in a way that EPA itself thinks makes sense, which might be, on their own reasoning, to not impose permitting reguirements on tens of thousands, perhaps millions of small businesses. I thought that was what the guestion was. That did seem to be the way they put it.   Are they going to get some new standards? But are these -- but the words they used in their opinion were streamlining.   The words they used in their opinion implied to me when I read them that they're never going to want to put tiny boilers under this because it just doesn't do very much good and it's expensive to administer. That's how I read it.   All right. So I learned guite a lot from this, and I'd like to learn one more thing, which is, look, 7411, remember what the Chief Justice just said about the 83 percent and the 86 percent. And even if you lose, they still can regulate 83 percent, and if you win, you can regulate 86 percent. And, my goodness, if 7411 is over there letting them do precisely what they want, why do you need this, too? That's the part that I haven't got a clear answer to in 0 my mind.   Well, put those all in. Put those all in. Write -- write complicated standards. Write standards that have certain enforcement capacities and abilities. Write standards that reguire you to get a PSD permit. I mean, what's wrong with all that?   But why? Why does it have to do that? Statutes all the time have implicit exceptions, and not every statute has such exceptions written in words into it. I mean -- you know, it's a classic example, one after another. A statute that reguires animals to pay 50 percent on the train does not apply to snails. Okay. I mean, that's the most common thing in law. So what's the big problem here that everybody seems to have, except me, just about. I mean, what's the big problem with writing an implicit exception so that you don't regulate tiny little things which no one normally wants to have regulated?   And now, my problem is I will hear from many that what I would -- perhaps it isn't a guestion of what I'd like to do. The guestion is, what does the law permit? And therefore, it's helpful if you can or others think of similar examples.   All right. And the other is -- I mean, this is guite -- I see -- I've got it focused now. It seems to me in my mind that we have two guestions, and I think they were well stated by Justice Scalia, actually. The first is, what is the alternative interpretation that doesn't apply it here? And that would be an interpretation that doesn't put greenhouse gases within this PSD provision at all. And that might be really unthinkable -- no, not unthinkable, but have worse conseguences than worrying about the interpretation of this trigger provision. So either we have to do the one or the other. Either we have to interpret the trigger provision with flexibility so that there are written exceptions -- unwritten exceptions in it, one way or the other, or we have to say you can't do that, and therefore they don't apply to all. Which is worse? Is that a -- have I got it right?   Why -- two things. One is, you haven't said anything about the Title V problem, which they said was at 6.1 million persons or individuals or, you know, businesses coming into it. So how do you get them out of that one?   It's the same basic point. Okay. Why -- and there would be a good reason for this, but the bell that it rang is that agencies have tremendous authority about how they distribute their enforcement resources. They don't have to enforce everything against everything. And that is a basic principle. They have to put their money where it will do the most good. And so why wasn't that -- no one's really argued it --   I just wondered. It's sort of like the missing --   Yes.   In other words, you would be out of it totally, and any citizen could go bring a suit and say where is your permit?   I see.
12-1163 +++$+++    Well, they do sometimes. I mean --   There are a lot of areas of the law where they do. I mean, Holmes thought reasonableness, given undisputed facts, is really a question of law. Probable cause matters are really questions of law, if the facts are undisputed. Cases all over the law, there was a case we had -- I had, I saw once, it said, is an Eclectus Parrot a wild bird for purposes of a statute that says wild birds cannot be imported, and the judges there said, Well, is this characteristic factual? Da, da, da. And is this characteristic really -- if you really put your mind to it, you'd have to say that was legal; does "wild" mean in the country of origin or in the country of import? You know, so you could separate it. But there are many, many areas of the law where judges don't bother to separate the two things. And isn't claim construction like that? I mean, you have a case and the claim constructionist always has in mind what this infringing item might be in respect to the claim, and so the judge is always looking at that and doesn't often separate law and fact. I mean, am I -- you know this area better than I do.   So I'm thinking that maybe claim construction is like that very often. Factual matters are there, legal matters are there, and judges cannot always separate the one from the other, or even if they could, they don't feel it's worth the effort.   The problem with -- the problem is -- the one I think that -- that really seems to me at the heart of what you have to decide, is it worth saying to the court of appeals start distinguishing between which of the two categories it falls into. Because the statement that you read, most lawyers would agree with that statement as a general principle. And then the question becomes, well, it's work to decide whether this is purely legal or whether it's legal/factual mixed and sometimes it's one and sometimes the other and they are really no key to it exactly. So what you're doing is saying, in an area where there are a lot of the deferential kind and some of the nondeferential kind, we want to say the Federal Circuit and all the district courts have to stop and figure that thing out, while the other side says, look, just leave it to the district court and tell them to review. Theirs is simpler. What do you say?
12-1168 +++$+++    I'd just like you to go back to Justice Scalia's question for one second. I didn't hear the -- as he was saying that this case is not a protest case, it's simply about calm conversations. And that is what I want to know if the evidence showed that.   No, the evidence upon which Massachusetts based its decision to go to 35 feet instead of 8 feet. There were hearings. Did the evidence show that what was involved was calm conversations between one person trying to counsel another or did the evidence show something else?   What?   Rather -- I note there's some people who are peaceful, in which case I would accept Justice Scalia's suggestion this is a counseling case. But you've cited some other evidence that suggests there were other people who were screaming, pushing and shouting, which sounds like, in his characterization, a protest case. And the reason that Massachusetts found it difficult to write a statute that distinguishes one from the other is? Why do people write statutes that sometimes do not make these fine distinctions? Why did they in this instance?   Could you have written such a statute that would have worked?   To go to -- go back for a second. I see that. Is there anything in the record -- the obvious reason for a legislator, I think -- I did work in the legislature for a while as a staff member -- that you don't write these fine statutes is they won't work. They have too fine a distinction. The activity is commingled. The activity -- all right. Now, I knew you were just going to nod my -- your head as soon as I said that. So I was trying to get you to say it in spontaneously if it's true. Is there anything in this record that suggests that this is one of those cases where it's just too tough to say whether they're counseling somebody or whether they're screaming at somebody, whether they're pushing somebody or whether they're standing near them peacefully? Is there any evidence in the record I could turn to that would suggest that?   She can't say yes if it isn't there, because I'm going to ask her where because I want to read it.   What kind of --   But go back to Justice Alito's first question. Maybe we can make some progress here. The regulation of labor is up to the NLRB. All right. Now, the NLRB does regulate picketing. It does say what you can do and can't do, and the courts have reviewed that. And you -- what standard do courts use when the NLRB decides, in its wisdom and expertise, well, the pickets can go here, but they can't go there. You can do this, but you can't do that. All of which have speech implications. What standard of review do the courts use?   Are you aware of any case -- I'm putting it -- loading it because -- only because to show my ignorance of it -- where the standard has differed from the ordinary APA standard?   Should we create a new standard for reviewing this kind of regulation? I think that's actually a serious question.
12-1173 +++$+++    I got that point.   All right.   All right. Let me put it this way.   But what are the numbers? I mean, look, this is what I'm thinking. This is property law. It's not just a question of trying to work out what the case could or couldn't have stood for. If I try to remember my property class, it vaguely was -- which was a great class, A. James Casner, real expert. And he -- he, I think, said that when you convey subject of divestment, the -- something called season under the common law went to the recipient of the conveyance. But if you conveyed an easement, season did not pass. So in holding that it is an easement, you're holding there was no season, and therefore, it couldn't be a divestiture. Now, whether that's true or not or I've misremembered it, I'd go back to Justice Scalia's question. Is there a single example since the Domesday Book, since Dadonis, since the Bracton, on little to whatever it was, I mean, in the history of the common law up to the present, where a court has interpreted an ambiguous phrase, which doesn't say to grant an easement for one purpose, but not for the other. There may be some, but I didn't notice any cited in the government's brief.   No, I said in any case at all.   Yes, yes. What is the case?   What is the case? I'd like to read it.   Oh, but they had -- they had a different view.   They didn't say it was an easement.   I didn't read what -- it did?   Where do I where is it roughly in your brief?   Oh, all right. Well   I'm surprised that -- but the -- if you think there are some, I'll get my law clerks to look --   Can you imagine or explain to me why a property lawyer worth his salt since 70 years ago or more, 1942, wouldn't have read that case and advised his client, who was buying the land, if the railroad abandons it, it's yours.   Where is some evidence of that?   No, not reasons. I want to know if there's any authority, and then you get to the the reasons.   Well, I see that they do and I certainly think bicycle paths are a good idea, but the problem that I see here is just what Justice Kagan is bringing up; that is, as I read this, I think there might be millions of acres in the last 70 years that have been conveyed. For all I know, there is some right of way that goes through people's houses -- you know, and all of a sudden, they are going to be living in their house and suddenly a bicycle will run through it, which isn't so bad, but I'm concerned about that, and your answer makes me more concerned --   -- because you haven't suggested anything that makes me think there aren't millions and millions of acres involved. Now, what are you going to say that disabuses me of that?   Exactly, because the lawyer would think -- when he reads the case of Great Northern, you think it's an easement.   So how much is that? How much roughly is that? How often has it turned out that there was a conveyance -- after 1942 there was a conveyance of an abandoned right of way by the United States to land that had been previously been granted to a private owner?   How often?   I know you don't have good numbers, but can you give me a rough estimate?   I will say ten times as much reliance on the one side than the other side, is that totally wrong?   That's true, but when you talk about -- I mean, I went and read -- when I read -- I thought your brief was very persuasive but then I read Great Northern and I thought they have -- they are really quoting it correctly. Here's what they said about the cases that you refer to like Stringer, The conclusion that the railroad was the owner of a limited fee -- which was the conclusion of those earlier cases -- was based on cases arising out of the 1871 Act, not the 1875 Act, and the change of policy in 1875 was brought -- was not brought to the Court's attention. And then they say that conclusion is inconsistent with the language of the 1875 Act. It's history. And it's early administrative interpretation. We therefore do not regard this earlier case as controlling.   Well, I thought they say in the Stringer case. Is that same as --   Yes, that's the one you were --   That's -- that's basically my problem. I guess you just don't have any specific things of what property lawyers were saying. But those two cases are from the era of Stringer, and at that point, apparently, the Court thought it was a limited fee.   And then you get -- they were all -- was any of them after Great Northern?   So -- so then in Great Northern it comes along?   Can you think of anything I can do about this? It's a case, in my mind at least, where reliance interests on -- on a previous case in the property law area are important, and yet none of the briefs here really gives me a -- a reasonably concrete idea of how much reliance there has been. And -- and --   So I'm somewhat in the dark.   Doesn't Interior or some -- I mean, doesn't the highway -- aren't there people in the government who keep track of where the highways are built?
12-1182 +++$+++    Well, they don't know exactly how to do it. I mean, this is a tough problem. So it sounds as if what you're making is a procedural objection here, to which the government's point was, you're right, we'd all been talking about this. We wanted to see what the States would come up with, so we look. The States haven't come up with enough, in our opinion; and so, now, we go to the Federal process, and we put out our thing, and you comment on that. And then, if you feel that their thing is no good, propose your own solutions again. That's what he's saying. But it's supposed to advance the ball. So there is a procedure for the States to come in, if they can come up with a better plan, that's what you've just heard, and so do it. So what's -- what's arbitrary or capricious about such a system?   Well, they objected it once. Now, they think it works here. I mean, all the time it happens, that people change their minds about how problems are best solved, or they cite this problem's better solved one way and better another way. So if your only point is, once they did it a different way, they'll say, well, what's unreasonable about changing our way? We're trying to get the job done.   Well, years and years, the neighbor board -- the labor board decided things in adjudications, rules. One day, they say, no, we think we should preside rulemaking processes, like other agencies. Does anything in the law prevent that?   But they may not know -- you know. They may not know. There's six States that contribute to the seventh State's pollution, and how much each State can cut back depends. It depends on what it costs. It depends on how much they contribute. It depends upon what the other States will do. It depends upon where the wind blows, and that changes all the time.   So they have a tough problem. They can't tell you exactly how much you should cut back until they know what they have in mind or what others have in mind for solving the problem. So it sounds to me as if you're asking them to do the impossible, and they'd had a very good reason for not doing what they did before; namely, it would be impossible here to have a -- or not actually impossible, but very tough and very expensive. So that's why, I gather, they went the way they did. Now, I don't know anything in the law that tells them that this statute was meant to force them to proceed in a way that would either be hugely more expensive and perhaps impossible. What's your -- what's your reaction?   Now, it turns out -- it turns out that EPA, which is in charge of preventing the overgrazing, discovers that, if the sheep men build a fence, that will cure the problem, even though they only contribute half or maybe less. Well, if we bury it -- you know, we divide it egually, you each have to pay -- you each have to cause half the problem because that seems fair, it's going to end up that the people in State A with the cows, they're going to starve to death. So our choice is between taking two people, two States, each of whom cause half the problem and getting an overall plan where you solve the problem at minimal cost or just dividing it 50/50, which seems fair in mathematics, but leads to starvation, cost and death, et cetera. Do you see what I'm driving at? And that's what they've done here, the second method. They -- rather the -- they're not treating each State alike, you are right. And the reason that they're not treating each State alike is they know, one, all the States are partly responsible in more than one percent, and with this plan, we get the job done at much lower cost. Now, where in the statute does it say they can't do that?   On that point -- now, you remember, please, that -- that my cow/sheep example was meant to pick up precisely the disproportion that you're talking about. And -- and keep that in mind because I found it a helpful example. Now, my point is, did you find in Congress -- and I'm interested in legislative history -- did you find anything in the legislative history that suggests that, where the EPA faces this kind of regional problem, and it's a regional, not just a statewide problem, that people in Congress thought they had an answer or a glimmer of an answer, as opposed to taking this language, which is pretty open, and saying, we're going to leave it to -- we don't know, we don't have a clue. The EPA is there to figure this thing out, and we're giving them a broad authority here. Is there anything that cuts on your side that you see, as opposed to the other side of reading this language?   Yes, but you're -- I mean, you want me to write -- look what I would have to write, if I made it very specific. Two units floats over the air from the cow State. Two units floats over the air from the sheep State -- or three. It happens that, if we treat them alike, we're going to tell the cow State, your unit is the same as the sheep State's unit, both make the same significant contribution, and we have to say that, even if for you to remit your unit causes death and destruction, destroys your economy, see, and I have to write those words to accept your argument, don't I? Because --   Of course.   Well, I'm trying to use the most -- I'm trying to use the most extreme words I can, so that, then, you will either have to draw a distinction or something. That's why I'm --   All right. So there's an ambiguity here because, I mean, when you use the word "amounts," I think it does help you. Add the word "amounts" to "significantly," and I think that Justice Scalia's point might be -- he knows it better that I -- an amount is an amount. An amount is an amount. That's what you want to say.  That's my point exactly. Yes. Yes. It is. And then the -- the response is, well, not always because you say, an amount, you're talking about a specific amount coming out of a State, and is the one -- the cow one, as significant as the sheep one. All right? And that's, I think, where -- I think you hit the nail as to what the issue is.   As in the answer is that some one point --
12-1184 +++$+++    Why does it always have to be objectively baseless? I mean, I've read enough cases in this area to be able to approach it as a district court judge who's not expert. I patent the following: For a computer, enter somebody's name; ask phone number, and they'll give you the phone number if you put in the right city. That puts some lists in the computer. They can patent that? Well, you add a couple of things, and then, apparently, you can have an argument that they can patent it. Okay? Because it'll be very abstract language. It will be able to patent almost anything. No, you can't finally, but objectively baseless? Patent attorneys are very brilliant at figuring out just how to do this. So we're never going to have attorneys' fees in a suit if that's your standard.   But you could couple that with just barely over the line. What line? This vague line, no one knows what it is. In addition, all they did was say, We don't want to go to court and cost you $2 million. Please send us a check for 1,000, we'll license it for you. They do that to 40,000 people, and when somebody challenges it and goes to court, it costs them about 2 million because every discovery in sight. Okay? You see where I'm going?   And so I do not see why you couldn't have an exceptional case where attorneys' fees should be shifted. But if I'm honest about it, I cannot say it's objectively baseless. I can just say it's pretty close to whatever that line is, which I can't describe and look at all this other stuff. Are you going to say that I can't shift?   No, no, but I'm -- of course, it may be a small slice of litigation, but it is a slice that costs a lot of people a lot of money.   And so I would like to know if I do run across that small slice why cannot I, the district judge, say, I've see all these things, taken together they spell serious injustice, and therefore, I'm shifting the fees. Okay? Why can I not do that even though, as I've just said and repeat, I cannot in honesty say it's frivolous given the standards for patenting that seem to be administered?   Not nothing there. It's highly abstract language. I gather you, like I, have read some of these claims. They are very hard to understand and when you get to the bottom of it, the abstract nature of the language, plus the fact that it has something to do with computer input, plus the fact that, you know, you suspect very strongly it's baseless, but you really don't like to say something that isn't true and you can say, well, I could see how somebody might think there was something to this claim, just in that tone of voice, which you can't write down that tone of voice. You see? (Laughter.)   Yes. You see the problem. I don't see why it shouldn't be --   Well, let's send it back and tell them that they were imposing a standard that was too narrow, that was -- didn't take count of all the circumstances where something could be unusually --   -- unjust, and then let them, no clear and convincing, but it's up to you, district judge. You're the expert on litigation. You decide.   That's true, but you could then appeal. I mean, you're making an argument on the merits there. And really the question is, is who's better suited to figure out whether this is a -- whether this is a really special case. And if, you know, of course, you're right. Plaintiffs are often right in these things, and sometimes they are wrong. So -- and they costs everybody a lot of money. So you go to the Federal Circuit and ask them to review it for an abuse of discretion.   Yeah, but the -- the difficulty here, I not -- see it from my point of view for a second. Of course I think that -- that there's no plaintiff/defendant necessary difference of who can act badly.   All right. And -- and so the question is really who is likely most to know. And I think probably the district court. But then if you give the power to the district court, there's a problem, of course, that you'll abuse it. So I say, Well, then go to the Federal Circuit, and say they have. You see, well, there's another way of approaching it, and that is have definite standards, which is what you want. And then the difficulty with definite standards is I can't think of a set of definite standards that doesn't do what you don't want to have happen, that it leans one way or the other. I mean, it looks as if, you see, the Federal Circuit's current standards leaned pretty much against the person who was sued. And it looks like the -- the -- and so the government comes up, well, we can't do better than this. It's a long list. And -- and nobody's been able to think of some, so then I say, Okay, let's try the first approach, which is what we do with the Lanham Act. That's the whole long story. And what you would like to say, I'd like to listen.
12-1200 +++$+++    You're saying basically, I think, the words are, for core proceedings, it gives the power to the bankruptcy judge to hear and determine.   And if I tell the assistant chef, you deal with orders for bacon and eggs, that might mean that the assistant chef can deal with eggs orders alone, or it might mean only those that order both.   That's why I thought perhaps it's ambiguous.   It's true, but if you were in the Ninth Circuit, and I would have -- you would have thought this was a core proceeding.   So he says, you know, of course I didn't object. I am faced with all kinds of precedent that say it's impossible; and therefore, there is no reason to object. That wasn't consent.
12-123 +++$+++        No, no, but there's a similar -- I mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying, that underlying this their clients think this whole raisin program is unconstitutional.     What it does is it takes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the river.     And in the thirties, that was done to raise raisin prices. And they think as a matter of policy that just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of constitutional law it takes raisins from some people that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose. Page 37 Okay, that's their view of it, something like that, isn't it?       Fine.     So they're making that kind of constitutional claim.     Now, I would think if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim that should be made in a Federal district court, period, not the Court of Claims.     Because their government isn't going to compensate them for anything.     That's against the whole point of the program. Either this program is valid or it isn't. And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should tell us that.     So I have a feeling this is somehow not a right fit with the Court of Claims. Now, you explain to me why that purely instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.       The just compensation, I take it, in the program is supposed to come from the fact that raisin prices go up.     So the poor children with their noses pressed to the glass because they can't pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are paying the compensation.     And certainly not the taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I don't know.     But I can't believe that Congress wanted the taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean they have to pay higher prices as consumers.       No, no.     No, it doesn't go to the merits.     It goes to whether or not it makes sense to think that the Court of Claims has something to say Page 44 about this.     And suppose we did this.     Suppose we said, given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it was -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we think this is the kind of program and challenge to the program where there isn't going to be a remedy really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all. So tell me why not.       No, no, we'd say -- we'll say given the way that we've talked about the program, perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully.       Yes.       What does the word "acquire" mean.     There is some opinion here which says these handlers acquired the raisins.     What is -- what's that about?       Like lessees or something, bailees?       I -- no, no.     I just wanted to know what the word "acquire" --       Now, can an acquirer of my car, for example -- I don't know.     Forget that.        Can they -- can they assert a takings claim attaches to the car?     It sounds like a standing question.       No, no. But still, it might if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay? They think this program is unconstitutional because it takes some other people's property, right?     So those other people are in a very special relation to them. Those other people are really close. And it may be they have standing to assert those other people's claims.     And if they do have standing to assert those other people's claims, why can't they make the argument that way?
12-126 +++$+++        So does this boil down to -- I mean, you have a one-year statute of limitations.     Now, I guess -- suppose Hurricane Katrina came along and threw all the documents away for two months.     I guess the Court could extend it, couldn't it?       Yes, I mean, don't they toll it when there's some -- when the courthouse burns down?       All right.     So you want to say and that's also true when the person is actually innocent, if you can prove that, delay it.     Is that what you're saying?       Well, he has his one year, and he gives four criteria, and the four criteria, sometimes, are not exclusive.     And you want to say yours is one of the times.       And a different one you say is when he's actually innocent.       All right.     If that's correct, then suppose that he purposely has delayed filing this until everybody's dead, so they know they can't prove it anymore.       Well, what is your answer?       All right he, can he toll it under those circumstances?       So the answer is, in your view, if he deliberately and -- and, without cause, delays it for 5 years, his filing, just so everybody will die, you would say, okay, I'm not worried about him?       Is that right?     Would you, or wouldn't you?       Does he win or lose?       I mean, what do you think?       I didn't ask that.     I said what do you think?       Yes, you do.     I made up the hypothetical. (Laughter.)       But they admit --       I'm just trying to -- they admit that, if he's diligent, it's okay?       Yes.       Do you believe he's diligent?       So the State is asking for a diligence requirement.     You admit that there's a requirement that -- that you have to not really use this as a sham device, so we're pretty close.       But there is a sham -- there is a sham and deliberate delay requirement, not a diligence one, but there is a sham.     I'm not trying to trick you.       What I'm trying to say is maybe we're arguing about something that we could solve; that is, in fact, many of these people don't have lawyers.     They don't understand the statute of limitations, they don't understand what diligence might consist of looking later.     You agree that it's -- it shouldn't be a sham, shouldn't do it deliberately. All right.     Now, if I'm thinking about that, how would you advise me to write it?
12-1281 +++$+++    What happened in that period at around 1970 is that's about the first time that you have intra-session -- an intra-session recess that's longer than an inter-session recess. And so now if we look from 1970 on, that's fairly common. And so all that's happening is that the Presidents are appointing recess appointees during periods where they are out for a longer time. Now, how are we supposed to go and say that this thing -- thousands of people on the recess part -- is unconstitutional? I mean, it isn't unheard of. What about the Due Process Clause? Does that easily cover the language? Substantive due process. What about the Interstate Commerce Clause and the doctrine of -- you know, the implicit clause there? I mean, it isn't unheard of that over time language in the Constitution takes on a somewhat different meaning.   How do we -- I mean, probably different judges have different approaches. But if I'm concerned about the basic practicality and the basic objective here, why would I agree with you?   If I do place more weight on this, should we -- I mean, I do believe and agree with you to this point that this is basically a matter of politics for other branches basically. That doesn't help me resolve this. But it does lead over to this possibility. Congress did pass the No Pay Act. And then they passed the Pay Act. And in that Pay Act on this "happen" part, which I think is the strongest -- very strong for your side, but it defines the vacancy in terms of 30 days prior to the recess. And that would take care of most of these. You see, if vacancy could be defined as something that stretches, because Congress says it stretches in terms of pay for 30 days.   What do you think of that? And I would love to know what the SG thinks of it.   The third question, by the way, just put in your mind, if you digress in your answer, put in your mind what would have happened in 1830 if someone, when they had a 9-month recess, close to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess appointments. What would we be saying then?   Actually, I think I remember what they were --   And in fact -- in fact, I couldn't figure out what they were talking about.   Do you want to say anything before the -- about the -- the language on the "happen," I support you. But the -- the practice, and in particular, the practicalities, because you say, well, the President can make an acting appointment, make a recess appointment even. I mean -- you know, they have much less authority, somebody appointed in that way, much less than a person who's been confirmed by the Senate. So if the government won't grind to a halt, it still faces a problem.   What do you want to say about that?   That's the end of it, exactly the same, if this all took place during the 9-month inter-session recess in 1835.   No, no, no. Exactly, same facts. Same facts.   And, therefore, in your view, the clause, even if they were all scattered to the winds in 1835, there would have been not possible for President Andrew Jackson, if I have that right, to make the recess appointments.   Yes. But your view would be the Court should reject it.   You say anything that would -- on this, if you want to, that would turn it back to the practicalities. Imagine, hypothetically, that I would have thought President Theodore Roosevelt acted unconstitutionally when he tried to make all of his appointments, dozens and dozens, during a two-second --   Yes, yes inter-session --   Yes, yes.   And by converse reasoning, the Congress would not have been able, in 1835, to prevent recess appointments simply by having a nearby senator show up for a -- for one second, once every 3 days, over a 9-month period. It seems to me what goes around comes around in this -- in this --
12-1315 +++$+++    I take it, in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, your position -- tell me if I'm wrong -- is, of course, the defense laches in principle applies, but the defendant will lose because the plaintiff did not wait an unreasonably long time.   She waited a reasonably long time, for the reason that Justice Ginsburg gave.   I thought you might agree. (Laughter.)
12-133 +++$+++       Before you get to that, I have two questions.    One is on the point you've just made because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite how it works. Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in Lending Act -- you know, something like that, and the claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so. And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me the $10,000.     Now, he happens to come up with a theory that is really far out; and the more far out the theory, the harder it is to prove.    And the harder it is to prove, the more you need expensive experts. And do we go case by case, saying -- you know, where you have a really weird theory that's going to require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to follow it in this instance, but everybody else does. Now -- now, is -- is that something, in other words, we're supposed to look at case by case, which would produce the odd result I suggested?     Or do we do it by categories?     How does the doctrine work?       No, what I'll do because I work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case, but yet not quite speculative.     In other words, what I'm trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an arbitration clause if you can get a case that's expensive enough, and there we are. I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen enough to know how it does work.     And I guess you haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that.      Well, that doesn't seem right to me.    Now, Hovenkamp would be the person I would hire as the arbitrator.    So surely he does know -- or Phil Arita -- a blessed memory.    And they're under the instruction to get this done cheap.     Well, I think that might be possible. That might be possible because it's only the question of damages that's tough here because if you don't have the double -- there's only one monopoly profit at the two levels, da, da, da, and we don't need to go through that. But I can think of a way of getting it done pretty cheap.    But regardless, your expert here didn't talk about the cost of arbitration.    He did use the word once.     But as I read pages 88 through 92, it seemed to me he was talking about the cost of litigation, not the cost of arbitration.    And -- and I wouldn't proceed necessarily with all those reports he does to impress to the jury, or even the judge. This is Phil Arita.     You don't need to impress him.     And -- so, so, so -- hasn't the Second Circuit looked, assuming your doctrine's in place, to the wrong set of costs:     The cost of litigation?     Even though they use the word "arbitration," that isn't what your expert told me.       In arbitration or in court?       Does he take into account the fact that the arbitrator can be him?     And moreover, could, in fact, work under an instruction keep these costs down?       No, that isn't the point. If I were doing this offhand, I would say everything is conceded, but for one thing:     Since there is no double monopoly power, there is only one monopoly power at the two levels which can be exercised, the only way the person is damaged is if in fact you've raised entry barriers.     So you'd say to the plaintiff, how are you going to prove that?     And you'd read it and submit a report. Now, I'm not saying this is the right way to go about it.     All I'm saying is it's hard for me to figure out on the basis of that affidavit, which talks about courts, why this has to be so expensive.     So what do I do?       One other thing which I didn't understand, and that's why I am asking.     What they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court. All right. Now, I don't know where that power comes from.     So if you were going to improve this contract in the direction that you would like, why couldn't you sever the part about the confidentiality, or why couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big merchants. Like, I don't know -- probably, you have maybe Costco, maybe Walmart, maybe -- you know, these people are not without money.     Though your client, may be.     But -- go get these contributions.     Go for -- there are many ways you can treat this particular set of words in the arbitration clause, short of severing it entirely. And -- and what about that?     What's your view on that?     What do you think?       Sorry.     But I mean -- you know, hire -- whatever it is, if those are obstacles, it's pretty well established, I think, that that arbitration is not something that you can use to vindicate the Federal claim.     And the part that's bothering me about this, though, is that those aren't obstacles. It's just you brought a very expensive claim.     And the real problem here is the reason they can go into court is they can get a class action in court. And then this Court has said, you can't get the class action in arbitration.     There we have it. So -- so the -- the question in my mind is, well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects of class action can be used in an arbitration that does not formally have a class action?     And there it seems yours is a good case because a lot of them can.     You say, well, the one part that can't is getting this private information. So maybe we should send it back and say, well, why do you need the private information?     On a good theory of antitrust, you're going to show that the price of the Tide product was higher than what it would have been had the entry barriers not been raised from the Tide.     That's a general entry question, which I don't think you need private information from them to answer.     But that's -- and now we're really into the depths of the merits. So I thought of sending it back and saying, let's -- let them explore this kind of thing about other ways of trying to get some of these advantages of class action into your -- you're going to say I'm too far out on this.       Expert costs.       This is exactly -- I found no authority for the proposition that what hinders -- plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to arbitration if the fees involved are too high because he's blocked. But you're quite an advance over that.     You are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of experts and others. Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in practice we have reversed in many, many cases the proposition that you can, in fact, require Federal causes of action to be arbitrated because all you have to do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a theory of your case which is hard and complicated to prove.     Now, you are back in court. Now, that's a significant erosion, it seems to me.     So I want to know if you have any standard there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact you are trying to reverse in practice what was the holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of action.     What is going on here? And an addendum to that is if you are going to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a sharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the expert fees, which is of course a much more pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely?       That's a long question, but do you see what I'm driving at?
12-135 +++$+++        Well, I don't think so. I thought it said that -- that the award -- if the award displays manifest disregard, or words like that.     I mean, Misco is -- is not absolute.     Misco has a narrow exception, and that exception is where there's just no basis in the contract for the decision.     And so I thought you were arguing that here that's clearly not so, there is a basis.       That's a different thing, that's a different thing.     It doesn't say whatever he says about the contract, he wins.     It says what he says about the contract, it is not just manifestly wrong, it isn't just plain language to the contrary, and et cetera.     There is language in the cases to that effect. So I would be repeating myself, but are you saying there is no loophole no matter how tiny?     That's news to me.       All right.     Suppose I think, since I wrote the words in First Options, that something like manifest disregard or totally ignoring plain law is a ground for reversing an arbitrator, even an arbitrator.     Now, suppose I think that.     Then do I decide against you?       Look, I'm going to say something and you are going to say, that's right, that's just what I wanted, and that won't do me any good if you don't think of it.     The arbitrator in front of me, so you better tell me why I'm wrong because they certainly will and they are in the briefs. Mr. Arbitrator, this class -- this language here says all disputes will go to arbitration.     It doesn't say whether they are supposed to be class or can be or can't be.     You decide what it means. And the arbitrator thinks, hmm, all, hmm, it doesn't say, but I got to reach a decision.     So what kind of a case is it?     Small claims.     And then it says something about court suits where they have class.     Hmm, gets his magic 8-ball out and, whatever it is, he says, that's what it means.     It means it could include class, too.     Okay? Where in our case law is that a manifest disregard?     He's looked at the language, there were two plausible constructions, he came up with one of them. What's the problem?     Now, that's of course their problem, but if you just say yes and don't go into why they are saying no it's not going to help me.       So -- obviously you don't. (Laughter.)       Use whatever word you want. Manifest disregard, stick to the law.     Now, suppose the arbitrator had said this, it doesn't say how to do it. I see how you do it, you get out a magic 8-ball.     Now, we would strike that down because that is not relevant. But he didn't say magic 8-ball.     He said class.     And there are many class arbitrations.     So it isn't quite magic 8-ball. Now, you explain to me --       A magic 8-ball is you have -- that's a little thing, it's the -- it's a non-sportsman's equivalent of throwing darts. (Laughter.)
12-1371 +++$+++    Excuse me. If you look at the history of it, it's certainly true that Congress did intend to get misdemeanor domestic felonies. That's what they said. And as it works out in the States, if you take the same definition in, there would be very, very few States misdemeanor of domestic violence that would be covered.   I can't believe that Congress wanted to write a statute that did so little.   Some people who don't read legislative history don't know that, but if you did read the legislative history, you would see that they do want to have an effect with this statute.   Well, on your reading, what would it have accomplished?   I agree with you. I agree with you on the tough -- what they were thinking. But now what I want to know, and you've read all these briefs and -- and you've actually done a lot of work on this. So -- so if you adopt your definition -- you know, making them parallel, how many State domestic violent misdemeanor statutes, in how many States would this cover it, in your opinion.   Please.   That's true, and that's what I was trying to get at because it seems to me that some of the -- quite a few, actually, of the statutes that they cite have different categories and some of the categories would escape being covered by offensive touching and others wouldn't. So I thought you might -- on that assumption, if you win this case, then how many States would be -- how many States would have written their statutes so generally that it wouldn't fall within the scope of the provision we are talking about in your opinion?   When you say "substantial," I mean, you've read all these and do you have he an idea of --   You've thought about this question, so you must have some rough idea. You could put a range on it.   Yes.   Let's assume, just to help for a change -- I mean, not for a change, you help a lot. But the question in my mind is, can you imagine losing this case, hypothetically, just on a hypothetical, and that the Court were to say, just what Justice Scalia said, and the offensive touching does not fall within the definition of physical force, but touching that produces violent injury does. Now, were we to say that, then can you give me a rough answer to my numerical question?   See, what we do is where it's -- where it's separable, where it comes in two separate clauses, then modified categorical approach applies. And -- and that being so, the only States where domestic violence wouldn't be included would be those that have a crime and use general language that you can't divide in the statute and cover both bodily injury and offensive touching. And are -- are there some such States? There must be some --   Well, how -- now, just drawing on your criminal justice experience, say whether my sentence I'm about to utter is true or false. That's what I'd like to know. The -- the many statutes, which include in the same section, the physical injury and the offensive touching, such as Arizona, you intentionally or knowingly cause physical injury or knowingly touching another person with intent to injure, insult, et cetera. What we will find when we look back at the record of the prior convictions, it will say charge Arizona revised statute 13-1203(a) , pled guilty. And we'll have no idea which it was. And -- and that is a general problem with this area. We'll have no idea. Now, is that generally true what I've just said, or false?   Then I don't see -- I think it is generally true, too, and I can't work this out. I mean, we'll work it out, I'm sure. But look, on the -- on the one hand, if you just can't know, as is often true, then on the one hand, you're not really picking up serious domestic violence. You see where there was serious domestic violence. And -- and although it was under a general charge and so the person has a gun. Even did he really beat the spouse up and so forth. Or on the other hand, you pick up the offensive touching, too.   So what do we do?   Yes, yes. So what is your view after all this practice in this area? What would you recommend?   Can you remind me of something which I -- if you interpret this broadly, to include battery, suppose you do offensive touching. Then one consequence is that the person cannot later carry a gun, is that right?   Is it also the case that there would flow ineluctably an extra year 15-year prison sentence, or not?   No. The only consequence is that he couldn't carry a gun.   I mean, if you'd say yes, contrary to your argument, the same words do mean something differently in the two sentence -- in the two sections. Physical force means one thing for this purpose; the other for the other. I'm not saying I would do that. I just say if that happened.   And if that happened, and you defined the physical force in the misdemeanor section as much broader, would in fact there be a consequence for anyone, other than not being able to carry a gun? I just want to have every possible consequence in my mind.   No, no. It's different definitions for the same word in the two provisions. And that's what I want to be absolutely sure; there is no consequence other than the fact that he would not be able to carry a gun.   Yes. There would be a penalty, but would it be an enhanced penalty?   It wouldn't be the extra 15 years you would get for violent felonies.
12-138 +++$+++    Everybody's getting to the same question, I think, but I haven't quite heard the answer. Of course, you're right in many countries. The question of arbitrability, that is to say, is there a contract is for the Court. In an investment treaty, I can find a lot of authority that says whether this counts as an investment is a matter for the Court. But the question in front of us, is this that kind of decision? Is it one for the Court? Or is it one for the arbitrator? And to just summarize why it might be for the arbitrator, A, it's procedural, but that's not sufficient. B, it refers to UNC -- whatever it is -- UNCITRAL?   Yes. It refers to their rules. Their rules provide all matters of competence over the arbitrator. The scholars have done exhaustive work saying most countries think that. The Doctrine of Competence-Competence goes further, and you also have the AAA rules which say the same thing. So those are all against you. For you is the position of the -- the item in the document, first and foremost. All right. I'm trying to summarize what I've got as the arguments for and against. Now, what do you say to make me think there's even more for --   So I agree that's not   But those are not relevant -- I mean, those are relevant. I'm saying they would farther. And I think, in what I've seen so far, it gives, on certain kinds of procedural gateway questions, deference to the arbitrator, which is what is at issue here. And now -- now, I'm back to the same question. What is your evidence from this contract that this is not the kind of gateway question that is for the arbitrator?
12-1408 +++$+++    It is, but it -- really, if you have anything -- the definition is very broad. I mean, it says "'wages' means all remuneration for employment." All remuneration -- wages means all remuneration for employment paid basically for any service of whatever nature performed by an employee. Now, I agree with you that it's the same definition for the withholding. But Congress, it passes the withholding change with conflicting interpretations. So it wouldn't be the first time that Congress passed a statute to say: We don't care what the conflicting interpretations are; ignoring that, you are going to withhold this money, period. And it said, whether it's other than wages or not. I grant you, they might have thought they had to pass it, but so?   We could also look at it as they didn't have to pass it. It was subject to withholding anyway.   Well, no, there would have been a need, if different people think different things. So you want to be sure.   I mean, Congress does that quite a lot. It -- it -- on certain, different people tell them different things. They say, we don't care; do it anyway. And that's what this statute basically says: Withhold anyway.   And maybe -- could we say that? Could we say, well, in our opinion you are right. Both statutes cover supplemental unemployment benefits. It's never come up in the other context since this because Congress wanted to be sure it was withheld.   I'll take it that you're right, that the Congress that passed the withholding statute thought it fell outside of the definition of wages, but they were wrong. Now, that wouldn't be the first time either. So -- but Congress did think it. So what weight am I supposed to give to what Congress thought then about what an earlier Congress, namely, the Congress that passed the wage definition in the withholding statute thought?   Well, yes. But that was so much the more so, you see? They had authority saying it wasn't wages. That doesn't mean that authority was correct. And -- and so that's why they passed the statute.
12-142 +++$+++        I see that.     But I don't understand why that matters.     That is, the -- I mean, I was thinking just what you said.     I was thinking well, I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay? So I lost, I lost.     The -- the -- the point is that -- that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if there were no warning here at all, then it would be unreasonably dangerous. I think, yes, that probably applies to chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it probably applies to all kind, but you see, says the defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use it.     And as you say, that would be not -- it would be despite or whatever it is, despite, not because. But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous, too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning. Chemotherapy is what I'm thinking of.     But properly labeled they're not, and so that seems to be your case.       Because -- why?       In other words, in this case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there is no such warning that could make a difference, that's what they're asked to find?       Where is that?     That's -- I do see that distinction.     If, what you're -- but look, the complaint's filled with words about adequate warning, no adequate warning, no adequate warning, da, da, da.       Okay.     Now what you're saying is, is really what the jury found, nothing to do with adequate.     There is no warning in the world that anybody could have invented that would have made a difference.     I'll have to think about that one.     But in the meantime, where is it that that's what they said?       Yes.     How do I discover that you're right about this?     Because everything in the -- in the complaint that I've read so far seems to talk about the adequacy of warnings, not that there is no warning in the universe could possibly have made a difference.       How do I discover that?       The second point is a different point.     The second point is, look, I have chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10.     All right. If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label explaining the whole thing, it doesn't.     It isn't unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and they could perhaps wouldn't find it. All right.     Now, you can call that diminishing or you could call it adequacy.     Call it what you want, but that seems to me to come to the same thing and is different from saying, no label in the universe would say it.       We're talking about what juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are. That's why I said let the FDA say it.       Well, but then if you apply this -- what is deeply bothering me in all these cases, and it's why I came up and said, the FDA has to tell us -- you know.     Because just what you said before; what you say applies to sulindac also applies to 12 people who will tell the Mary Hitchcock Hospital up in Dartmouth that they can't use a certain kind of chemotherapy. You see, you could in certain horrible cases find a very sympathetic plaintiff who really did suffer terribly.     And -- and -- and you are getting 12 people rather than the FDA.     So my solution to it, which you know because you read Medtronics, may not work, but it's the best I can think of. Now, what -- what -- you can tell me if you want, no, there is some totally different thing.     But what you are saying at the moment, what I do in my mind is I say, beware because it's also true potentially of some of these life-saving drugs and that's what's worrying me.       But even the compensation, suppose you had strict liability that Florida Avocado Growers could -- what they have to do, all they have to do since they can just be fined and the money would go to pay the consumers of California who have the unfortunate mixup sometimes of eating Florida avocados. I mean, that would raise at least serious problems of -- commerce clause problems and preemption and so forth.
12-144 +++$+++        What the brief says is, of course, you can appoint people.     It's not just that you appoint them, it's that the State's interest when it defends a law is the interest in executing the law of the State.     So all you have to do is give a person that interest.     But when a person has the interest of defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of the State of California, there can be all kinds of conflicts, all kinds of situations. That's what I got out of the brief.     So give the person that interest.     And that, they say, is what's missing here.     And you'll say -- I mean, that's - that's here, and you say it's missing here.       Why is it missing here?       Well, the argument -       What is the one -- look, a State that does nothing for gay couples hurts them much more than a State that does something.     And, of course, it's true that it does hurt their argument that they do quite a lot, but which are their good arguments, in your opinion?     I mean, take a State that really does nothing whatsoever. They have no benefits, no nothing, no nothing.     Okay?     And moreover, if -- if you're right, even in California, if they have -- if they're right or -- you know, if a pact is enough, they won't get Federal benefits.     Those that are tied to marriage because they're not married.     So -- so a State that does nothing hurts them much more, and yet your brief seems to say it's more likely to be justified under the Constitution. I'd like to know with some specificity how that could be.       I know the principle, but I'm saying which are their good arguments, in your opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the State that does nothing, but not good enough to overcome California where they do a lot?       Well, the real cost right now would be you're asking me to write these words, "a State that has a pact has to say 'marriage,'"     but I'm not telling you about States that don't.     Well, I would guess there is a real-world effect there, too.     That States that are considering pacts will all say, we won't do it, or not all, but some would. And that would have a real effect right now. And at the moment, I'm thinking it's much more harmful to the gay couple, the latter than the former.     But you won't give me advice as the government as to how to deal with that.
12-1493 +++$+++    That's awfully broad. It isn't the language, his point is I think that the statute, it has to be material to the lawfulness of the sale. Now, we look to see what section is it material to, and you say in your brief it's material to the section that says -- you have two of them, but they come to the same thing -- selling or delivering any firearm to any person. All right. Now, he says did they sell or deliver this firearm to what you call the real purchaser. No. They sold or delivered it to the straw, and that's the end of the matter. And at least the statute is open to this interpretation, and it's a criminal statute. And besides, the ATF for a long time interpreted it that way. So what we should do is interpret it strictly. Now, that's I think the basis of their argument if I understand it. And so you have to get those words "sale" and "deliver" and explain how in a criminal statute they apply to what you're calling the real purchaser.   But you also quote "material," the need for it to be material to the lawful ness of the sale.   You seem to concede that in the brief. It has to be material, and there are two sections and both come to the same thing, which is what I said.   If he was  if he then if he is the actual purchaser, then he falls within the term of a person to whom the firearm was sold or delivered. That's your argument.   Oh, there's no question about that.   Yeah, but still -- look, what I thought was a very good argument on your side is exactly what I said. The narrow interpretation would also apply to a straw man who buys a gun for Al Capone. And so this -- this part of the statute would be virtually worthless. Their response to that is don't worry about that. There are plenty of other provisions that will take care of that. Are there? And if it's so obvious about the Al Capone, why did the ATF decide it their way for 20 years? I mean, how -- how did they get into that?   But it's going to be the same problem, which is the straw because the transferee, in context, probably refers to the person to whom the dealer transferred the weapon; namely, the buyer. And does it apply, for example, if he knows that the buyer is going to give the -- the weapon to another person? And you will say no. Then he's not the transferee, the other person. You admit that. You say it. And so why is the person to whom -- the one who puts up the cash is going to later transfer the weapon is the same question as to whether he is really the purchaser. I just don't see a difference. And, therefore, I thought -- but you can explain to me why there's a difference. I'd like to know that. And I guess I'd like to bring you back to the -- to that issue and -- and I'd just like to know how the ATF reached the contrary conclusion if it would so undermine the statute.   Then what about the donee?
12-158 +++$+++       It is?    It is?    It is? That's the part that I can't yet get my mind to these dramatic questions of whether here the local police power or in some other case some other inherently State power make a treaty beyond the power of the Federal government to enter into.    It's a very big question. But I'm not there yet.    And the reason I'm not there is because there's some words in this treaty called "other peaceful purpose," and we have to interpret those words and the same words are in the statute. And my question to you is:    What reason is there to think that those matters on List A fall within those words?    What is List A?    It's infinitely long.    A few things on it are in Holmes' opinion in Peasley, a great case on attempted murder where he talks about paying a small boy to move a barrel of kerosene with a candle in it alit, so that it will burn down a barn after a few hours.    The kerosene is a chemical. He talks about a case where a person went to a racetrack and gave a horse a poison potato. He talks about a case involving somebody else trying to light a match, which is a chemical, and setting fire to a haystack. We can all think sadly of athletes, Lance Armstrong, at least accused of unlawfully taking drugs. I mean, why do we think matters of List A fall within those words, outside the words "other peaceful purpose," even though they're unlawful?    And by the way, did anyone say to the drafters of the convention -- I found nothing in this brief on the point -- or did anyone tell Congress that poison potatoes, drug-enhancing, performance-enhancing drugs, the example that Justice Alito used last time, you give vinegar to a goldfish -- I mean, these are all chemicals not in the annex, but they are chemicals.    And they are absolutely nothing to do with chemical weapons.    And why do we think that we have to get beyond that fact?      No, no.    There's an easy way out of that.    All we do is say the chemicals involved are the chemicals in the annex.    But you're not prepared to say that, I guarantee it.      Okay.    Now, we're outside the annex.    And I guess once we get outside the annex, we either have to draw lines or we have to say, well, this encompasses the poison potato, the poisoned goldfish, the small boy with the candle, the -- for performance-enhancing drugs.    I would say judges are here to draw lines, and between throwing all those things into it or drawing lines, it's better to draw a few lines.      No, no.    These are real cases, by the way.    The poison potato was in fact -      There's chocolate all over the place. (Laughter.)      No, I'm not -- I want your answer to the line -- my question was a question to get your answer.    And the answer that I wanted you to address yourself to is the problem of once you depart from the annexes in defining the chemicals, you throw into it a list a thousand miles long.    And we can tell joke after joke, but it's not a joke that it's so easy to make up examples that seem to have nothing to do with the problem of chemical weapons like the Syrian problem, nothing to do with that.      So what is your answer? That's what I want to know.      Why don't you tell us - can you tell us what the line is that we're trying to draw?      Well, look, also if you' telling me I am attempting to draw the line.    That's just what I was going to do.    And if you're saying it's against the national security interest, which is the first time I've heard that, that it is the national interests -- against the national interests of the United States for me to attempt to draw such a line, then I guess the State Department better file a brief explaining why or you ought -- or why you -- why you want to push this case or -- I mean, I'm -- is that what you're telling me, that if I write the opinion that I think the law requires me to write that I somehow am hurting the national security interests of the United States?      You're the one -      Oh, no.    That isn't the problem.      That is the question.      Oh, it is.    That is the problem.    There is an underlying -- I don't mean to cut you off, but at some point you seem not to see a problem that I think I see.    And the problem underlying it, if you get into the treaty area is this:    Given the power, as there is in Medellin's majority, to have some self-executing treaties, in principle your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution.    That's Missouri v. Holland.    And I doubt that in that document the Framers intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything. Now, you ask us now to say whether the answer to that question is yes or no. We still have a democracy, in other words, of which the House is part. Now, if you carry it to an extreme, that's what you are, that's where you are, and I am worried about that and I think others are, too. So I had asked you:    Isn't there an easier way to deal with this case?    And you tell me:    No, no, because we will interfere with some problem of foreign affairs that was never mentioned in any brief, or at least hit me for the first time when you said it. Now, there you have an expression of my uncertainties at the moment, and any way you want to reply to that would be helpful.
12-167 +++$+++        You want us to basically not apply the 11(h), the harmless error business, and you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making a tough definition of the word "participate."     That's how I understand you.     And maybe you are right, but it sounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that this is really a job for the rules committee. This is a rule.     We don't normally have structural errors with respect to rules.     We have rules committees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to weigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with better rules.
12-17 +++$+++        And so the question is, does it have to be better than that?    And -- and they are saying yes.    And, as I heard it, this -- what I would characterize as a strong argument -- this sort of, first of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is that, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State real estate people could always get information about property -- let's say they had a client who wanted to buy it. Now, you've protected that.    But, in today's world, it's important that we get statistics about this, too, because our economy is national.    If we understand how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to what extent they increase the value, to what extent they increase the rate, to what extent they really get the money they are supposed to, to what extent they might get money or not get money in the future. And all of those things are nationally important, so that people can put them together and make -- better than we have done in the past - predictions about what is likely to happen to States and, hence, the national economy.    All right. That's -- that's the kind of argument he's making.    And he says, so, therefore, there is a national interest in the flow of this information.    And that means you have to have a better than "uh-huh" kind of rationale.    That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.       Well, to be fair, I -- I was sort of expanding it.                     (Laughter.)      What is the standard, because you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities Clause is -- is considerably opaque, and there are very few cases on it.     And so what -- how would you tell me to -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a tension.
12-207 +++$+++        I would like a complete answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were asking, I think.     I mean, to summarize that, if I look, in terms of intrusion, I am not talking legally, I am talking practically.     It doesn't seem to me -- I can argue that it is certainly a much lesser intrusion than fingerprints.     You have to stand there, have the thing rolled; your -- stick out your tongue.     I mean, it's hard to say it's more, for me, I'm not saying for others. Accuracy, it's much more accurate, and that doesn't just help the defendant.     There is a whole brief here filed by the victims that have case after case, where people spent 5 years in prison, wrongly, and where this system and the CODIS helped victims avoid being arrested and sent to jail when they were innocent, so it works both ways. So, one, it's no more intrusive; two, it is much more accurate.     And three and four and five, how it's different and worse in practice, is what I would ask you to summarize.       And, by the way, when you talk about what information you could get out of it, there is a brief filed by leading scientists in the field, and I came away from the brief thinking there isn't much more information because fingerprints can be abused, too. Of course, you can learn loads from fingerprints.     Photos, try photos; my God, you could learn a lot, who he was, who recognized -- you know, so all these things could be abused.     But I came away from that brief, frankly, to think, well, in terms of the possibility of abuse, it's there, but these other things, photos, too.       -- I would like you -- I would like you to tell me, okay, it's different from fingerprints and worse because of one, two, three, and I will write it down, and I'll remember it.     I promise.       I think I can totally lose this because -- because I have a confusion that you can clear up.     There is something to what you say.     I see what you are saying.     But what does this word "identification" mean?     It's used for identification. We have a person, he's been arrested. He writes his name down, Mr. Smith.     Maybe he's lying.     We have his picture.     Well, his picture's pretty good.     If he turns up in a bar somewhere in the future, we can look, see, and that's awfully good. And, now, you say, well, what is fingerprinting doing that photos aren't doing, in terms of identification?     What does it do, in terms of just identification?       What does it do?       What does that mean, confirming his identity?     We have -- you mean what? What exactly?       Oh, really?     I mean, do you think the fingerprints -- where do you go to find out if he's Alonzo King?     A lot of people have never had their fingerprints taken before.       That's what it's for?     To determine what his name really is?       Ah.     You want to determine what his name really is, plus his adjudicated criminal history, and, here, we have the DNA, which I guess might or might not help determine what his name really is, and, with criminal history, it does about the same.     And also fingerprints are sometimes used to -- for unsolved crimes, and they are sometimes used for unsolved crimes, but your point really is more for unsolved crimes. Have I got it.
12-236 +++$+++ 
12-246 +++$+++        What is that?     That is what I'm -- I'm uncertain about this.     And they cite page , note 37, of Miranda. All right.     What is the law, in your opinion now, in respect to -- and what case would support this? A defendant comes in, he is warned and given his Miranda rights.     He says, fine, and then he proceeds to answer a whole bunch of questions. Then they ask question number 432.     He says nothing.     You then go on to 433, 434, et cetera, and he answers them all.     Okay?     At the trial, the lawyer - the prosecutor wants to comment on the fact that, in the face of that single question -- though answering many, many more -- he remained silent. Does Griffin say he can -- the prosecutor can make that comment, yes or no?     And I'd appreciate the government answering this question, too, because they're -- if they -- are they speaking here?     Or are you doing the whole argument?       Well, that's -- I'd like to get the same answer.       Because I -- well, now, they cite for the proposition, I think, that it -- that the prosecutor is forbidden to make that comment, note of Miranda.     Okay.     I just read it.       And I -- may be ambiguous on the point.     It says you have the right to maintain immunity in the face of an accusation.       No, fine.     But what's your opinion?     I mean, what is the law in respect to that single point?     And at least to me, I'd -- I'd like to know your opinion on that.       Is there any authority, or is it just your opinion that we have to go on?       Are you -- are you conceding the -- the point that they make?     I -- that - that even if in the custodial setting he waives his Miranda right, he answers 500 questions, but doesn't answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot comment on that fact that he didn't answer that one?       Does it?     What do you think?     He says, no, you can't, and he quotes Miranda. Okay?     What do you think?       And do you have a view on it?
12-25 +++$+++        Can they do this can Lawyer Smith say -- you know, there are some products in this State that I really suspect are not being properly made, and I have probably a tort suit; and the damages are awfully small; I would like to get or 20,000 plaintiffs.     I wonder if there is anybody interested? And then what he does is -- I have to write them a letter, and I know where I can get the names and addresses, from the DMV. So he goes to the DMV and says, I would like the names of everybody who -- I'd like all your names and addresses, and I intend to write them all and send them a letter and say, I suspect there is some fishy business going on here in the dress manufacturers; would you like to tell me about what happened?     Is that possible?     Can they do that?       Well, what do you --       Yes.       Well, maybe they -- maybe this is all passe.     Maybe -- perhaps they could get this information elsewhere, but I guess we have to deal with this statute --       So maybe what they want is they want the names of all the people who've ever had a car -- you know, because they think there's something special about a car, and they think that's going to be connected.     But you see what I'm driving at.       You have no lawsuit, but you are going to get one if you can, and you have grounds for thinking that there is some suspicious defendants, and what you are looking for is plaintiffs. That's all.       All you are looking for is plaintiffs.     Now, can you, under this statute, go and get the information, where all you are looking for is plaintiffs for your lawsuit?     So far, you know how many plaintiffs you have?     None.       All right.     Is your answer what I have in my mind -- I'm just repeating the same question.     I will do that -- I have some reason for thinking there are a whole bunch of defendants here who have done something wrong.     All I am lacking is a plaintiff, and what I want to do is get the names of potential plaintiffs.     It's the same question.     I have asked that three times.     Either you can, in your view, get it under this lawsuit, or you cannot.       No, no.     I'm not liking or disliking.     All I want to know is --       Wait, wait.     Now, that's your -- now, that's the line.     As to some of these defendants, what he's saying is, these lawyers had no client that my defendant hurt, none.       And as to some of these, but not all the requests, all they were doing was they were looking for somebody who bought a car from me.     And the reason they want that is to ask them what the practice was, so they can get a plaintiff to do what the complaint is about.     So it's at least two -- or one or two of the requests are like that.       Okay.     So, now, repeat to me -- I've got your point.       You have don't have to prove it to me.     All -- what I'm trying to get at is the statement that I could write in an opinion that will draw the boundary of this provision south of -- well, the lawyer can go out when he has reason to believe that a defendant has done something wrong and, to use a pejorative, troll for clients.       I want it south of that, and, now, you will tell me the words I can use that will both help your client because they will cover this case, but will also be south of that.     What are --       South means -- south means it does not -- you can't just go and troll for clients, simply because you think a defendant has done something wrong, and you have no client.       Okay.     So you are saying that really this is a -- the way the statute works is it says nobody can solicit, but for lawyers.     And that's not -- that makes more sense than you might think because this was not a statute that was meant to interfere with solicitation rules; it was meant to interfere with commercial selling. And -- and that's what this is about, and there is a requirement, the requirement as to the lawyer, in good faith, has to believe that, if he finds a client, there's a case.       All right.       The difficulty that Justice Alito brings out is -- I see your interpretation, and I hope the other side will give me some line because they have the same problem -- you know, but in reverse.     What is the line? But your way, it doesn't become that much of a privacy statute.     It's sort of a misnomer.     It's a -- it's a statute that is designed to prevent the commercial use of your -- of this personal information. It's not really a privacy statute.       Well, the reason -- the reason that would be so -- I agree with you, that it's very hard to figure out what the line is here between the investigation and solicitation. But that's where the solicitation thing comes into play because what it -- the words that go the other way, in my mind, that cut against you, is that this card could have asked for Social Security numbers, I guess.       Not under South Carolina law.     All right.     But then, under another State, under this statute, they could.     Now, that's helpful, that answer. But if -- when I think of asking for Social Security numbers, I -- the words -- exaggerated, but they go through my mind -- are "identity theft run wild."       And, if that is a concern -- if that is a concern, then, by reading this as a solicitation -- you know, the pure case -- and throwing the other exception to cover it, you force the State to focus on it. And the State then has to decide whether they are going to permit or not permit the solicitor, who -- you see, might -- might include the lawyer here, to ask for the Social Security number, and better to have them focus on that decision.     That's the connection that I see between the two.       Okay.     So are we -- do we know -- by the way, that is helpful because do we know under how many States' law the DMV would be forbidden to give Social Security numbers?
12-3 +++$+++       When you're ready to go through this, I'd appreciate your telling in your opinion -- what the statute says, taking the extraneous words out, is that no contractor of a publicly-traded company may discharge, demote, et cetera, any employee because of his lawful act in reporting a fraud.    That's what it says. So, what did they have in mind if they didn't have in mind forbidding any contractor of a publicly-traded company from a contractor -- and, you know, maybe there are limitations there -- but a contractor from demoting an employee because of his lawful act reporting a fraud?      Or any -- I just eliminated the extraneous words and instead of the not the word "such," I put in what "such" refers.      All right.    So all they're interested in here, you say, is this workout contractor, but not for example where you have a fund which has virtually no employees and does all its work really through investment advisors such as here, and you think Congress didn't want to include the investment advisor firing its whistleblower even if it's directly related to the fraud, hot fund and everything else, but it did just want to include the people who -- who are there because the contractor is a workout firm, and -- and not the investment advisor.      Now, all that's a conceivable reading, I agree.      But what is it that leads you to that conclusion other than -      You're right on that.    I mean, it is correct that that's what they talk about. And so that sends us on a search for limitation.    You have one limitation.    Your limitation says the person who is dismissed has to be an employee of the publicly-traded company. Now, the government, and -- and even your - Mr. Schnapper has come up with accepting some limitations.    There are possibly others.    One would be on the nature of the contractor, which you want to do, but it would be somewhat broader than yours.    Another, possibly, is on the nature of the fraud.    Is it related to the contract?    Another might be the one the district court proposed, and there could be others. So I think if you want to say anything about this, it seems to me that taking as given -- I will for argument's sake anyway -- say all the legislative history is about publicly-traded companies.    And I do look at it.    But nonetheless, they did use this language in their other possible limitations that would serve the same purpose. Then you say to that, saying yours is the best, what?      Oh, that itself is a big limitation.    Huge.      They didn't say that today. And -- and if, in fact, the fraud is related to the contract or by certain kinds of contractors who do investment work, who do all kinds of important work for the company, why shouldn't it be covered?    I mean, and the language, of course, does say what I read, as you agreed.    It says a contractor.      So it may be that you have a good point, that it's the SEC we should defer to and not the Labor Department.    But then, as was pointed out, fine, then you're going to have that rulemaking and given their position here, it looks as if they will hold something you don't like.    But -- so what are we supposed to do about that, in your opinion?      Why is it -- we may have to get to this.    I thought Section 3(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley -- that's what we found here.    Quote, "The Securities and Exchange Commission shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary and appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and in furtherance of this Act." So why doesn't that delegate right to the SEC the power to interpret the general provisions of the Section 802?      Well, so I mean, I don't know that we should interpret that provision since no one has briefed, given -- on that basis.      Where did it come from? That is, where did the words "contractor"?    Some human being wrote them for the first time.    You probably know who did and where and under what circumstances.    What? What, you know?      Some of us are interested in that.    At least I am.      I know.    So who is the human being who wrote them and what did he have in mind, or she? (Laughter.)      Let's go back to the hearings.    I mean, there might have been hearings.
12-307 +++$+++        Then yet --       Or if there's no interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday. It seems to me, forgetting your -- your preferable argument, it's a violation of equal protection everywhere.     Well, if it is, then all States have to have something like pacts.     And if they have to have something like pacts, then you say then they also have to allow marriage. So then are you not arguing they all have to allow marriage?     And then you say no.     All right, so with that point --       What -- what do you think of his -- the argument that I heard was, to put the other side, at least one part of it as I understand it said, look, the Federal government needs a uniform rule. There has been this uniform one man, one woman rule for several hundred years or whatever, and there's a revolution going on in the States.     We either adopt the resolution -- the revolution or push it along a little, or we stay out of it.     And I think Mr. Clement was saying, well, we've decided to stay out of it.       And the way to stay out of it is to go with the traditional thing.     I mean, that -- that's an argument.     So your answer to that argument is what?       I understand you do, I'd like to know the reason. (Laughter.)
12-315 +++$+++    But we have granted cert on this guestion. So -- so given that fact, could we do this: One, yes, it has to be false; two, the Colorado supreme court, because of footnotes 5, as well as 6, which I haven't picked up, and other things they've said, is at least ambiguous about the role the jury's finding played. And given that fact, what we'll do is we'll go through and see where the parties agree about what happened in -- in the world, and insofar as they agree, we'll take it, you see. Your side will get the underlying assumption, and looking at it, as it's agreed upon, we find either that it would be or wouldn't be within the scope of the immunity. And on that one, you might lose. But is there -- is there -- what do you think of that procedure?   No, it doesn't say that. It says -- footnote 6 has to be read with footnote 5, which I hadn't picked up. And once I put those two footnotes together, I have no idea what the Colorado supreme court says.   All of us have had the experience -- at least I have, of -- if I get very angry at something, one of my children will say, God, he's mentally unstable. See, I mean, that's -- people use that word in different contexts. And what's worrying me is -- is that some real threat comes along and the lawyers get involved and the people are going to report it to the TSA, start watching their words and they don't know what the lawyers mean exactly -- and you understand the problem.   So why isn't the best thing to say is, look, there is leeway here -- considerable leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's reporting -- that are reporting things to TSA. All it means is they are going to search him more thoroughly.
12-357 +++$+++        The obvious problem, which you might want to address at some point, is that -- that if you take your definition that this recommendation, legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said, you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if that's property, we're back to the honest services statute because anyone in government and anyone in business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs always require you to do things. So if every time somebody threatens a person and says, we don't want you to do the thing you're supposed to do, we want you to do the thing like this, well, then you're violating this property statute.       Now, that seems very far reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case - the abortion clinic case, et cetera, and it is easy to reconcile with the honest services case.       Well, I mean, that sounds technical.     You see, the problem I'm interested in is, by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is an appropriate threat which has as a condition the person doing the job differently?     That's true of whether it's a postman, you know, any public official, any private official, anybody.       That seems very far-reaching.     So -       Yes, I understand that. But I still would like an answer to my question, and it's well-phrased with an example by Justice Kennedy. Every secretary in the United States who is about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to college or some other thing then is faced with a threat, you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of no, and is under your definition that person's property, that what she does the taking of property?     The answer is either you think yes, in which case I would like you to defend it -       Or the -- yes.     Okay.     Then what conceivable ground?     I'm not -- I don't want to - that sounds a little pejorative, but I'll say, what ground is there for a definition that is so broad that it sweeps within it all working people in the United States in the performance of their ordinary jobs?       As I think about it in terms of the New York cases, as you write them up here, it sounds as if someone was trying to get control of a business.     So I think business, land, labor, and capital.     All right.     I can see why somebody who's trying to get control of a whole business is trying to take land, labor, and capital.     There may be no land there, but so what.     And -- but a person's trying to take control of another's job by just telling him what to do 2 percent of the time seems well across some kind of line.       No, no.     No attaining question.     I'm just thinking is it reasonable to call a secretary doing one job which takes 3 percent of her time that hour property, in a way is that different from taking control of Macy's?       And -- and it seems to me that probably it is.       No, no, I'm not worried about copyrights or other intangibles.       That's not the issue.       Why -- why, just as long as we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C. 875, "Whoever with intent to extort from any person," you know, "anything of value"?       You don't have -- you don't have property in there.     You have a thing of value -       -- is there some -- I mean, it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger position when you say that the recommendation not to buy or to buy a particular service from somebody is a thing of value.       Have they in the Court been treated as a thing of value means property?       So no.
12-398 +++$+++        Well, that's true, but then you were saying something that I just didn't understand because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and it's attached to two ends. But also in the body, perhaps because cells die, there is isolated DNA.     And that means that the DNA strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies, and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very few of them in the world, but there are some, by the laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely the BRCA1 gene. Now, have I misread what the scientists told us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?       I probably misread it. There's a better chance that I've misread it. (Laughter.)       Well, which one have I not read -       So in other words, you're saying that the Lander brief is wrong.       I want to know because I have to admit that I read it and I did assume that as a matter of science it was correct.     So I would like to know whether you agree, as a matter of science, that it is correct, not of law, but of science, or if you are disagreeing with it, as a matter of science.       I'd like a yes or no answer.       Was the answer no, you do not disagree with it?     I wonder, I disagree or I do disagree?       As a matter of science.       Okay.     Very well.     If you are saying it is wrong, as a matter of science, since neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell me that it's wrong.       No, I need to know -       All right.     So when you are on that, that's good.     A more basic question to me is when you use the word "dangerous."     I had thought -- and you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on the one hand, we do want people to invent.     On the other hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance. And so that the compromise that has been built historically into this area is, of course, if you get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the plant in the Amazon, patented.     Of course, if you get the sap out and you find that you can use it, you manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented.     But what you can't patent is the sap itself. Now, in any individual case that might be unfortunate or fortunate.     But consider it in the mine run of things.     It's important to keep products of nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers them, although that expedition was expensive, although nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the thing itself.     He gets a patent on the process, on the use of the thing, but not the thing itself. Now, that's my understanding of what I'd call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably understand better than I.       And I would like you to express your view on that because that's the framework that I am bringing to the case.       You are saying it gets past .       Well, that's -- that's the problem.     I mean, all parts of the human body?     Anything from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?       And it gets through 101? Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's bothering me.       Ah.     Then -- then watch what you're doing.     That's very, very interesting. Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've rejected more often than we've followed it. And particularly with a thing found in nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just - human kidneys and so forth.     Everything is inside something else.     Plants, rocks, whatever you want.     And so everything will involve your vast taking something out of some other thing where it is, if only the environment.     And it's at that point that I look for some other test than just that it was found within some other thing.
12-399 +++$+++        Actually, it does -- does (f) apply, in your opinion, to this case or not?       And (f) has something of the best interest standard tilted towards the Indian parent.       Is that right or not?     I mean, as I read it it's something.     It's tough, but it's there.       So in your view the best interest standard does not apply, but rather (f) applies?       And (f) is a tough version of the best interest standard. Have I got it right or not?       You should if I'm not right. (Laughter.)       But that is a problem. Because, look, I mean, as it appears in this case is he had three Cherokee ancestors at the time of George Washington's father.     All right?     Now, you say, oh, well, that's a different issue. But I don't see how to decide that case without thinking about this issue because if your view is taken and you accept that definition, a - a woman who is a rape victim who has never seen the father could, would, in fact, be at risk under this statute that the child would be taken and given to the father who has never seen it and probably just got out of prison, all right?     And you don't know that this beyond reasonable doubt standard would satisfy that. Now, that's obviously something I find disturbing, as a person and also as a judge, because we're trying to interpret the statute to avoid results that would be very far out, at least.     And -- and that's what I want you to tell me.     How do I prevent that kind of risk through an interpretation of the statute?       But doesn't it happen, in your interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an interpretation I can understand, that -- remember my hypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic.     We can think of a whole range of things short of that where the father has seen the mother never, perhaps, or sperm donors for very short periods of time, and under your interpretation where there is an ongoing relationship, even a short one, at least they can't give the child to the father where it would be very harmful to the -- to the child. But under your interpretation, the one category of people who is exempt from that are the category of fathers who've never seen the mother. Who've seen the mother a very short time.     Who may be in -- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's very harmful to the child. So I just -- am I right about your interpretation having that effect?     And if it does have that effect, what's the justification for it?       All right.     So you can say, oh, there's no such thing as a parent, a father who only sees the mother -       All right.     Okay.     All right. Now, let's suppose there is such a thing. As long as there is such a thing, the anomaly that I mention seems to me to exist.     And am I wrong or right about that?     And if it exists, what's the basis for your creating an interpretation of the statute that would produce it?
12-414 +++$+++        So the point is that there has to be some evidence.     You -- you are saying that the court was wrong when they said your client said she wasn't guilty. Now, this affidavit doesn't show that.     I mean, paragraph 6 doesn't say who spoke first, but common sense suggests that the deputy sheriff wouldn't have made that statement, unless she spoke first.     I mean, does he go around saying to everybody, just generally, oh -- you know, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. I mean, it says they had discussions, and during discussions, he told her she shouldn't plead guilty if she wasn't guilty.       Where?       Where -- approached her -       -- and had discussions with her.     It doesn't say why he approached her.     I mean, I just don't think people normally do that, they go to every person in jail and say, you know, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. I mean, somebody might, but something triggered that advice, and the affidavit doesn't tell me what triggered that advice.     So I could infer that what triggered the advice was her statement she was not guilty, or I could infer this is an unusual situation where, for some reason unknown, he brought it up.     I don't know, from reading paragraph 6.       So whose burden is it?       Okay.       It doesn't matter.     Why doesn't it matter?     Because if she went, he -- she said -- you know, I'm not really guilty, he said, well, you shouldn't plead guilty, she said -- but I have a lawyer that will get rid of your guilty plea.     If it went something like that, and then we assume the lawyer was told about this -- it doesn't say, but that's a reasonable assumption. And then the court opinion of Michigan seems to make sense that that was a reason -- that was one of the reasons that made his conduct in -- in withdrawing the plea or -- you know, not strongly advising her against it.     That was one reason why that wasn't an inadequate assistance of counsel. Now, where have I made my mistake in this chain?       I thought you were -- there is a reason that they spoke about, which was, well, she said she was innocent.     Now, as to that one, what they wrote is the record discloses that the second attorney's advice was set in motion by defendant's statement to the sheriff's deputy that he did not commit the offense. Now, you say that's just contrary to fact as you point to the affidavit.     And the affidavit I read, I think it's a little -- rather ambiguous in that respect, and I can overturn that, or a Federal court can, only if this factual statement I just read you is clearly wrong, clearly.     So I have a tough time saying it's clearly. And I know they overstated because they said automatically, in this case -- well, that may be an overstatement.     You have to read it in light of that sentence.     But then you're making a second argument, I take it, if this is right.     Your second argument is, anyway, he was incompetent for a completely different reason. He didn't read the record.     And if he'd read it, he never would have made the statement that this is just a manslaughter case.     He would have seen that, if she withdrew her guilty plea, she'd be tried for murder, and then she'd get a really long sentence. So that's an ineffective assistance of counsel.     Now, what does the Court in Michigan say about that?     Nothing.     Nothing.     So now, I wonder.     Maybe nobody made that argument to them, or maybe they made it, and they rejected it sub silentio.     That's why I asked my first question.     Okay?     So -- and you heard the response. Even if they had heard that argument and they said nothing about it, they don't have to -- they don't have to mention every argument made.     If they just deny, we assume they deny it, and what we do is see whether they were within their rights to deny it. That's how we are supposed to look at it, does it clearly violate Supreme Court law to deny it? And there is going to be a factual part of that and a legal part.     All right.     How do we deal with that?       First of all, did anybody make the argument as clearly as you have made it?     I saw what it was, I think.     So that's -- did anybody make that argument to the Michigan court?       No.     Okay.     Well, that's the end of that, isn't it?     What you are coming for is you have to proceed by asking for reopening in the Michigan court and see if they say it's too late.     And then -- you know, et cetera, they're all spelled out in this opinion, which I can't remember, Cullen or Pinholster or something, and this isn't an argument for us now.
12-416 +++$+++        Yes.     But there, it's not -- their point is not it's per se unlawful.     What they want is they want to cut some kind of line between a per se rule and the kitchen sink.     And if you look at the brief supporting you, it is the kitchen sink.     You have economists attacking the patent system or praising it, da, da, da, and here and there and the other.     They don't want the kitchen sink. Now, suppose I don't want the kitchen sink, but I have a hard time saying what the per se rule is. So what's your idea?       Okay.     Suppose --       Okay.     Suppose -- this sounds like an argument, a discussion that youd have in the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction to this.     Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit.     In deciding whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may take that into account.     Two, do not take into account the strength of a patent.     Three, do not try to relitigate the patent. Four, there are several possible justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs, litigation costs -- the other products, different assessments of -- of value.     Five, there could be, in fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, but there could be.     We don't know.     Okay? So start with where we were.     Could be anticompetitive.     Give the defense a chance to go through five, one through five, and if they convince you there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the sixth, too.     Okay?     Now, judge, weigh and decide. That's what we do.     So we've structured it somewhat to keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs given to us.     What's wrong with that?       So why does it help you to say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but you can't pay them money.     That that will help to stop strike suits if it costs them nothing to get in.     They have to really want to enter or they won't bring lawsuits.     So why does that hurt you?
12-417 +++$+++       Yes, what I think he's saying is this, that my puzzle was, why was this a big deal for the unions?    All they have to do is keep their mouths shut and the employer is going to have to go to them and say, we want this in the agreement. But he says:    You haven't read those words "custom or practice," and if you see the words "custom or practice" you'll see that an awful lot of businesses or firms or manufacturing across the country actually has long had a custom or practice where they didn't pay for that or they didn't exclude it, or they didn't -- so in those circumstances, it's the union that's going to have to go to the employer and say:    Please put some other words in the agreement so we get this out of the statute.    And now I have no idea -- I think that's what his point was. And of course this is an empirical question in part of, that kind of point, which is logically sound, affects a certain number of workers in industries.    And I would next be curious either you or the SG or anyone has some estimate of what we are talking about quantitatively.      Why would it be difficult? Why not just say clothes, at least from your point of view, clothes are -- are those items that have, as a significant purpose, the covering of one's body.    That's not the purpose of eyeglasses; it's not the purpose of wristwatches; it's not the purpose of -- of cameras held around your neck; it's not the purpose even of an iPod.      Well, is there anything wrong with what I just said?      What?      Opening your locker is not clothes. (Laughter.)      Well, that's not -- but still, we're back to the statute which says "clothes."      And therefore, what's wrong with the definition I just proposed?      Well, that's -- that's up to them how they negotiate.    But -- but the statute says "clothes," so we would have to pay for the clothes time. They'd have to pay for the clothes time unless it's in the collective bargaining agreement or -- you know, if it's in the collective bargaining -- unless it's in the collective bargaining agreement.      Or custom and -      No.    Why -- why does it include eyeglasses?    Eyeglasses do not have as a principal -- as a significant purpose the covering of one's body.      So maybe we can call them constructive clothes, which means they're not clothes. (Laughter.)      Do you have any estimate on the empirical -- there are only two people that know, the Department of Labor and the AFL-CIO, and they didn't tell us, the latter.    So -- so what we're thinking of, I think, is workplace hazard clothing.    Okay?    And the problem, I think, that was raised is that the union can't stop -- can't -- can't -- can't make an agreement about this without a lot of trouble anyway.    They can't just shut up, in other words, and see that the - there'll be compensation because there's a custom or practice in the industry of giving -- of not giving them compensation.      Do you follow?    Do you follow --      Yes, yes.    But they've had -      -- collective bargaining agreements in steel forever.    All right?    So if we go back to -- to 1949 or 1952 and they entered into some big deal agreement, I mean, what was the custom or practice at that time?    I don't know.    I suspect you don't know.    And I -- I wonder if the Department of Labor knows.      I wonder if anyone knows.      All right.    So there is -      Exactly.
12-418 +++$+++        Okay.     Then why not this?       Well -- why not?     I mean, look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, "If you can think of a thing that is inextricably related to another thing without thinking of the other thing, then you have the legal mind," and that seems to be this case.     All right?       So somehow I have to get out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential violation of due process part, the equal protection part, take that aside.     Now I've got to just think about whether it has, Congress has the power under the provision that Justice Alito said.     I'm trying to do Page 31 that, and I've dissented in other cases on other grounds. All right.     But in -- in just trying to do that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have unfortunate problems in the military.     They discover there is a mental illness problem.     The person's out of the military.     But the law says you can go and tell the local mental health authorities about this person even though he's no longer there. And suppose the person had a criminal problem in the military and was in prison and suppose the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the situation where he unfortunately got into that problem, and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities about his problems so they can take appropriate action. Now, if they can do that, why can't they have the power under Article I to say really, you all have to register.     Now, maybe there are other things, but you got this problem in the military.     You were convicted in the military.     You did it in the military. We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as part of our military regulation, to be able to tell authorities about you and to make you register according to State law. Page 32 Now, no due process problem, I have to assume that away.     No punishment, bad punishment problem, none of those.     But it's a power, all right? Why not?       Where you're leading me because I'm not so worried about this case, but where you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and all kinds of other cases.     Suddenly a distinction arises that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things having Federal authorities do this and that, but you couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so what I'm worried about is following this distinction into other areas.       But yet, now that's exactly the problem for me because the -- the wilds of Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -- that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a post office there, then what -- the military is all right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem. That seems to be okay. But you say it's not going to be okay to tell him he has to go and make that registration.     At that point what you've done is like Madison.     I mean, it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading a lack of power because of a civil rights problem. I mean, it's -- the difference between the two cases is really not the need because we have to assume the need.     The difference is the restriction on the individual.     And it's that part that I'm suddenly worried about the Commerce Clause and every power in Article I being read with exceptions in the civil rights Page 36 area even though we have the amendments to protect the civil rights problems.       No, but it's the military -- look, it's the military that they are mostly -- that they're relying on.       So they say -- I mean, the famous statement -- I looked it up -- "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and Proper Clause." All right?     The end is to protect the communities from those individuals in respect to those matters that they became dangerous with when they were in the military, okay?     That's the end. And is the means appropriate?     They say yes. They say, after all, the means here is, notify them when we're -- you're moving around.     And therefore, is it forbidden? Well, we're not supposed to consider that Page 46 part, but -- so leave that out.     But the -- the others, they say is okay.     So that's the basic. Do you think maybe we should send this back to the -- to the Fifth Circuit?     The government suggests that --   -- because they didn't get it right in respect to what the previous statutes require. What about all that?       I just want to know what to do if I end up thinking they are right.       What's your recommendation there on that assumption?     I'm not saying I would, but I'm just saying on that assumption.
12-43 +++$+++        If they know what it really was, I guess they're all billionaires.    You've got triple billionaires.    I mean, if you could go and figure out what companies could really be sold at, as opposed to what the market says, I think I have the solution for you.     I don't know why either of us is working here. (Laughter.)       So, since there is no real value, I -- I mean, maybe there is because they did it in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next day into the market, and, when it went the next day into the market, did the market pay a lot more?       Really?       All right.     Then you could use that.     You could use that, I guess.       But, how does that relate to the number 9?       Yes, yes.     But, of course, in the -- in the past, we are making a prediction about what efficiencies will be realized, and, in the future, we know.     So the one thing we don't know, since life is risky -- or we do know for sure -- is whatever it shows up to be in the future couldn't have been the value that shareholders would put on it in the past because they know life a risky.       So the reason that that is relevant here, of course, is this number 9 is a made-up number.     It may be made up by great experts, but since they are all not geniuses who are -- own the whole world, they must not be perfect experts.       Isn't that true?       No, it was a number picked by whatever company had -- what is it, the -- the lowest price earnings ratio or something like that.       Okay.     But that doesn't -- that means whatever company that the shareholders thought would deviate the least from whatever the return was and that doesn't apply the others.     But you don't want a lecture from me on this subject. What I want is an answer from you, and the answer I want from you is this:     As I read it and once understand that this number is a semi made-up number, I did look at that second term, and I thought that .23 times 9 is about 2 years' worth -- about 2 years' worth of profits that would be expected, all things left out of it, except profit. And so then, once I saw that, I looked at the first term.     And the first term seemed, to me, to be their actual profit -- their actual profit on an annual basis multiplied by about the same number, you see? And so what we do is we take -- about multiplying, you see -- so we take about two years' worth of profit that they actually made, and we subtract from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they should have made as -- on the basis of the original market price.     The rest is excess profit, and we seize all of it, for two years only. And, by the way, if a company had only six months' worth, well, then -- you know, they might really be hurt because, after all, they only earned six months at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they didn't really earn it over the next 18 months.     But the reply was there was no such company.     And, of course, because time periods vary, rates will vary. But I don't know that that matters for an income tax.     It's not a question of the rate; it's a question on what you impose it.     And you impose it on income because, as he says, there are two choices here. Number is really calculated on the basis of income, and there is another number going on, the actual floatation value, and this third thing, which is called the number .     But, primarily, it is the income that makes the difference. Now, that's his argument.     What's your response?     That's his argument, as I understand it. I don't want to put words in his mouth.     But you -- you explain it to me.       But I said, so what?     Now, you can answer that by saying, no, it's not so what. I mean, isn't an income tax dependant upon whether it's a tax on income, not the rate?     And -- and whether some companies pay a high rate and others pay a low rate, even if that's totally arbitrary, wouldn't make a definition to the characterization.       As long as you're not -- they actually have the gross income from which this comes.       No, it will.     Wait, wait, wait, wait.     It is greater than the profit they earned during the year, but it is not greater than the profit that they earned during the two years -- or whatever the period is that everybody's paying this on.       Is that right?       So, here, by good luck for them or bad luck for you or whatever it is, they have not taxed more than the gross income of the companies. Is that -- is that --       Four-year period.     Well, that's -- well -- well, is it not going to be an income tax if what the U.S. government says, though it hasn't said it, it could say, we want -- we want 35 percent of what you earn over six years.     Okay.     That's what we want.     Now, that's still an income tax, isn't it?       So you say whatever -- if they impose it on more than a year, any -- any country that calculates the income tax over a period for more than a year is outside the tax treaty because it's essential to the nature of the American income tax system that it be calculated year by year. You're hesitating to say that, but I think -       On that -- on the question of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority, but, I mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I think the people in the tax court actually, usually, know more about it than the judges who are not on the tax court. And so when I get an opinion and the tax court all thinks one thing and then the court of appeals is thinking something else and it's highly technical, I -- I tend to be tempted to say, well, the tax courts deserve something. Now, is there anything, really?     Am I just doing that wrong, if I did that?       If the reformulation -- think of -- think that first term.     Put it in your mind. Now, that first term does have a number -- .23 -- and let's do times 9, which is that valuation business.     And what you get is a little over 2.     Okay? And you are going to get that every time. That's not going to vary from company-to-company.     That varies as long as the universe is here.     So we know we're going to multiply .2 -- rather, 2 point something times that first part of the first term. And that first part of the first term consists of nothing other than, for the four-year company, the average one-year profit.     So the only -- what you are telling people to do in that first term is simply multiply by a little over than 2 -- a little more than 2 -- the average profit earned over a four-year period.     That's what it says. So there is nothing there but income.     It's average income, I grant you.     But there is nothing there but income.     And then what you subtract from that -- what you subtract from that is a quarter -- is a quarter of the value, I grant you.     But it's a hypothetical value used with the number 9 of what one-quarter of the value of the floatation price taken in. So there's an aspect to it that does have -- unless you do it the way I was doing it initially -- there is an aspect to it that does concern at least a hypothetical value.     But the heart of the equation, in determining this so-called present value, is nothing other than taking average income over the four-year period. Now, if I'm right -- am I right about that?       Okay.       No, no.     It is -- the very first part of the first part is the profits -- the average profit over the four-year period.     It says P. And then P, with all of this day business, that's just times 365 because they want to annualize it. So, if you have a four years, what you are going to have is you -- you will have 365 times -- and then it's going to wipe out, and you will have divided by 4.     So you will take the total profit over the four-year period, and you'll divide it by 4.     That gives you the annual profit.     So, now, we have finished the first half of the first part. And the second half -- and we are going to take .23 of that.     Okay? No, we are not going to take any yet. Taking .23 -- you're going to take .23 of the number 9, and that leaves you with the 2 -- that brings you to the little over 2.2.       So what we are doing is taking the average annual profit over a four-year period, we average it, and then we multiply it by two point something.     Okay?     And what that is doing -- and then what that is doing is giving you just the average annual, two years' worth of average annual. And, from that, we subtract a quarter of what they received in the initial price, which happens to be what the market -- if it really was 9 -- about was expecting it to earn during a two-year period.     That's why I put in the last part. But even if I am wrong about that, I am right about the first half, aren't I.       That's why I said percent.       Yes, yes, yes.     That rate could be a problem for somebody at some time, in some place.      It wasn't a problem here because all of these companies, but one, did have and did fit within the four-year category.     So as to all these companies, but one, it did not exceed gross income; it did not exceed net income; it was 50 -- what the number that he arrived at.      It is?       Of the one year, you haven't calculated based on one year, but it's 50 percent of two years, isn't it? I'm sorry.    I am now confused enough that I am not following you.      All right.       All right.     I have said enough -- my law clerks will have picked this up.     They will have written it down, and I will be able to go back with the transcript and study it, which I will do. (Laughter.)       Why -- why should it be changed?     I mean, why should companies -- American companies doing business abroad, in borderline cases, have to pay tax on the same income twice?
12-462 +++$+++    Well, you would -- you would agree -- it's the same guestion I asked the government. I would like your answer. I imagine that you would agree that a State says the following: We read into -- like common law courts used to do all the time, for a transportation company, we believe the price must be fair and reasonable, and a contract in our State, for transportation prices, has to set a fair and reasonable price, and I personally think many fares are not reasonable. They are too high. All right. And, therefore, we have substituted the judges and the States for setting prices instead of the parties. All right. You agree that would be preempted?   All right. Now, so what is your standard for distinguishing what is and is not preempted where the State uses its contract law to imply a fair and reasonable term?   That isn't what your -- your complaint that I think -- paragraph 56, which I think is the key paragraph says, that the -- under the -- the law is -- the contract law that you want to enforce is, even where a party to a contract is given absolute discretion, it must exercise that discretion in good faith in a manner consistent with the reasonable expectations of the other party or parties. Now, that's, I think, what they're objecting to because, there, it sounds to me like I go in to -- you know, get a ticket, my reasonable expectation is they're not going to charge me what they're going to charge -- you know, I mean, it's unbelievable. But there -- but, you see, that's my reasonable expectation, and I'm the other party. And so that clause sounds as if you could, under State contract law, govern the price according to my reasonable expectation, namely, the consumer, that might be a great idea, but I don't think that's the idea behind this act. That's what -- what -- that's what I just read you. So what do you say about that?   I didn't see anything in the complaint about anything other than airlines.   Is there anything in your complaint that talks about anything other than airlines?   No, I know. But, I mean, what we are taking about is what Count 2 of the complaint says. I think that's their objection. But, as far as Count 2 of the complaint says, it's about airline miles, I take it, and airline miles are used on airlines and -- et cetera.   Well, if there is something else in this complaint, tell me, and I will have to figure out whether we go beyond the complaint.   Does it say that in the complaint?   And an airline partner, I take it, is another airline?   So if I want to find out about that in the record, where do I look?   All there is, is the complaint, and it doesn't talk about it in the complaint. What I'm thinking about, obviously, is we might reserve that guestion for another day.
12-464 +++$+++        They do that, fine, done. What we interpret the statute as saying, under constitutional compulsion, it uses the word "may," and if the magistrate concludes that there is -- after all, the basic principle of hearings is you don't need a hearing where there's nothing to have a hearing about. So unless the defendant demonstrates that there is a sound reason to believe that the grand jury was wrong, they only heard one side of the story, and that there is no probable cause, you don't have to give him a hearing. But the word is "may."     And so, like five circuits, Mr. Magistrate, if you think that there is a good chance -- phrase that as you want -- that they can show that the grand jury was wrong and they want the money to pay a lawyer -- by the way, without a good lawyer, they're never going to make their case --     and then, under those circumstances, the magistrate may. Now, that's a narrow exception.     It preserves the lawyer.     It's consistent with the words of the statute.     It respects the grand jury, at least to the same extent that bail hearings -- and when you have -- oh, yes, and probably, I could think of a few others or something.     But the -- it's not undercutting the grand jury. What's wrong with it?       No, it leaves open -- it leaves open the question in Monsanto explicitly, and the only change that I've made with that explicit leaving open the due process question in the footnote in Monsanto is, instead of turning it on the Constitution, I turned it on the principle of constitutional avoidance.       You say "never" is consistently, and I think it is consistent with the footnote.       It didn't actually.     What it says is, we reject the discretion in the context of Judge Widener having said that, even where there is probable cause, we are going to balance a lot of factors, and what it says at the -- wait, I had it a second ago.     I'll find it again. It says, at the top of the next page, it says that the "may" thing refers to that.     I'll get it for you later.       Here it is.     It says, "Thus, it's plainly aimed at implementing the commands at 853(a) and cannot sensibly be construed to give the district court discretion to permit the dissipation of the very property that 853(a) requires to be forfeited upon conviction."     Okay?       Exactly.     That's what it says.     So the claim here is this is property that 850(a)(3)(A) does not require the defendant to forfeit upon conviction, for there can be no conviction because there is no evidence, and, therefore, I don't find that that sentence in Monsanto destroys the use of the word which Congress put in, "may."       Okay.     So far, this is very conceptual, which is absolutely fine.     I just want to leave that plain for a moment, and if I leave the conceptual plain, what I find is that they have a pretty complicated case. They are saying that this -- the defendant took some medical devices with permission from hospitals that were old and used, and he didn't return them to the manufacturer, who didn't want them.     And what he did is he figured out this way of selling them and making money. Now, they are saying that's not that, and you're saying it is that, and so to make the arguments is complicated.     You can't do it without a good lawyer. He has some money here to hire a lawyer, and you say, oh, but it will undercut the grand jury.     You say, this has been the law in five circuits, and the government has not come to the end of its prosecutions, it hasn't injured prosecutions. So as a purely practical matter, First Amendment, no real harm to the government that I can see.     And so let's impose some kind of statutory limitation on use of this, but where there is a good claim for it, let it be used.       Has that happened in the circuits that have permitted this?       You know, I think, in the circuit, you've now given us some statistics.     So in how many cases in the circuits that have permitted what they want or my version of it, the circuits that have permitted some form of allowing the magistrate to look behind the grand jury indictment in appropriate cases and find that it's there, there is no probable cause, so you can use this to hire a lawyer. There are a bunch of circuits that have had rules like that.     In how many cases in those circuits has the government faced the serious risks that you're talking about?       Can you give me a guess? You are -- I mean, you make a huge point of how this will put the government at a disadvantage, so someone in your office, probably you, asked people in the Justice Department, do you have any examples?     Or how many cases have there been where these serious problems arose? And you probably got some kind of answer, so you probably have some kind of idea.       How many anecdotes? (Laughter.)       In a number of cases, several specific.     Is that more like four?     Or is it more like 24?       Can I ask you a related question, since it came up?     I was curious as to how much of this forfeiture money gets to victims.     So the best we could do is looking up three years, and on the basis of the figures that I got out of the DOJ on that, about 25 -- 20 to 25 percent goes to a category called third-party interest. Now, the third-party interest includes mortgagees, it includes other creditors, it includes States, who want taxes, et cetera.     And if you subtract all those, a rough guess would be 5 or 10 percent goes to victims.     Now, do you have a better estimate?       That is what the -- if you look at the actual amount in general, but the interests at issue here are, one, this money goes to pay for a lawyer, so the person can prove that there is not even a claim against him; and the risks, of course, sometimes of depriving the recipients of the forfeiture monies, and those would normally be, almost entirely, the DOJ for the expenses of going to the forfeiture expense of the trial. It would -- various criminal justice organizations on the prosecution side, States, who want taxes, very little is being deprived of victims.     Is that a fair comment?       We could deal with that, couldn't we, by imposing conditions surrounding the use of the word "may" with conditions that would reject - you would say they rejected it.     The magistrate thought this was just a fishing expedition for evidence.     That's not a ground.     He has to believe it's not a fishing expedition for evidence and that there is good cause to think that the defendant will succeed.       Under those circumstances -- under -- which is pretty limited, under those circumstances, then he has discretionary authority to grant a hearing at which the defendant will be able to show -- you know, that there is not probable cause to believe a crime was committed by his client.       Well, it's about a different subject.     It's not we work through osmosis here.     It's about the subject of quashing a warrant, or it's about the subject of injunction.     Now, grant you, a grand jury thinks it's there, but it's also there, when you're talking about certain bail hearings.
12-484 +++$+++        I would just like to get to what I think is one of their arguments, and I'm having some -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right? And they say, read (m).     (M) says race is a motivating factor in an unfair employment situation. Now, we look to what the unfair employment situation is, at the beginning, unfair employment practice.     It is to dismiss a person because of race, all right?     So, obviously, it applies.     Now, we look to the definition that we're at issue in here.     It says it's an unfair labor practice to dismiss a person because of retaliation.     Now, retaliation for what?     For race, that's true. But we're -- we couldn't care less about whether that race is part or a little bit or it's all -- it could even be totally unjustified.     What we're interested in is the retaliation.     So they say, you see, the words of (m) do not speak about race.     They speak about retaliation.     They speak about race. So whatever the policy reasons are, you can't do it any more than if you have a statute that refers to carrots and you try to put in a beet.     You just can't do it.     Now, that's the answer -- I -- I would like to hear an answer.       So you have to say retribution for race is race?     Yes.       Now -- now, what I was looking for, perhaps without success, is some other example that has nothing to do with retribution, but where that's clearly so, that's why the example came into my mind that it is possible that you could, under the basic unfair employment section, find a person liable of race discrimination, even though that person himself was not motivated by race, but perhaps had an obligation to report a race discrimination, which he failed to do because he wanted to go to the racetrack. You see? I'm looking for some other -- is there any other example in the history of these statutes where we've said, you, Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, you are guilty of race discrimination, even though that's because of your responsibilities because of what you did or didn't do, it's not because you, yourself, held the motive, but you -- you'd attribute the motive to them for reasons to do with the statute. Is there -- does that ring any bell at all?       Now, I have looked -
12-515 +++$+++    Yes, but he was wrong on that, apparently, if that's what he says. He was wrong, that, if we look at the cases, what we will see is it was the courts that said there's a common law abrogation of France's sovereign immunity, when they go into business in downtown Iowa somewhere.   The same thing -- same thing with the State, he says in Nevada and California, and then he says it would be totally anomalous to think that an Indian tribe could go into downtown Des Moines and open up a clearly illegal business, and you could sue France -- the State, which was not Kiowa -- they could sue -- France could -- the State could sue France, it could sue California, but it couldn't sue the Indian tribe.   All right. What about the California and Nevada?   Now, Kiowa is about  is it Kiowa? -- is about individuals who are not the State.   All right. I'll look at those with care. But, now, assuming you are right on that, is the question in front of us, on the assumption that these are Indian lands, does the Indian tribe have sovereign immunity? Is that the question you want answered?   Yes or no?   Do you want us to say on that assumption -- now, on that assumption, I look at i and number ii under a, 7 (a), and a quick reading of them suggests to me that they're in parallel, that the Indian tribe can sue the State when the State won't open negotiations, and the State or an Indian tribe can sue the Indian tribe when the Indian tribe refuses to follow the compact. Now, what's your answer to that?   Well, I know, but you said to decide this on the assumption that it's on Indian lands. If I make that assumption and then I look over and read i and ii, it sounds as if, as I said, i, the tribe can sue the State to get the compact; ii, the State can sue the tribe when it violates the compact.   That's why I want to  I'm trying to get what question I'm supposed to answer. If I'm supposed to answer the sovereign immunity question on the assumption that these are Indian lands, contrary to what was decided below, I might get one answer. But if I'm -- supposed to do it on the assumption that they're not Indian lands, I might get a different answer. What assumption am I supposed to make?   So you are prepared to live with the following: Is it the case that if California opens a business in a commercial activity in 20 other States, at least one of which it is totally illegal, this other State, say, Utah, cannot -- can sue California or not? What's the answer?   So what the opposition says, in your view, is absolutely correct, that a foreign nation opens up an illegal business in a State. The State can sue them, now, because of a treaty, but previously, because of the common law. If California opens up an illegal business, the State can put them out of business by bringing a suit. But an Indian tribe, they can't? That's the United States' view?   But I'm saying that is your view, though? I just want the bottom line.   Why? Because you are representing the United States. You have -- you understand Indian policy. This case has tremendous implications, if we follow your approach. It seems to me well beyond anything to do with gaming. My belief is Indian tribes all over the country operate businesses off the reservation, and businesses all over the country are regulated. And does the State, I guess, in your view, does not have the power to enforce the regulation against the Indian tribe.   Why is that -- not against the tribe itself. Why is that in the Indian tribe's interest? And is it a trap for the unwary lawyer? And how is this supposed to work out, in your view?
12-5196 +++$+++    An IRA.   He behaved very badly, and in view of this, I agree with that. Why wouldn't -- or why didn't the -- or why couldn't the trustee simply sanction? I mean, you have apparently the authority here in 105 to sanction conduct abusive of the judicial process. That includes an order directing payment of expenses. Okay. I guess this is an expense. And that wouldn't be discharged, because it's a postpetition debt. So why not just do that? And even if he doesn't have money now, if he ever gets any he's going to have to pay it. So it looks as if there's an alternative way of paying for this.   No, it doesn't. But why, when you have pretty clear language saying this shall not be used for administrative expense --   -- and you have general language over here saying a general power to sanction, and you have an alternative way that's perhaps almost as good, why read the language that says no to say, well, yes?   If he has the exemption, (k) says: "Property that the debtor exempts under this section is not liable for payment of any administrative expense." That's why I thought it seemed a fairly definite no, unless you read the general knowledge and tradition to mean yes.   But couldn't the couldn't the bankruptcy judge just deny him, deny him bankruptcy?   It made me think of a think of a bankruptcy petitioner who, in part, has a debt arising towards a creditor that consisted of the most frightful conduct you can think of. I mean, something really awful that he did to somebody. And yet that debtor can be excused, bankrupt, and keeps the $75,000. Now, while lying to a bankruptcy trustee is bad, it's not hard for us to think of conduct that's far worse. And yet, he can keep the $75,000. Why should -- why should this particular form of bad conduct allow the invasion of the homestead?   Is there any case law -- because 522 says in (b), it says "The following property may be exempt." It doesn't say it has to be. So is there any case law where the debtor writes down -- you know, a piece of property and a creditor comes in and says: He can't exempt that he has behaved outrageously, and it fits within the category, but he has behaved outrageously. Is there any case law that says under those circumstances the bankruptcy judge can refuse the exemption one way or the other?   I mean, you first have to get to the thing where the -- we are pretending to put the creditor, the bankruptcy judge, as if he were another creditor. The thing, the property, appears on a list that says exempt. And then the trustee or the judge says: No, I'm not going to let you exempt it. And that's basically what he's done.   You see what I mean? Not only is it administrative expenses, but you have to somehow say, well, the judge is a constructive creditor, and he constructively objected. There are an awful lot of "constructive's" in that sentence that I just gave you.
12-52 +++$+++        All right.     Now, don't lose that.     I will ask you this question to, which favors you in a sense but I want the answer really from the Solicitor General who may know.     But I'm going to ask it to you too because you've probably both thought about it.     He may have -- they may have some experience on it. Page 32 If you start talking about significant effect, without those last words, "deregulatory purpose" I suddenly worry about the following, that every city in the United States depends upon towing to regulate parking within the city.     We couldn't function without it, although none of us like it.     We know that it's necessary.     And certainly a law that provides for towing does directly regulate the service of the tow truck.     It says do it.     And then it tells you when not to do it. So what's the -- what happens?     Is every traffic law in the United States involving towing suddenly preempted?     I can't believe that.     How does this work?     So there is much more in significance in this case than the words we write, perhaps, than in the particular case. And now, do you want to, in light of what my concern is, add anything to what you say.     And you may not, the Solicitor General might, but I'd like to hear anything you have to say about that.       No, you -- you can just rest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's Page 33 going to have to write an opinion.     And we could just say that, but I -- I don't see I can -- my own problem is not being able to have an intelligent answer to that without having some answer to the bigger picture.     And the bigger picture seems to me horrendously important. And -- and I don't know what that answer is. You seem to be getting there with the words "deregulatory purpose."     And I -- and I was thinking how we might try to work with those, but go ahead.       Oh, I think it's much harder than this case --       -- because the relationship is -- is in the -- in the more general case is more direct to the tow truck.     It says "go tow."     And that's -- that's why I need some kind of bigger picture.       We have a statute which says, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours, you will be towed, okay?     And as part of that statute, though we don't see it, there is an arrangement for the service of the city with the tow truck company, which Page 34 says when the parking person calls you and says -- the meter says red, yellow, purple, green, you are to go there and tow, okay? Doesn't that sound as if it's regulating the service of tow trucks?     And I suspect across the country, there is some variation on that theme, but there are thousands of them.     And since the words -- I would be repeating it -- the words of this case may affect that situation, I want to know what you know, which may not be very much -- I don't blame you -- about that broader situation.       Or the opposite.       Correct.       Correct.       And they're -- they're very attractive places except in the winter. But a -- a motor carrier vehicle -- a service, transportation includes related to the movement of passengers or property.     Related to the movement of passengers or property.     So we have these words "related to" again.     I -- well, you've given me a couple of ideas, but I -- maybe they'll turn out not to be relevant, but -- but -- which I hope.      It seems to -- there --      Yes, you were right. There are two directions you could go.    But first I would like to know, it seems my guess is it is universally thought by cities that this Act does not preempt their normal parking regulations.     Am I right about that? Page 47       Okay.     Then we either have to take this tenuous, et cetera, this is too much, this isn't too much, da, da, da, or you've given -- there is another thought being thrown out and that is you relate it to the basic purposes of the deregulation act and you say that where the city is regulating something that never was, could not be, and is not part of a regulated or deregulated market, i.e. has nothing to do with the subject matter, then it is not preempted. Now, do you want us to take that approach? Should we punt and just use the words like "tenuous" or -- and if we take the implicit suggestion, what's the right way to do it?
12-536 +++$+++        That actually does very much -- while I don't -- I'm looking for an answer here. It's not that I have one at all.     It is rather basic, the point I think that's being made now.     I mean, as I understand it, the whole reason -- it is no doubt that campaign limits take an ordinary person, and they say, You cannot give more than such-and-such an amount. There are apparently, from the Internet, 200 people in the United States who would like to give $117,000 or more.     We're telling them, you can't; you can't support your beliefs.     That is a First Amendment negative. But that tends to be justified on the other side by the First Amendment positive because, if the average person thinks that what he says, exercising his First Amendment rights, just can't have an impact through public opinion upon his representative, he says, what is the point of the First Amendment?     And that's a First Amendment point.     All right.     So that's basic, I think. Now, once that's so, Congress has leeway. And you are saying -- and I have seen all over the place, that that's why we don't want those 200 people to spend more than 117- or 120,000 because the average person thinks the election is -- after the election, all the actions are affected by the pocketbook and not by the merits of the First Amendment arguments. Okay.     And now, you say the person can do the same thing anyway; just call it independent.     And what independent does, he can spend 40 million.     He can spend 50 million.     And all that does is sort of mix up the messages because the parties can't control it. Now, that's, I think, the question that's being asked.     And I think that that is a very serious question, and I'd like to know what flows from it.     Is it true?     So what?     What are we supposed to do?     What is your opinion about that question?       So what would you think?     I was just listening to your dialogue, and you heard - this is pretty tough, we try to construct some hypotheticals, and -- and the counsel says, oh, I've got this part wrong or that part wrong or the other one, and they may be right.     And we can't do this, figuring out all these factual things in an hour, frankly. And they may be right.     I'm not sure.     There hasn't been a full hearing.     It seemed to me there are things to explore in respect to the circumvention.     Who is right?     Should you change the hypothetical slightly, or what?     There are things to explore in respect to the question of whether being able to write a $3.6 million check to a lot of people does leave the average person to think, my First Amendment speech, in terms of influencing my representative, means nothing. There are things to explore in terms of the relationship between what is permissible; namely, spend $40 million independently.     And what isn't permissible; namely, spending more than 117,000.     None of these have been considered.     They would seem relevant. So what do you think about going into these matters in a district court where the evidentiary aspects of them can be explored at some length?       Well, if it's interrelated. But the -- the record, as far as I recall it from several years ago, talked about at length, I don't like to use the word "corrupting"; I like to use integration -- "integrity of the process," that notion of getting people to think that their First Amendment speech makes a difference, etcetera. Let's say "corruption."     Mostly when it got to this part, the aggregate, it was about circumvention. And I think you are quite right to say, but there is a huge corruption aspect to this. But we don't have a lot of information in the record about that, do we?     If I just -- did I just miss it?     Did I miss something?       Yeah.       It is a close parallel when I think about it, maybe -- or you think about it, but if you're really talking -- they don't think about it that way.     And so that's why I've been pushing this idea, you see, of let's go into this, okay?     If they want us to go into it, go into it.
12-547 +++$+++        How many holdings are there?       I take it the answer is zero, right?     I mean, I -       -- I looked at your brief, and then I looked at their brief, and they say the answer is zero.       All right.     And the -- the holding is that -- the pure holding would be, if the trial court judge says no, you cannot raise it, okay? The defendant is convicted and appeals.       And then he says to the appellate court, they wouldn't let me raise it.     And the appellate court says, you have a right to raise it.       That is Lynch.     And Lynch is what year?       In 1973.     Okay.     So we have one.       And -- and was there any other case in 1973 -- this is 10 years before.     Was there any other case in which the same pattern of facts and they said the same thing as Lynch?       No, but we -- we have got Lynch on one side.     Is there any case -- this is an intermediate appeals court -- is there any case in which the defendant says, I would like to raise it, the judge says no, convicted, appeal, and the intermediate court of appeals says, defendant, you are wrong?       Okay.     And so all this period from 1973 until 1995 or whatever -       Carpenter.       2001.     All right.       There is exactly one case on point which does favor you, and there are zero cases that favor them; is that right?       Well, Mangiapane was a -- a lot of words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that right?       Okay.       So we've got one. That's -- I'm trying to find out what the state of the art.       The state of the art is one for you, zero for them.       Yes.       There were no others, so, now, I've reduced your one to nothing to like .01 to nothing because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Chief Justice just pointed out, and, now, you've already said there were no other cases.       All right.     But that's because -- everybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you on this anyway.     I agree the bar puts it in the instructions, and, if the bar puts it in the instructions, people tend to follow it.     That's true. So it's not surprising that a lot of people tended to follow it. But, as far as court decisions are concerned, we have no -- what I'm trying to think of is a pre-statute.     I give you a little credit on that. That's Lynch.     Pre-statute -- and we have what I might sort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner. We've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong, and -- and, here, even though there are judicial mentioners, they get something. I don't know how much in the scale to -- to give them.       Can you think of a Federal case where -- I see what we have.     I'm now adding up the something for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is a -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that some courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to follow it, and there were others that mentioned it favorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.       Okay.     So -- so we've got that.     Now, actually, that Kentucky case, was it? Tennessee?       Yeah, Rogers.     That went against you.       All right.     All right.     But can you think of any Federal precedent on this issue that's come even close to that being sufficient?     What's your best?       I guess the alternative is you are going to allow the bar associations, helpful as they are, by writing instructions to determine issues that courts themselves have never determined -- or at least not authoritative supreme courts.     And that's a worrying matter, where you are trying to create coherent systems of law.
12-562 +++$+++        So what?       So what?     That is, I mean, as I understand it, you agree that, on the partnership level, the IRS could say the following in a hypothetical, I'll now give you the partnership says that this asset has a basis of $10 million.     We sold it for 8.     Therefore, the partnership has a loss of 2.     The IRS says the real value is not $10 million basis, it was a $2 million basis, and therefore, in fact, you don't have a loss of 2, you have a gain of 8. Moreover, your understatement was more than 400 percent or whatever the percent is -- you know, it was a -- it was huge.     It was an $8 million -- you know, overstatement and, therefore, penalties of 400 percent attach.     Okay?     You agree they can say that.       Yes.       At the -- I'm correct.       Okay.     I understand you're making this, but what they've actually done there, since it doesn't say anything about inside/outside, is they're saying, partners, to the extent that you use this on your own return, remember, there's a 400 percent penalty attached.     Okay.     You agree they can do that. Now, what they've done here is they've said, there is no partnership.     So to the extent that you use this as your -- as a basis, as you use this on your individual return, remember there's a 400 percent penalty attached because 4 times zero or whatever it is, you understand the mathematics. So we haven't got any reference to inside/outside basis here.     In both cases, it seems to me they're doing roughly the same thing.     And so where in the statute does it say they can't do it?     They're saying, indeed, a penalty attaches to -       -- the use of this partnership by you, the partner, to reduce your taxes.       Now, to the extent you don't use it, of course, you don't have to pay anything, but to the extent you use it, you have to pay whatever it is, plus the 400 percent.       So then the question is - the question is do the words "partnership item" in the section "scope of judicial review" refer only to those items that the partnership in fact is concerned with? Or do they consider the partnership itself?       That's the issue.     Okay.       We're interpreting the word "partnership items" in that statute, and you are saying the partnership itself is not a partnership item.       What?     No?       Oh, no, no, But I'm - that's just a question of how they use it on the return. There are many ways in which a person could use a partnership item on the return.     If this is a partnership item -- I mean, a person might, for example, have no tax, in which case -       I understand how someone could be confused, and I am genuinely confused.     I have read this several times.       And the reason I'm confused is this:     That I -- I understand your difference between the outside basis and the inside basis.     Now, what I'm trying to do is to figure out, via the statute, I think like what Justice Scalia was trying to do, I think, where does that matter?       No, I understand that, too. I'm just trying to get the precise words of the statute that it would make a difference because, in common sense, it doesn't seem to me to make much difference, but -- but maybe in this statutory language it does, so I want to know what words.       Okay.     Now, you just told me.     I said that, I thought, and you said, no, it didn't, those weren't the right words.     But if you say those are the right words, then explain to me why a partnership item cannot include a partnership itself.       Okay.     So no matter what kind of return you use, no matter what the tax situation, if the partnership real -- real value makes a difference, you have to put it in, don't you?       Yes, yes, in individual gift tax return.     Maybe it's in a State tax return. Maybe it's an income tax return.       So it affects the taxpayer differently, and I'm just saying, why does it matter?       -- that the way this affects the taxpayer is through what you call his outside basis.     Why does that matter?       Well, yes, yes.     But of course, any -- in my example, too, it will vary.     Of course, it will vary.     Some people will use -- have no tax to pay, no extra tax, because their -- their income tax that they paid was zero.     In fact, the government owed them a refund, so it didn't matter.     It varies in many ways. So since it varies in many ways and varies by many returns, it might vary depending upon whether it affected your outside basis or something else.
12-574 +++$+++       Well, I don't see how it arises in Nevada.    What they're saying is that some people in Georgia didn't give back some money that they took in Georgia.    To take your example, my question is this:    There could -- you say there are many, many, many cases.    We could get this all mixed up if we don't follow your rule.    All I want you to do is cite me a few, but the few that I want you to cite me will meet certain criteria.      For example, a college student goes into the bookstore, and it's also a pharmacy, by the way.    And he breaks his finger in the door.    It's his fault.    He says:    I am going home; send me some bandages.    The store never does.    "Send me some books; I just bought them."    The store never does.    They know his home address, all right?    Injury.    Now, what about those? Cite me some lower cases where they say there is jurisdiction in cases like that.      "Oh, I lost my billfold.    I lost it here in the store.    When you find it, will you send it back?"    They never send it back, though they found it.    All right. So just give me some lower court cases that finds jurisdiction in that kind of situation.      No, no, the injury -- my goodness, he lost his billfold.    There was money in it. And by the way, when he gets home, his parents are away, and he's not going to have any money to spend on food or even, like, CDs or anything. (Laughter.)      There is no jurisdiction in those cases where he lost his billfold in the bookstore in the college town 1,000 miles away from home, and he's going home, and everybody knows he's never going to have any money, and they keep the money.    Okay.    What's the difference?    If there are no cases on those, what is the difference between that case and yours?      Okay.    Now, give me the case that says that.      Is this is a case -- is this a case like -- I'll look at those cases.      But is your case a case like where the credit card is used, somebody finds it in a bookstore and starts spending the money and did the agents here, who were outside Nevada and they were keeping the money, were they going and spending it?      Was there a credit card that they were using?      I was trying to figure out just which cases I should read carefully and I will read those cases.      Yes.    Well, there seems to be because it's hard to think of an internet case where a defendant wouldn't be having communications with people in the -- State, wouldn't be inviting business, wouldn't be doing all kinds of things.    So there are many kinds of internet cases, but I don't -- I don't automatically see in deciding this that we're deciding any on.      Like what?      I wouldn't do that. (Laughter.)      What is the -- what are the elements of the second tort?      And what is the element?      The other element?      How do I find that? Because you see in the fraud case, the element includes the victims being misled.      But that's not necessarily true here.   I wonder -      It has to be a misrepresentation -      -- material to.      Material to?      Not here, but material to -- normally it has to be material to the obtaining the, say, of property.      Now, where do I find the elements of the tort that you are alleging here?      I don't see anything in the complaint that says anything like that.    It just says - where do I look to see it?      Because one of the elements of the crime in the second case, no element of the crime or no element of the tort, it's only the injury which isn't an element of the actual underlying behavior that gives rise to and in the first case it's the other. There is an element that takes place there.    That's what I'm looking for.      I'm looking for that.    I'm not saying that I have it.    That's why I asked you the question I did.
12-609 +++$+++        You're - you're -- the State admits that all that they could put on was information from the psychiatrist that is reasonably related to the defense that the defendant raised.     Do you disagree with that?       All right.     Then we both agree -       Fine.     You both agree that the test is "reasonably related."     So we could simply say that.     They both agree.       And now, we send it back to the Kansas court and say, we are not going to go through the record here because you should do it.       Then why are we here? Everybody agrees.       The authority for that is what?       Well, I mean -- you know, the obvious, it's not a question of policy.     But one thing, the Fifth Amendment prevents you from being a witness against yourself, you didn't take the stand.     So what you did was introduced three psychiatrists, and they said, this man was totally insane, he could form no will whatsoever, totally insane. The government says, we have seven psychiatrists who would like to examine this man, and they'll come to the opposite conclusion.     The judge says, okay, examine him, under compulsory.     And they say he is totally sane.     And they each have reasons. Now, you're saying, in that case, the government cannot put any of those seven on the stand?       Really?       No, but they -- they can base their testimony on an examination compelled by the -       All right.     So you -       But that -- that puts the government in a -- in an impossible position.     The defense is allowed witnesses who've examined the defendant and -- oh, you mean you're only limiting it to the case where the defense witnesses don't examine the defendant?       You're -- I'm giving you a hypothetical.       That's his conclusion. You're saying the government can put on its witnesses, but the Fifth Amendment prohibits the - sorry, the defense can put on its witness, but the - the Fifth Amendment prohibits the defendant from putting on its own witness?       That means it's something -- I can't imagine how the Fifth Amendment can say that.     But go ahead.       What is your argument?       No, no.     They put on my witness, my imaginary psychiatrist A.       Well, that may be, but does the Federal Constitution -- it's my example.     It's my example.       Because -       What do we do with this? The defense says, my defense will consist of the fact demonstrated by an expert that my heart is too weak to have made it up the stairs.     All right.     And I have Mister -- Dr. Smith, who has examined my heart, and he will testify it's impossible I could have been on the third floor, I would have been dead. So the government says, we would like to have you examined by our doctor, Dr. B, who we believe will -- and the judge orders it.     All right.     So now, Dr. B says, his heart is sound as an ox, and he goes to it.     You're saying the government could not put that Dr. B on the stand?
12-62 +++$+++        Well, it isn't, but that, I think, is an undecided question at best.     If you won the case on that ground, I would say that what the guidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at, gathering information from across the country, and saying a typical person who commits this crime in a typical way should be sentenced to the typical range that applies -- let's say 18 to 24 months. That would be down the drain.     And I think that Rita, in fact, and the other cases have, at the very most, left open and maybe decided against you the question of when a court of appeals gets the sentence from a judge who does not apply the guideline because he doesn't like the policy judgment. That's a different matter from when he applies it then when he thinks he shouldn't apply it because the person in front of him doesn't meet the -- the policy conditions.     Those are different.     The Commission has the expertise in the first, the judge in the second.     And so there is at least a question as to whether the court of appeals should give more leeway to the guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge in the second. Now, I think Rita is consistent with that, and I think every opinion we have written is consistent with that.     And I'd hate to see that suddenly decided and changed in a way I think is inappropriate in this case.     So have you all thought that through? And is the position of the government, now, that we think the guidelines, even if it's a policy matter that they have gathered evidence on, are entitled to nothing, if they run across a district judge who happens to think, though he was an outlier, that the outliers were right as a matter of policy, which, of course, will always be true.     Every judge who is an outlier thinks the outliers are right.     Otherwise, why would he do it?     You see? Now, I didn't know that issue was in this case and that changes the case dramatically for me.     And I thought we could decide this just on the ground that this is a law that changes punishment.     It's a law. It's a regulation. And Justice Scalia, I thought, was completely right.     The question is whether it inflicts greater punishment.     And there is a test on that, and the controlling inquiry is whether retroactive application of a change in a law that affects punishment created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached.     All right?     And that's -- that's what I thought the -- the framework of law was in this case. Now, this is sort of tough for you on oral argument because I'm just, perhaps, bringing it all up to get it all out there and see what you think.       I see -- I see, now, where you're going.     What I think you're saying is, whatever the sentence is, I am the judge, I read the guidelines. Now, I may think that I am more likely to get reversed if I -- I substitute a different view than the Commission had on a matter of policy.     That's all true. But, still, I don't have to do it.     No matter what it is, I can not use the guidelines.     And, if I get reversed on other grounds, or the sentence is not reasonable, da, da, da, da, da.     But there's no legal binding nature there.     That's your point, I think.       All right.     If that's exactly your point --       All right.     But, now, I can narrow what the question I think is.
12-682 +++$+++        Some people think that there is a difference between the plus and the minus. Some judges differ on that point.     Some agree sort of with you, and some agree sort of not.     All right?     Let's think of those who agree sort of, and then I have a question.     And you know this area better than I. So think of Grutter.     Grutter permits affirmative action.     Think of the earlier cases.     They permitted affirmative action where it was overcome, the effects of past discrimination, but probably not otherwise. Now, that's what I want to know.     Are there areas, other than education, where affirmative action would not be forbidden to achieve a goal other than overcoming the effects?     Have you got the question?     And does an answer come to mind?       Okay.     So there are a set.       Fine.     If there are a set, what I -- what I'd like you to explain, if -- if you can take a minute, is think of how a city is set up.     There are a vast number of administrators.     There are a vast number of programs.     It could be an administrator somewhere says he'd like to give a preference, maybe for good reason.     But then the city council votes no.     Or because there are other ways of doing it, by, you know, first come, first served or some other criteria that doesn't use race. Are all of those unlawful?     Every one?     Do you have to leave it up to the -- no matter what the subject, no matter what the -- or are you going to draw a line somewhere?     Is there a line that you could draw that would take your case on the right side from your point of view, but would say we're not giving power to every administrator in the city to decide on his own whether to use racial preferences without a possibility of a higher-up veto -       -- which I don't think you want to say, but maybe you do.       So what's the line?     Is there any line that you can say, look here.     We were trying to be very helpful, and all of a sudden they put this thing on the ballot, you can't even get it through. Okay?     That's your basic point. But -- but if you think of -- you have to write something, and that something has tremendous effect all over the place.     So what kind of line is there, in your opinion?       I'm not saying instead of political process.     Don't let me put words in your mouth.     Think what you think here. You say where the authority is divided in a certain way, and that is true under the constitution of the State.     So the State government lacks the power. And then you have to take the power from the people and change the constitution, and when you do that in respect to a benefit.     Then, in respect to benefits, Washington -- you know, Seattle and Hunter kick in. See, where are not dealing with past discrimination.
12-696 +++$+++       Are you -- I would like you to take into account an aspect of this.    I mean, in my own opinion, I don't know of anyone else's, I'm not talking for others.    But one -- a major purpose of the religion clauses is to allow people in this country of different religion, including those of no religion, to live harmoniously together. Now, given that basic purpose, what do we do about the problem of prayer in these kinds of legislative sessions?    One possibility is say, you just can't do it, it's secular.    But that is not our tradition.      All right.    The second possibility is the one that you are advocating.    And it has much to recommend it, try to keep non-denominational, try to keep it as inoffensive to the others as possible.    That's the upside. The downside is seeing supervised by a judge dozens of groups, and today, there are 60 or 70 groups of different religions coming in and saying, no, that doesn't work for us, this doesn't work for us, and that's the nightmare that they are afraid of. I mean, even in this town or in the area, there are significant numbers, as well as Christians, of Jews, of Muslims, of Baha'is, of Hindus, and others. All right.    So there's a third approach, and that is say, well, you can't have them if there's any aspect of coercion.    But we just saw people walking into this room, "God save the United States" and you want to win your case.    I didn't see people sitting down. All right.    Then the fourth approach, which is the other that has -- makes its appearance here, is to say let's try to be inclusive.    Now, was enough -- in other words, so you didn't get the right prayer today, but you -- and even with the nonreligious, you know many believe in the better angels of our nature and the spiritual side of humankind; it's not impossible to appeal to them.    So you say, you'll have your chance. And that's the thing I -- I would like you to explore.    I mean, is there a way of doing that or is that preferable to the other ways or do we get into trouble?      Congress has a set of guidelines which you've read and are here in the papers and so forth.    Are those satisfactory to you?      If those are satisfactory to you, then I wonder, are they satisfactory to everyone.    And -- and you will find all kinds of different beliefs and thoughts in this country, and there will be people who say, but I cannot give such a prayer if I am a priest in that particular -- or a minister or whatever in that particular religion.    I must refer to the God -- to God as I know that God by name.    And what do we do with them? That's what -- I mean, we can recommend it, but can we say that the Constitution of the United States requires it?      Suppose you did this.    You combined your two approaches.    The town has to -- it cannot -- it must make a good faith effort to appeal to other religions who are in that area.    And then you have these words from the House:    "The chaplain should keep in mind that the House of Representatives, or you would say whatever relative group, "is comprised of members of many different faith traditions," period, end of matter. Is that sufficient, those two things?
12-71 +++$+++        His point is, he keeps making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that isn't what it says.     What the statute says is it may require only such identifying information as is necessary to assess eligibility.     In other words, it's telling the people who write the form what they can put on it.     And they can't put other things on it.     But it nowhere says that the State can't do other things. Now that's his point.     And when I asked him, well, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be able to use, oh, he says, we use it.     We use the citizen part and these things on the form to prosecute people for perjury.     So we're doing what it says, we're using it and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things. Okay.     Now, that's his argument.     Now, your answer, which would be very helpful to me, is?       On the form.       But his problem is how do you get to that conclusion?     He says you can't get there from the language because the language doesn't say that. It says what the Commission can put on the form.     It doesn't say anything about whether some other agency, Page 37 such as a State or -- you know, a sovereign, can add something. Now, that's his problem.     And I would like to hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about that is?       26H.       Yes.       Correct.       No, no.     Where you're going is this, as I heard you before:     It is true that there is no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't add things.     But it does make a huge point approving citizenship in a particular way on the form.     What would the point of that be if the State could add things? So we must look back to the purpose, not necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what that particular provision be, in particularly one as you quote adding to, what could it have been?     And there the legislative history in my view is helpful because it makes clear, for example, in at least one place that Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that allows the State to do just what it's doing here because that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act. Page 40 So I'm putting words in your mouth, but don't accept them because I put them there. (Laughter.)       And that's the grand purpose -- to go back to your -- I see that as your grand purpose.     That's the grand purpose argument.     And then there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you Page 54 started to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do with (b).     It says may require only such identifying information.     So I thought, well, they could require less, less than what's necessary.     They could.     It says you can't require more.     They could require less. But suppose they put a statement in and they say, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do with citizenship:     This is what is necessary.     No more. But we've done everything that is necessary.     Then could a State come along and say, we think more is necessary?       And it's the word "necessary" that you thought -- that that would be dependent upon?       Well, I know I'm not -- I'm just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to think up was this --       It does say "may require Page 55 only"       -- "that which is necessary."     So if they said -- and this what is necessary.     Fine.     Pretty tough for the State to say I'm going to add some things.     But the very next subsection does use the words "shall include."     So I wonder -- and that has to do with citizenship.     So I wonder if that is a statement by Congress that in respect to citizenship, that is what is necessary.
12-729 +++$+++        I suppose the problem here is that we have found nine cases -- you know, we can do computer-assisted research, which my clerks are good at -- and -- and they found five cases in which the exhaustion period was actually longer than the 3-year statute of limitations.     And then they found four others that there -- well, there was like 5 days left in one, and there was 5 months left in another.     And in most of -- almost all those cases, the judge got around the problem by saying the statute begins to run at the time the exhaustion is finished. Now, I can think of other ways of solving the problem.     One was, you get a reg.     Another way was that we interpret the exhaustion doctrine to require leaving at least a year.     But what's your way of solving the problem?     Are you just going to let those nine people just -- they can't bring their lawsuit, or what?       The question was, what do you want to do with those nine people?     Now, I know there are a lot of ERISA cases, but still there were nine people -       -- who will have this problem.     And my question is, what do you suggest we do about them?       My question was, what specific doctrine or -- I saw three groups.     Now, you can name some others, and we do about those nine people precisely, not in some general terms, but we do what about them?       And now, I suppose -- so we could use equitable estoppel, even though nobody has said anything, even though nobody held out anything as a basis for estoppel.     But we could say use equitable estoppel.     I'll think about that one. Is there any other thing we could use?       There, your opponent is saying, I have a simpler answer.     I mean, instead of having to worry whether 14 months is too long or 7 months is too short or a year and a half is adequate time, instead of having to worry about that in difficult cases, I have a simpler idea.     We will just run the three years from the time the -- the internal exhaustion is finished.     Then you don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about equitable tolling, and you don't have to worry about all this other stuff.     That's their point.       The -- the question I would like to know is if you know empirically, roughly, what are typical statutes of limitations in this area?     The basic rule is State law unless contract, is that right?       And how long on average? Do you have any idea of -- of how long people normally have to bring their action?       It's the standard provision in contracts?       Well, I mean -- in certain types of insurance contracts.     So ERISA is all over the place.     I wouldn't even know where to start.     Does the Department of Labor keep statistics on this or what?       It's -- the doctrine of exhaustion is a judge-created doctrine.       And therefore you cannot, in your contract, contract yourself around it.     You can't get out of it.       So what this would require would be to say that that judge-created doctrine requires exhaustion to take place before the accrual of the statute of limitations, end of opinion.     For the reason of certainty, for the reason of uniformity, for the reason of avoiding, through hiring lawyers, et cetera, an interference with the voluntary nature, simple nature, and hopefully pre-legal involvement nature of that exhaustion process, all right?     Da, da, da. Now, the reason -- what trouble would that cause?       What trouble in the industry would that cause?       Look, you agree that we would overturn the plan term if the plan term was no exhaustion?       The courts would overturn a plan term which plan term said no exhaustion.       Of course not because what we are trying to do -- and employers are very cooperative and we are trying to work out a system with the exhaustion thing that will not destroy ERISA plans or something.       It -- it's which is the - and that's why I phrased it in terms of an explanation of the exhaustion requirement.
12-751 +++$+++    I would say that -- well, what the problem -- but can you give me any example of any case? There may be so many you can't even give me your best one. But trusts have been around for probably 800 years. And can you give me an example of one where a court said a trustee has breached its fiduciary obligation because he failed to use inside information?   You think there is not such a case?   Fine. If there is not such a case, what's the problem? Because what's the rock and the hard place?   The person has an obligation to act prudently in respect to the fiduciaries -- to the beneficiaries, of course. But he cannot, irrespective of that, have an obligation to use inside information. End of the matter. What -- what's wrong with saying just that?   What I mean by it is just what I said. There is no rule of trust or ERISA law that you can breach a duty to a beneficiary by failing to use inside information, period. I don't know what the SEC's brief is. I'm going to ask --   -- the SG what their opinion is because they don't seem to appear on this brief.   The answer is there's not been a case ever holding the contrary --   -- but you yourself disagree with it.   Now, what the reason you disagree with it?   I'm sorry. I'm saying go back to England. There are many cases where settlors have said what kinds of things you should invest in, and they invest in them. They have inside information that it is a bad investment. Is there any case that says they have a duty of obligation not to do what the settlor says? I wouldn't have been surprised if you had found some cases, but I'm also not surprised that there aren't any. That's why I asked the guestion.   Here when you say -- I am totally with you on this. We walk into the trustee's office. It's like Ralph Nader investigating the FTC years ago. There is someone asleep on the sofa. In his inbox is ten feet of papers telling him about all public -- telling him about the corporation's condition. It's apparent he's never read them. If he had read them, he would have taken action. Of course you would have a case, I would think.   But you want to go beyond that?   Not just information. Remember I carefully said all this was publicly available information. You want to say it also applies when it's not publicly available information. Am I right or wrong?   In a way, what happens is that the trustee, knowing that the company has announced an enormous oil strike, is having to sit on a private meeting where three people come in and you say, yeah, there was an oil strike, but it's impossible to get the oil out. Ha, ha, we put one over on that time. Okay.   Now, what's that trustee supposed to do?   No. There's a false.   He alone, when two other people, know that this oil is worthless. The market doesn't. It's totally inside information. What, in your opinion, is he supposed to do?   Okay. So your answer is, totally inside information, he sells, right?   Well, the -- the union brief says the thing to do in that situation is, without saying anything, turn the trusteeship over to a person who doesn't have that knowledge. That takes care of the problem. And the reason I raised the guestion, of course, is there are trillions of dollars probably managed by ERISA funds. I don't know what percentage of those involve stocks. Not this kind -- of this kind. Maybe you know, but my guess is a lot. And obviously, before I wrote a word that said what you have to do or don't have to do with inside information, I would like to know directly, not indirectly, what the SEC thinks.   And maybe you can tell me. But the SEC isn't here. And at least there's no SEC lawyer that signed your brief. So I don't know the extent to which that's --   It might be you might have a good reason for it.   But right now I am supposed to write some words or join some words.   And those words will tell trustees of possibly -- I have no idea -- but maybe hundreds of billions, or maybe billions anyway, of -- of assets in the stock market, what they're supposed to do when they learn some inside information that affects the company's stock. And I hate to tell you, I don't know anything in this area about what the likely effects are. And, therefore, I'd like to know what they think. And the closest I came to it was the AFL-CIO brief, frankly, where they said what you're supposed to do here is -- is turn this over. So what do I do?   But the market will see through that in about two seconds. But the --   That isn't really my guestion. It's a numerical guestion. What -- you know, I was making up numbers wildly. What are the actual numbers? That is, approximately how much in assets is accounted for by ownership of the company's -- you know, this kind of a plan where you buy the company's stock. Do you know?   About?
12-7515 +++$+++       I accept that.      Well, here -- here I accept that -- first of all, there's no problem with intent for me for the reason Justice Scalia pointed out, that anyone who sells heroin to someone is reckless, at least, in respect to the possibility of a death resulting.    So I think that's enough to bring them within the intent problem.    Also, there was a death here; fine.    But still you have to show cause. And this is this unusual situation, which the Brown Commission expresses itself upon and which the model Penal Code didn't.      And the model Penal Code did express itself on what they call, in the Brown Commission, concurrent causes, all right?    It has to be a but-for or a concurrent cause.    But a concurrent cause is the situation where there are two people striking a mortal blow.    Therefore, either is sufficient.    And if, in fact, the second wasn't sufficient, then the first is a necessary condition.      All right?    So here we have the separate problem which has been pointed out that not only -- we don't know if the others were sufficient, nor do we know if this was a necessary condition.    And Brown and 5 States tell you what to do in such situation to fall within the definition of cause.    And the model Penal Code where you have Professor Wechsler debating Professor Hall with Dean Griswald throwing in the odd comment decided not to tell us its view.    Okay? So that's where I stand.    And you can correct that if you want, but I'm beginning to think that probably, at least it should be important in such a situation, and that the word "substantial" better connotes the idea of it being an important factor than the word "contributing," which means picks up all kinds of quite unimportant factors.    That's where my thinking is, and anything -- I just say that in case you want to respond to that.      No, but it doesn't say - the one they quote in their brief, all they wanted the judge to say was it could be -- they say, you are right, proximate cause, but they're interested here in is it a cause at all.    And they say:    "As long as the subject cause contributes substantially to producing the death." That's what they wanted him to say.    And he didn't say it. And actually when I read that, I thought, well, what they want is to say that it's an important factor, rather than just saying it's some unimportant factor.    And they seem, I don't know what these words really mean, but it seems they are closer to what you're saying should be the law than you are.      What do you want us to say? You know what's actually worrying me about this case? It took quite a long time, and there are like three levels of complexity, and we are from but for into concurrent and then the sufficient condition and the necessary condition.    And we are trying to argue whether this thing that the Model Penal Code wouldn't even pick up in Brown ought to be the Federal law of the United States. And Professor Wechsler's reaction was: Look, this is -- this going to arise so infrequently, it's so complicated to talk about, that you are going to mix everybody up once we start to write on this. And that is worrying me as a real problem. Once I start to write in this area, we are going to get people so mixed up no matter what we say -      -- that I hesitate to go backwards from the very vague and open language, substantive, substantial versus contributing, and just sort of why not just say substantial and leave it there and let the lower courts figure it out, so we don't confuse the entire bar and the entire Congress and everything.      I am.
12-761 +++$+++  
12-7822 +++$+++       Smith goes up to the house and Mrs. and Mr. Jones -- Mrs. Jones:    Please come in. Mr. Jones:    Stay out.    Well, I mean, Randolph says most people wouldn't go in, in those circumstances. So now Mrs. Jones says:    Tell Smith -- my husband, rather:    Smith, you tell my husband that there's a telephone call for him at the local pharmacy, and so he does so now he's not there.    And so now they can go in.    I mean, that seems like more fantastic than people entering the house in the first case. And so there does seem to me to be a real problem, if you write Randolph and agree to it, as I did, that you're going to say, okay, the police can just get him out of the way for a little while, legitimately, get him out of the way, maybe there really was a phone call, and now they go in the house.    I mean, I don't see how I could write that without saying I was wrong in Randolph, which I still think I was right.    So therefore I --one thing here.    What about saying that that "stay out of my house" is at least valid for a reasonable time thereafter?    And an hour and a half is not a reasonable time thereafter, at least when -- when the police got him out of the way.      That's all true, but can you answer my straight-faced question, which is how can I do this with a straight face, both come out one way in Randolph and say when the police get him out of the way knowing about what he doesn't wan, that's all different. Can you explain how I can do that with a straight face?      I don't think there's - reading your brief and the other, I don't think this is a case where she wanted to talk to the police.    Is it? The policeman says he wants to get in there because he's afraid a hostage -- a child is being held hostage.    And why wouldn't that give him grounds for -- was it an exigency?    I mean, why wouldn't he get in on other grounds there?    The exigent circumstances, the child might be held hostage.    Isn't that a good ground for going in immediately without a warrant?      Yes.      Yes.    They say they can do that.    So the problem is when they came back.      Okay.    When they came back, and she says apparently -- or what they give the impression, as I read it quickly, that it isn't a case where when they came back, she wanted particularly to give evidence to the police.      So everything here -- the things -- the everything -- the search at issue was a search solely for evidence?      The objecting party was present and made his objection known clearly and directly to the officers seeking to enter the house?      A little earlier, but he did. The officers did not justify their search on grounds of possible evidence destruction.    And as far as the record reveals, the officers might easily have secured the premises and sought a warrant permitting them to enter. All these factors are there, and the other offsetting factors, that the officer -- the invitation could reflect the victim's fear about being left alone with an abuser.    No, because he's not there.    It could also indicate the availability of the evidence in the form of a willingness to speak that might not otherwise exist.    As far as we know, that isn't present. Therefore, it fits totally within Randolph, but for one thing:    The police themselves took him away. Now, I mean, it's not -- it's not really a subterfuge, but it might look like that you've just eroded Randolph for no reason to get around your point by saying at least that known consent -- I mean known objection -- has enough force to last for a reasonable time, which isn't the best way of writing perhaps a Fourth Amendment opinion.    But it does have the - leaves it up the lower courts to figure out what is, and it maintains some life in Randolph. Okay.    That's a fairly long question, but you see where I'm going.    And your -- your answer is what?
12-786 +++$+++    My problem is I have no idea. I mean --   I have no idea whether they should be liable or not on a theory of patent infringement themselves. It sounds simple when you take the invention that you gave, but it doesn't sound simple to me when I start thinking about this one, because this one does seem to me a variation on a very old theme. And that is a supplier who makes customized materials, some of which involve standardized materials and some of which have to be made fresh, and where the specialists are in crowded cities. But -- and so it takes time to put it on the truck and get out of the city. But the standardized parts can be shipped from anywhere in the country. Has a system of phoning up standardized people and customized people and putting them all together, and it involves the customer. And there are not just two steps. There are 87 steps, and many of them involve very innocent things like taking a truck and driving it from one place to another. Now, when we get into something as complicated as that -- and this is one is even more so -- and many of them are things that people do every day, and there are all kinds of states of knowledge, I become very nervous about writing a rule that suddenly might lead millions of people to start suing each other. And that's what I would not like to do unless I have pretty thorough briefing on this subject.   And of course, my problem is a rule. And if this is a simple case, it's hard to me. Why do they have a patent? Well, they do have some forward warehouses and they had -- phone up and say, which one comes from which place? But, you see, I don't understand the underlying stuff. So they probably have a valid patent. I assume that. But for some of them, could be 87 steps, and I don't have one rule for four steps and another one for 87.   And I'd have the same question, by the way, as to 271 (b), exactly the same question. For X number of years, the patent bar and everyone else has lived with the statute and the interpretations which are different from this one. And now suddenly we have a new one. And I get the -- and now do you understand my question? Can you apply it to this one, too, and explain why we should say the Federal Circuit is right to depart from a pretty clear understanding differently?   And my question is one you probably can't answer, which is a problem because you have limited time, and the way -- you have such limited time in these complicated cases. And my problem is, the question is this is so complicated. And the reasons I found it so complicated is I can -- and I'll spare you the details -- think of so many different kinds of situations with so many different steps in method patents where so many rights and wrongs of it are differently at play that I become worried about setting forth any rule. And it's under those circumstances that I say okay, let's go with what we've had for 30 years, and if Congress feels they should change it, change it. And that's the --   -- that -- that is basically my idea. And it depends upon the complexity, which I'm seeing in my -- as -- as I think about it.   And it doesn't depend just upon that there were 4 steps in this case, because there could have been 104.   There could have been 104 different circumstances.   Yes.   Yes. Well, anything about (a) and also about (b), because (b), if you're liable under (b), my goodness, you could become more easily liable perhaps or less easily in some circumstances, but you didn't even -- I mean, it's the same question for (a) and (b).   Go with what you have because I don't understand it well enough to know all the facts and circumstances to which I would be applying a new rule.
12-79 +++$+++        That's true, suppose -- I think what is difficult to define -- Jay Fisk gets into his horse and carriage, drives up and down Wall Street, and says, "I'm going to buy Union Pacific, I'm going to buy Union Pacific," knowing that people will, in fact, all run out and buy it quickly, and what he really intends to do is, when it comes out, he didn't, he's going to sell outright. Anyway, typical fraud.     Now, that is certainly covered.       All right.     So -- so now, here, what we have is Mr. Stanford, I guess, saying to people, "I'm going to buy securities, I'm going to buy securities."     And maybe he didn't.       Just like Jay Fisk.       Okay.     So why does the first fall within and not the second?       You mean, in other words, if they had done exactly the same thing, but with an intent or -- or maybe and the affect of a purchaser of stock or a seller of stock reacting to the statement, then it affects it?       Okay.     Where neither of those is present, it doesn't.       Okay.
12-794 +++$+++    A low IQ and a personality disorder, I take it, were the mitigating factors?   So in a case where there are witnesses who says there are two mitigating factors, he has a very low IQ and he has a personality disorder, he says nothing. The jurors go in the room. They have to decide does he have a low IQ and personality disorder and what weight should we give that as mitigators? This instruction says, jurors, do it. Just, when you do it, don't take account of the fact that he, himself, did not testify.   Is that -- that -- so that jurors are perfectly clear, I would think. What I think is difficult for you is just what your friend raised. It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt. You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut out "guilt" because this has nothing to do with guilt, right. Estelle says, I would think, that you have a right to a Carter instruction in respect to some sentencing factors, namely future dangerousness. The last sentence on the page of Mitchell says, we are not deciding whether you're entitled to that instruction in respect to other sentencing factors, namely, remorse. So the question for you is why does that thing -- that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is entitled to that instruction here? And your response to that is what?   What I say -- what we said here, what I've gathered from the record, as best we've been able to see it, is in that sentencing hearing -- you were there?   But you know it pretty well.   Okay. There were five matters at issue. He had a low IQ, a personality disorder, the child of a troubled home, he had grown up in poverty, he had been sexually abused. All right. All of those things are basically factual matters about his background. Now, in that context, this instruction, which was the Carter instruction without the word "guilt," referring to his failure to testify is -- doesn't mention those five things specifically. It doesn't say testify about those five things. But in context, was there anything else in that hearing that the jury could have thought failure to testify referred to?   Is there anything else any juror might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about this other thing, too? Was there some other thing there?   That's not what I'm thinking of.   I'm thinking of what is it that we -- is there an issue in this case about whether the instruction, on top of whatever other problems it had, was too broad? So I'm thinking, if that was the only issue, if those are the only issues that this instruction could have been thought of as referring to, we don't have to get into the breadth matter. That's why I ask you. Was there something else in that hearing that the jury might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about it?   He's got the point. But you have to answer, in terms of what the facts are at the hearing.   But was his remorse an issue at the hearing?  Then the answer --
12-815 +++$+++       Does it matter if it's just purely Federal law?    I mean, think of a civil case involving a State on one side and private parties on another in a State court which has jurisdiction over Federal laws.    The State claims that the defendant has violated, civilly, a Federal statute.    There's an action also in Federal Court.    In your view, does the Federal Court have to abstain?      No, no.    There's no action for an injunction.    What they want is the judge to decide the case.    The private party wants the Federal judge to decide his case.    That's all.    It's a matter of interpreting Federal law. Now, in your opinion, is Younger -- does Younger, not some other doctrine, does Younger require abstention?      Yes.    Okay.    So on your review, we can never have a case proceed in Federal court even on a purely Federal issue if, in fact, there is involving this estate civil case on the same question.      Yes.      Well, I can't think of a - doesn't it often happen that there are such cases?    I mean, I -- I would think that wouldn't be too difficult. I mean, either there never is one and you tend to be right or there are a whole lot of them and you tend to be wrong.    I've just never heard it put in that extreme way, and maybe you're right.    I don't know.    What's your -- do you have authority for it or any light to shed?      Does Younger say "before"?      Does Younger say "before"?      You just said before.      No.    So -- so in your view, it doesn't matter which is brought first, I guess.      If Younger only applies to -- to State proceedings that are brought first, then I guess we could have a -- a criminal defendant, who's not yet one, bring an action in Federal court to say that the law is unconstitutional or something or violates a Federal law.    And then the State prosecutes him criminally and the Federal court couldn't -- and the Federal court could enjoin the criminal proceeding.      So we've said they can't -- you can enjoin a criminal decision -- a criminal proceeding in a State court as long as the criminal proceeding wasn't brought first.    Is that what this Court has said?      No, no.    There is a pending one by the time they get around to it.    Then what?    I mean, I -      I'll ask you to clarify. You've come up with a couple of rules that strike me as counterintuitive and so I'm trying to figure that one out.    The before or after one doesn't seem to work too well in my mind, because it would seem, you know, you couldn't -- Federal court couldn't.    Federal court could enjoin a criminal proceeding that came up later in your view, I guess.      All right.
12-820 +++$+++    Well, what is the answer? I'd like a straight answer in your opinion because Justice Kagan's case, the mother kidnaps the child. They live in a grain elevator -- a nicely refurbished grain elevator, in Peoria for a year. And after the year, a month later. The father finds both of them, goes to a family judge -- a very tough job by the way -- and the family judge reads this, and he says, well, I have to admit the child is settled here now in Iowa. All right. It's settled.   But send the child back to London, he's going to be just about as settled. I mean, really, it's not that much difference, but I can't say the child is not settled. The father says this is the most unfair thing I've ever seen. She hides out for a year. The child would be just as well back in London. Almost as well. Who knows? Maybe better. But now, what can the family court do -- judge do? That's the straight question we've been trying to get your answer to that, and it isn't an answer to say -- you could say, if that's the answer, I don't know.   No, what can they do? I just want to know if the family court judge will say please settle this, and the two of them won't.   And so, now, what can the judge do? Is the father simply out of luck or not?   But can you give me any authority? I read that exactly in Article 12, but you've now given me a different impression. What Article 12 says is that, if it's less than a year, the child is returned forthwith. If it's more than a year, the child shall be returned forthwith, unless -- unless it is demonstrated the child is now settled in its new environment. It doesn't say you don't return it if the child is now well settled in the environment. It just says you don't have to return it forthwith.   So I would have thought that that would have opened room for discretionary factors, but you have not given me a case that said that that's so. You have not given me anybody who said that what I thought was the natural reading and which you'd like to be the natural reading, you've not given any support for the proposition that it is the natural reading.   So I should read that case because the language says, "Unless it is demonstrated the child is now settled, you return it forthwith, unless it is demonstrated the child is well settled." Well, now, it's demonstrated well settled. Does that mean I cannot return it? Or does it mean I don't have to return it?   And I say -- or you say I read that case in the House of Lords, and I will discover it means you don't have to return it.
12-842 +++$+++    Could we say no to that and just say, look, here is the difficult question in the case, of course, every subpoena -- every subpoena has to have limits, and the limits are typically limits that have to do with the purpose of the subpoena, and where a sovereign is involved, maybe a District Court has to be more careful, but you are indeed searching for information in respect to assets out of the country that you could execute upon? Make that assumption with me for a second.   And that's the kind of thing you want to levy on. Okay. Fine. Now, if there were property in the United States and it were against a private person, another private person could get the information. If it was against a sovereign, the private person could get the information. If it's abroad and the shops are in Sicily, a private person can get the information despite the fact that to know about levying, you may have to know a lot about Italian law. Now, if it is a sovereign that you are trying to get the information, the other side is saying that's different. You say, why? Why -- I knew you were going to say why. And the answer is going to be because there could be various interferences. We can't even tell you exactly what. But you're talking about every country in the world. Who knows? Now, assume that there is something to their answer. Then where are we legally? We may be back A, before the Tate letter, in which case we could say to the State Department, if you see such a problem, come in and tell us, or we could say to the District Courts, go ask the State Department case by case. If Congress wants to make a rule later, they can, but they haven't yet. Or we could say something else. That's the question -- those are the questions that I would like answered.   Can you do this in discovery normally? Can't someone go in and say I don't think -- I think the subpoena or this order is too broad. It will do da, da, da. There isn't that much need for it. Please don't do it, judge. And the judge has a lot of discretion to say no.   All right. Now, is there any objection on your part, which there may well be, if we were to say one of the problems here is that this order, although they may have reason for it, is requiring discovery of airplanes, it's requiring discovery of consulates, it's requiring discovery of all of these other things, things that at least presumptively our statutes would not allow them to execute upon. Before you give an order allowing discovery of that kind of thing, judge, you'd better have very good reason for it.   No, I'm not saying that -- no. I'm just saying where it is on its face something that couldn't be discovered.   Something that couldn't be executed upon.   Be very, very careful. We do those things, and they are very often ignored, but nonetheless --
12-8561 +++$+++    Can we with ease say, look, it's very complicated. I can think of some answers, but they're too complicated for me to tell you what they are. And Justice Scalia has a possible answer. Justice Alito, it seemed to me, is pointing out that the second person to look at the thing, if they're only two, probably adds a lot of damage, but the 1000th person compared to 999 is near zero. Now, do we count this defendant as Number 2 or do we count him as Number 1000? Very hard to answer, no answer, really. But can we say, we can't answer how you do this in practice. Leave it to the sentencing commission. That's their job. Now, can we say that?   Yes.   But can we say -- can we suggest that the sentencing commission -- you can't order them to do it, of course not. But can we suggest that this is the kind of problem, very difficult, technically several ways to do it, that they can go into this. Is that true, that they could go into it and recommend or perhaps order?   Why? I mean, the person didn't cause the full amount. I mean, do you think Congress didn't intend -- do they want to have people pay for injury they didn't cause?   Well, if you think he caused the full amount, fine. But, I mean, immediately, you'll say at least they have four other people that they prosecuted for this, and those people caused it just as much, and so let's divide it by five.   So -- so contributed, also, a person who didn't have a picture of her, but watched other victims.   That person contributed to her, too, because it creates a market for the entire situation. So some limiting principle has to come into play, and the limiting principle that I think people are driving at is, because there's a terrible crime, we don't convict the person who didn't do it, all right? And similarly, because this is a terrible crime, you don't require a person to pay what he didn't cause. Now, that's sort of a principle going on. Now, if you accept that, at least hypothetically, can you give any answer -- I'm afraid you can't and you're going to say --   But answer to what seems to be bothering me and a lot of others is, okay, let's accept the notion of cause, but what is a -- this is called restitution --   -- it isn't called fines. And so, given that, what -- how do you do it? How do you distinguish, so she gets some reasonable amount? How do you do it that you're -- I can think of -- we've had about four different suggestions here. But what's your opinion, if you lose on the first? What's the best way to do it? That's what I think people are struggling for -- with.   That's what I suspected you would say. (Laughter.)   Well, what about doing -- what you'd say is make the department, you can find out figures, you could find out from figures what's the likelihood that X number of people will be caught. And say it's 3 out of 1,000. Then what you do is you divide by three. I mean, that way, everybody would be treated fairly, and moreover, the victim would at least have a shot at getting --   And how many -- how many are going to get caught and convicted?   Well, you can find out. There's no -- it's not an impossible question for people to come in and use the numbers and figure it out. My guess would be a very tiny percent.   All right. Fine. Then she's going to get a lot of her -- then she's going to get from each one a pretty good share, only --
12-872 +++$+++        But, I mean, that -- this is supposed to be fairly realistic, I think, what we're supposed to do.       There's no real possibility that any court is going to find that your client was, in fact, an employee without GERA.     That's what you said; is that right?       It's a different statute. But just without GERA -   -- he's a political appointment or whatever it is, so he's not within ADEA. That's what I think this is about.       That's correct?       And you agree with that?       Okay.     Then thank you very much.     And then my argument comes into play that we shouldn't be deciding issues of an advisory nature that do not involve individuals who fall within the statute that someone once interpreted.       What about doing -       What if the -- is there anything unfair about this?     I think Justice Ginsburg wrote an opinion in -- I recall a Third Circuit case involving ERISA or some medical thing, and an issue came up that was quite relevant, and nobody had really thought about it before or done much about it.     And what she wrote, to my recollection, is, well, we would like the advice of the lower court if they want to give it. And so we send it back for the Third Circuit to consider whether it's appropriate to reach the issue and, if it is appropriate to reach the issue, do so. Or, if they think the district court should reach it, do so.     In other words, we can't figure it out at this moment what's fair in terms of the entire litigation. Now, would that -- would that be a serious problem for you or your client?
12-873 +++$+++    But it nonetheless illustrates --   But it illustrates the point. I mean, in my own mind, the standing guestion is designed to answer, are you the kind of plaintiff that Congress intended, in this statute, to protect against the kind of injury that you say you suffered? Now, that goes back to Justice Brandeis, and it goes back to saying, did you suffer a common law injury, or do you fall within the scope as defined? Normally, Congress doesn't think about that, and so courts decide, and we're right in the middle of that decision. So if I think that, basically, you have a point, that at least the supplier who is mentioned in the defamatory statement by the competitor who bought the supplies, at least where he is mentioned explicitly, there should be standing, which means your side would win, I guess. What do I write to tie that in to the three separate kinds of tests that the circuits have talked about? That's what I can't guite see because they talk about the reasonable interest test, they talk about the zone of interest test, they talk about some other kind of test. How do I tie this into that?   If that's so -- if you go back and you just lift the APA test -- because I think Justice Ginsburg is absolutely right, that this is not an APA suit -- the word "arguably" was inserted in the normal standing test by ADAPSO, which Justice Douglas wrote. Now, if we take that and simply lift it, the first thing, the person who would get a new lawsuit, I guess, is a consumer, because the consumer could easily say, I didn't buy this product because of the false statement that the competitor of the person I would have bought from made. And, indeed, you could have very big consumers, and they could allege all kinds of injuries. And so, if I simply lift the test, I'd rather worry that I am changing the law guite radically.   But "arguably." Isn't it arguably, in part, to protect consumers?   But, now, does that -- just thinking of Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, that suggests that maybe the reasonable interest test is okay because what that's trying to do is -- you have MCDonald's that's allegedly made the false statement, and then there are a range of people in terms more or less distant in respect to being direct competitors. There is -- what you said, Burger King, direct competitor, then there are the health restaurants. Then there are -- so you need something to cut off at some point the plaintiff, who claims to be a direct competitor, but, really, he's not going to lose much money, and he's guite distant, a health restaurant in a foreign city, I mean -- you know, you see? And the reasonable interest test, I think, is trying both to get at that and also to figure out what kind of supplier you are. Are you one who falls within the scope of the false statement or the -- or are you not? You don't want the electricity company to be able to sue. So what do you think about using the reasonable interest test, but explaining it in something like the terms I've just said?   What about   If it's who's affected, who specifically are we leaving out? Look, you put in -- I don't want to leave out -- you've read all the cases. I haven't read them all. But I see that you put in -- we put in the direct competitors. They fall within it. We put in certain suppliers, those who are disparaged. We don't want the electricity company to be able to sue, according to you and the cases, and I guess we have the mirror case, which we'd put in, would be certain buyers like retailers or wholesalers and probably applying the same rule about their being mentioned in the -- in the false advertising -- or in the statement. Who have we left out? Who has been given standing in some of these cases that is left out of the description I just gave?   All right. Who do you who do you -- well, who -- who has not been left out who should have been left out? I mean, I'm trying to see -- I'm trying to see am I forgetting someone that -- that your reading of the cases suggests has been given standing.
12-895 +++$+++ 
12-9012 +++$+++    Does it make any difference? I mean, you know, it's odd to read B as applying because it says if you can't pay back the 100,000, you're -- now we're in B, and what B tells you to do is pay 100,000. Unless --   You know, I mean, that's what it says. And then -- and then you have to subtract the amount you already gave, which of course you would have to do anyway.   Return the 100,000.   No, no, forget the bats. It's just $100,000.   -- quality to this discussion which may not have contributed as much as I hoped.   But the -- the -- the point is imagine it's all money.   I mean, if it's all money, A applies, that should be the end of it. If you want to apply B, do, but it's a wash.   All right.   If you want to read it that way, it's the same problem. It seemed redundant, not circular. But you don't think it's redundant, okay. Fine.   The same problem is there. You go to 3664, and what happened was it says in 3664: Enter a restitution order, judge. And when you do that, provide for a lump-sum payment or partial payments or at specified intervals, in-kind payments, a combination of payments. It gives a judge a lot of discretion. So I imagine the judge, if he'd already given her back 20,000, would say: Now, defendant, pay her $80,000 more.   Now, the problem here is, instead of giving her the $20,000, he gave her an in-kind payment. You see, he gave her a baseball bat or in this case a house.   And so now our question is how do we value the house, and the statute doesn't tell us. Since that's so, I would have thought -- you have a very good point -- if, as here, the victim has sold the house already, well, what he got for it? That's the end of that. Unless, of course, it was an unreasonable, fraudulent, or hooked-up sale, which the defendant can point out, and the judge could -- what happens if she won't sell the house? She says: I love the bat, I love the house, I'm not selling. Then you say you have 90 days to do it --   -- or you -- or let it befall on you what help befalls. And then what you have to do is value the house if she still won't sell it.   And you have to value the bat if she still won't sell it. Do I have that right?   It was not a return.   It's in-kind property they're try to get rid of.   I see.   I think I understand now better than I did what his argument is. I see now why you want to go from A, because there are all kinds of property that could be taken, not just money.   And they say now A is out of it because he wasn't able to return it, so we're in B. And I was saying well, B requires the same thing; and you say that's right. So what's the point? Well, you say but that's how it works for other property, anyway. Now, when we get to B, we get that last phrase, and they want to make like doubly sure that -- that if in fact some of the property had already been gone back, it's going to count; and he's saying, well, it did go back. It was in-kind, the baseball bat or the house, and he's saying now, how do we value that? And you say, well, let's value it the same way as we would value in-kind property were there a list -- is that right -- of 3664? And -- and you then go on to say, the simplest thing to do is if they -- they should sell it. And then I say, okay, maybe they should, but they don't want to. And then what do we do? And the answer is call in experts like he wants. Now, have I got that right?   Thank you.   Oh, I'm not sure you'd say no part of the property they lost has been returned.   What's been happening is they've got some in-kind return.   That's true.   And when they sell and they get much more money than they otherwise thought from the house, that extra amount also counts, then, in the defendant's favor?   I followed you up through here, I think. You're into B.   He is pointing to little (ii) and you're saying that really is not relevant here because it's cash. None of the property was returned; they gave him a house, not the cash.   Well, right. What they have is the house.   Oh, I see.   And that is if they've sold it before the sentencing.   Well, let's suppose it doesn't and they still have it as of the time of sentencing, then we're over into 3(a). It's an -- 3664.   It's an in-kind payment. The judge has discretion as to how to value it. He could say, sell it within 90 days, and we will take that.   Or he could say if you don't want to do that, we call in the assessors.   You're saying because (3)(ii) applies, that when it's transformed into cash prior to the sentencing, then they have received --   -- some part of the money back --  Yes. -- and often that will work in favor of the defendant.   Sometimes, as in this case, it won't if the housing market collapses.
12-929 +++$+++        All right.     So why -- why then couldn't you go to Virginia with all these factors? I mean, maybe the jury has to take 42 visits to the bottom of an oil well shaft.     I don't know.     I mean, there could be something that would weigh in your favor. I don't know the case.     So why not go to Virginia and then file a 1404 motion? And it should reach the same result, whether you -- you go to Texas and ask to stay there or whether you go to Virginia under 1404(a) -- you win this case, let's say -- or whether you go to Virginia.     It should get to the same place, shouldn't it?       So it's actually your expense because you would have to go to Virginia and you would have to file the motion.     Maybe you can do it by mail or you'd have to -- but I don't know.       Yes.       Yes.       No, no.     They are not saying -- they said that you could make the 1404 motion in Virginia, and they think it would only be granted in an exceptional case, but that's their opinion in that, and so it should come to the same conclusion.     They aren't barring you from that on their view. But my thought is that, if all these come to the same result in the end and you just need one ruling, we have something pointing on their side -- your side, which is the Stewart footnote and the language of the - you know, the absolute language of the venue statutes, and you have something pointing in their side, which is, if we count by numbers, five circuits are in their favor and only three in yours. All right.     Help me.       That argues, then, it might be slightly against you.       The -- if, in fact, you specify a State court, if, in fact, you specify a foreign court, if, in fact, you specify arbitration, you agree, in those instances, you are going to use forum non conveniens or you are going to use 1406.     But you are saying where you specify a court in a different State, namely a Federal court in a different State, there you use 1404.       Yes, it was forum non conveniens.     Oh, you use forum non conveniens in all three?     You don't use -- I mean, they specify a State court?       They say venue is a State court -       -- use forum non conveniens in all those? Okay.     Use forum non conveniens in all those, but you use 1404 if they specify another Federal court.     That's what -- that's what -- that's what you're -       All right.       You use 12(b)(3), okay.       But my point is you're using something else, so they would say, well, let's have it the same -- you know -- okay.     I see the answer.       Forget it.       Do you know the answer - this is another -- I keep thinking they should all come to the same conclusion.     But, then, what about this point Justice Sotomayor raised?     Suppose you sue in Texas -- you know, you get there, but the contract, let's say, was a different contract from yours, but it just was made in Nevada.     Everything about this concerns Nevada.     Are they really going to use Texas law to interpret the contract rather than Nevada's? I would have thought that the choice of law question is a different question, and where you sue should be irrelevant to the choice of law question except insofar -- I don't know.     Maybe you looked -       Are -- are you finished? All right.     I'd just like, if you'd want, to give you a chance to take what I've -- I think Professor Sachs says, look, there is a way which you can both follow the statutes literally and say, well, venue is here, and also get the place to the right forum respecting the contract. Just say it is an affirmative defense, which Justice Ginsburg says the First Circuits follow this approach.     You put it in the complaint.     The answer, and once it's in the answer, the judge can put it front and center.     Indeed, in case he forgets to do that, the defendant will remind him and say, you've got to get it to the right court, and let's decide this affirmative defense thing first. And -- and now, we're back in the same place.     What do you think of that?
12-930 +++$+++    But how does -- how -- can I try an example? Because I find it easier.   All right. Imagine Steven is a citizen. His brother Charles is not. So under 4 -- and Charles has a son, Joseph, who is not. That will help you think about it. All right. So we're under F4. Steven files a petition. The beneficiary is Charles. Charles has a minor son, Joseph. Visa is granted, et cetera, for -- not visa -- you know, he's given -- everything is in order, and now, Charles has to wait about ten years or so. By the time he gets -- at the time his number becomes current -- the number becomes available for the alien, namely for Charles, at that moment, we calculate Joseph's age, and it's 24. All right. So your idea is that Charles is current. Everything is fine. He goes to the port or the office, wherever he's supposed to go, and he brings Joseph with him. At that point, Joseph, since he's no longer a child, has to come in under another category, and that category is going to be, I guess, 2B because Charles will be now an LPR, and Joseph will be unmarried over 21, right? Am I right so far?   This is an imaginary -- he spells it with a V.   Okay. Now, if I have it right --   Yes.   All right.   Okay.   Yes.   All right. Now the --   All right. But there is one thing missing. Charles has not filed a petition for Joseph. So what do we do about that?   And doesn't -- doesn't Charles, as a lawful permanent resident, have to file a piece of paper called the petition --   -- in which Joseph is named primary beneficiary?   Yes.   But there is no --there is no F2B petition because Charles never filed it.   I mean, yes; right.   That's what I want to know. You don't need --   We do all this, and --   Can I ask you a quick question --   -- about your alternative argument, with you and Justice Scalia. I take it your argument is, look at the words; the part before the comma defines a group, and that group is not in dispute. It's all the F derivatives.   All right. Then look at the first part. It says, the petition shall automatically be converted.   See, if I lose on that, then look at the second part. It says, the alien shall retain the original priority date. And you say, as to that, that has an independent life.   That's the B. So it's either A or B. And we think we win on A and B, but if not, we at least win on B. Now, has the Agency ever expressed a view in respect to whether you are right or wrong about your independent B?   No. So wouldn't the right thing to do there be, in respect to B, send it back to the Agency so that they can express a view in respect to that?
12-9490 +++$+++    My question --   Yes. But you're just saying -- I mean, but his basic point is, on the other side, is these are all variations of the famous white horse defense. You don't know the -- the white horse defense? Your Honor, my client was innocent because, at the time of the crime, he was in Yugoslavia wearing a white horse -- riding a white horse. And to prove it, I have the horse here in court. You see? I mean, you can't -- it's bootstrapping to put it more succinctly. All you know is that somebody came in and quoted -- and said there was a crime. And that's all you know. And now -- now when -- when are instances where no more than the report that it's a crime, that's reasonable suspicion. That's -- give me some other instances where the courts have upheld, well, that's enough.   I'm not saying common sense. I'm saying what the courts have held. Sorry. (Laughter.)   Not a bare--, a description that a crime is occurring, where has -- that's all, I mean, and -- and then we have a question of, well, is it in the one category or the other? Because what we have here, someone phones in and says, a crime is occurring. And -- and we know, we've corroborated the following. If a crime was occurring, he was in a position to know because he can define -- he can talk about the white horse, or he can talk about the car.   I don't know if we have to get into the drunk driving. It's 3 miles south of the Humboldt County border on -- do you know the answer to this? Is it in the record? I mean, on many sections of that road, in Mendocino County, you drive someone off the road, they are dead. I mean, there are sheer drops, and so I just wonder, if I look that up here, what's the situation where this supposedly took place?
12-96 +++$+++        What the question --       So what's the answer?     I just want to be sure that I hear your answer to an allegation, argument, an excellent argument, that's been made, or at least as I've picked up, and that is that: Yes, the problem was terrible; it has gotten a lot better; it is not to some degree cured.     All right?     I think there is a kind of common ground.     Now then the question is:     Well, what about this statute that has a certain formula?     One response is:     Yes, it has a formula that no longer has tremendous relevance in terms of its characteristic -- that is literacy tests.     But it still picked out nine States.     So, so far, you're with me. So it was rational when you continue.     You know, you don't sunset it.     You just keep it going. You're not held to quite the same criteria as if you were writing it in the first place.     But it does treat States all the same that are somewhat different. One response to that is:     Well, this is the Fifteenth Amendment, a special amendment -- you know? Maybe you're right.     Then let's proceed State by State. Let's look at it State by State.     That's what we normally do, not as applied. All right.     Now, I don't know how satisfactory that answer is. I want to know what your response is as to whether we should -- if he's right -- if he's right that there is an irrationality involved if you were writing it today in treating State A, which is not too discriminatorily worse than apparently Massachusetts or something.     All right?     So -- so if that's true, do we respond State by State?     Or is this a matter we should consider not as applied, but on its face? I just want to hear what you think about that.       Yes, but his point, I think the point is this:     If you draw a red line around the States that are in, at least some of those States have a better record than some of the States that are out.     So in 1965, well, we have history.     We have 200 years or perhaps of slavery.     We have 80 years or so of legal segregation.     We have had 41 years of this statute.     And this statute has helped, a lot. So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and says don't change horses in the middle of the stream because we still have a ways to go. Now the question is, is it rational to do that?     And people could differ on that.     And one thing to say is, of course this is aimed at States.     What do you think the Civil War was about?     Of course it was aimed at treating some States differently than others. And at some point that historical and practical sunset/no sunset, renew what worked type of justification runs out.     And the question, I think, is has it run out now? And now you tell me when does it run out? What is the standard for when it runs out?     Never? That's something you have heard people worried about. Does it never run out?     Or does it run out, but not yet? Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesn't run out now? Now, I would like you to address that.
12-98 +++$+++        How does it work?     Because I would imagine at the negotiation you have the -- the victim's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer and the tortfeasor's lawyer is interested that the bottom line number be as low as possible and the victim's number, that it be as high as possible.     And the victim's lawyer, in fact, would like as little as possible to be allocated to a source which is going to take that money away from him. So they can reach agreement.     What they will do is say 1 penny is for medical expenses and everything else is for pain and suffering, and that's very good for the victim.     And it's irrelevant to the tortfeasor. So -- so when you see that on a piece of paper, what is it you are going to do?     What kind of proceeding are you going to have?     And it's a proceeding about a proceeding.     It's a proceeding about the settlement negotiation.     What's it going to look like? What does it look like in the 16 States?     We will have a plaintiff's lawyer testify.     He will say, Your Honor, I really wanted 1 penny and only 1 penny to be allocated to pain and -- to medical expense.     And the defendant's lawyer, he's being very honest, he'll say, I didn't care; if that's what he wants, that's fine with me.       Exactly.     So what does it look like?       It's the same point.       How does it work in those States?       But I am asking the same question.     There are 16 States that have this procedure. How does it work?       I don't want to know that they have it.     I want to know how it works.     We have put the problem as to why it seems it might not work too well, and now I would like you to tell us how it really works.       Are you satisfied --       So you're -- you're satisfied with the presumption.     Is there any law here that gives you a leg-up?     I mean, is this like Chevron or Skidmore or something like that?       I know that's their position.     But my question is, does the law mean that when we decide this case, I see you have a reasonable point, they have a reasonable point, that if both points are reasonable, you get the benefit of some kind of legal presumption like Chevron, Skidmore, et cetera. Maybe you can think of another one, I don't know.     Do you or don't you?       Why isn't -- the missing part here -- maybe I just missed it -- we're interpreting a statute, and the part that trumps the lien provision is the part that says the State is entitled to payment that has been made for medical assistance for health care items -- and some other similar language is in the statute. They think their one-third rule is a good way of measuring that.     You think that the one-third rule as a rebuttable presumption is a better way of measuring that.     Now normally, or often, I would see government arguments like that where they'd say, and, by the way, we're interpreting very technical language in our statute, and Chevron and/or Skidmore means that you should give us particular weight. Is that part of your argument here, and if it isn't, why isn't it?       My impression is that you get Chevron deference on the basis of whether Congress -- and there's a lot of rules and so forth, but --       -- you haven't claimed it. And I -- so that puzzles me -- and I don't --       I'm not -- you argue what you want to argue, but I -- this is awfully technical language.     It's a minor interstitial point.
12-99 +++$+++       It's not covering.    As I understand the argument it goes back to like Jurisprudence 1.    Can you have -- the sign says no vehicles in the park.    Okay?    Does that apply to a Jeep used as a war memorial?    Answer, no.    That's been the law since the twelfth th century.    You spilled blood in the streets of Bologna, a crime, but that's not applicable to the barber. All right?    So, here, I think what they're saying is that read this statute.    You don't have to get into a metaphysical argument about things of value; rather, those things which play a central role in the organizing campaign are things that are governed by the other parts of the NLRB and to throw them in here - NLRA -- and to throw them in here is going to create a mess. Lists, access, promises to stay neutral are central to many aspects of organizing campaigns, and there are no more within this statute, this part of the thing than the Jeep on the pedestal is part of the no vehicles in the park.    Now, that's what I understand roughly their argument to be, if I've got it right.    And what is your response?      I didn't say they had a right.    They didn't say they had a right.      What they said was the kinds of property or things of value are at issue here are the kinds of things that play important roles in organizing campaigns.    And we needn't go further than that.    We don't have to talk about rights to it.    We don't have to talk about who said what to whom.    It's just that these kinds of things are organizing things, and therefore they're outside the scope --      -- just like the Jeep on the pedestal.      The question is the same, I think.    And to go back, I thought the most clear statement of your view was when you said to Justice Scalia that if we don't accept your interpretation, there's a hole in the statute.      In fact, I think you said a big hole.     All right.    Now -     I get the point.     I'm focusing on the hole.     Now, I thought the area that you're calling a hole is an area where the National Labor Relations Act gives the National Labor Relations Board all kinds of authority to set rules and to say what is an appropriate practice and not.    Am I right about that?      All right.    If the answer is yes, and I'm sure there's some qualification, but if the heart of the answer is yes, then it's the contrary that creates the hole, because if we throw those things which are central to the NLRA's regulatory power into this particular provision, the NLRA loses the power to say when they're okay, when they're not okay, to make a thousand qualifications. Hence, the NLRA's regulatory provisions and this case are the Jeep on the pedestal or the barber in the street.    Even though I have to tell you, in Bologna in the 18th century, despite the exception of the eighth century, it did not mention barbers specifically in the statute.    They had to be read in by the courts. (Laughter.)      Yes.
12-992 +++$+++    The -- in my own mind, what matters is you have to have one clear rule, one way or the other.   And -- fine. Okay. Both agree that's right, I think. The -- so the First Circuit's approach is less referable. Which should it be? Well, go back to Justice Alito's question. What are ordinary lawyers going to think? What they normally think now, I guess, is this: There's a piece of paper separate. It's called a judgment. Counsel, one set goes into the file. You have 30 days, if you're not going to change that judgment, and the fact that you want costs doesn't make a difference. Now, what you want us to say is the fact that you want costs sometimes makes a difference. It makes a difference when it's nonstatutory. I grant you, that's fairly simple. But isn't it better to tell the lawyers -- I mean, I think that's what they would say -- it's better to tell the lawyers, look, counsel, a piece of paper is there, you have 30 days, and try to minimize the exceptions to that.   I believe this rule was cost of litigation.   In this case, it's lawyers, but it's going to treat the same -- experts, such as 1988, experts, real estate, all those things the lawyer simply thinks, costs of litigation, if it's cost of litigation I want, that doesn't make a difference, I better file it.
13-115 +++$+++    The question is, what is -- there are so many different theories floating in this case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what you want me to decide -- on what theory you want me to decide. Is your allegation that the Secret Service agents were motivated in part by security reasons and in part by bad -- what you would say, bad viewpoint reasons? Or is your theory the Secret Service was motivated only by viewpoint and zero by security?   It's the latter. Okay. So then if it is the latter, I think you're hearing the government saying, yes, that is clearly established, that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore, you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what we both just agreed you wanted to say.   All right. Maybe they didn't and I have to decide that.   Okay. Then I would have to decide is it the case that if the Secret -- if the Secret Service was motivated not at all by security and a 100 percent by viewpoint, does that state a claim? Now, we'd running into the Bivens problem, et cetera. But leaving all that out of it, the next question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet, which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do than state a claim? 5 years ago, I would have thought nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district court could deal with that. They would deal with it by giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum, or 10 minutes plus summary judgment. Or have you really certified this under Rule 11? Are you kidding? Be careful. Or you know, they have five or six different weapons. Now, that is what you're arguing, I think. But then along comes Iqbal.   Now, it's a long way of focusing you on that question.   You say in your complaint, "The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service agents told Tao and the police defendants that the reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was that they did not want anyone within handgun or explosive range of the President. To the extent the agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion was false, and the Defendant Tao and police defendants knew or should have known that it was false." So you think it's false. They think it's true. That's called a dispute of fact. And the normal circumstance is that the judge has various weapons at his disposal, legal weapons, to try to prevent -- to try to prevent court's time being wasted, officer's time being wasted and other's time being wasted on factual allegations that are unlikely to be true. That was true before Iqbal as well as after. That's your position, isn't it?   All right. How do you do that? Because I want to follow up on just what the Chief Justice said. Imagine that what he just said is the real case. You have a client, imagine, who's quite sincere, absolutely sincere, and really feels he was very badly treated, and you can sign a Rule 11 statement, but suppose that the facts are just what he said. Then suppose that Iqbal were not the law. Forget Iqbal for the moment. Now, you've got my hypothetical.   All right. What weapons does the district judge have, which I have so blithely been assuming, to prevent a waste of time by the Secret Service, a demoralization of the service leaning in the direction of being overly careful and therefore risking the President. What procedural weapons does the present law, absent Iqbal, give him to dispose of a case quickly without disturbance if the true facts are what the Chief Justice said?   But what about -- what about the --
13-132 +++$+++    Okay, so what's your rule? So there are three possibilities: Possibility one, smartphone, no, get a warrant, unless exigent circumstances. Possibility two, yes, it's just like a piece of paper that you find in his pocket. Or possibility three, sometimes yes, sometimes no. All right, which of those three is yours?   No, no, I mean of my three choices. I mean, call the first choice never except exigent without a warrant; always, you don't need a warrant; or three, somewhere in between. Which of the three choices is yours?   In between. Okay. Now we're in between. Then I get to my follow up question.   My follow up question is, please tell me what your in-between rule is?   Your rule is sometimes. So I say: Sometimes; what's that? And you say if it is the kind of thing that the police could have searched for if it wasn't on the computer, then they can search for it on the computer. Now, since they can search for everything in your pockets before when it isn't the computer, then why isn't yours everything? I mean, by the way, they don't know whether a call is or is not going to turn out to be evidence when it's in your trash box if that's, or wherever you put it, I don't know. They don't know that 'til they read it. So I guess what you're saying is I thought it was category two, sometimes, but really it's category three, always. Now, why am I wrong?   That gives you time to think.   By the way, GPS information, I don't want to admit it, but my wife might put a little note in my pocket". Steven, remember, turn right at the third stoplight, proceed three blocks forward. Of course you could have looked at information that showed where you had been and where you were going as long as it was on paper. Now it's in a GPS. So how does your rule help?   Or how -- there's an analogue with photos. The arrested person has photos, pre-digital age. Of course you can look at them. On the phone there are photos. Absolutely analogous, except there are 10,000. It's indeed his entire life history in photos.   On your rule, can the policeman look at the photos by analogue or not, because there are 10,000. Okay? What's the answer?   What we have is, by the way -- you understand where I'm going. I think there are very, very few things that you cannot find in analogue to in pre-digital age searches. And the problem in almost all instances is quantity and how far afield you're likely to be going. Do I accept your rule?   We've had a couple of States where this has been so, where they've had a rule that you can't search, for Michigan, I think, and Vermont. And are there any instance out of those States where these scenarios have taken place?   You don't know of any. I take it you don't know.   All right. So isn't this a problem that might be postponed because we have warring technologies, et cetera? And is it -- you're saying now we should allow searches of all cell phones because there might be a technology that hasn't yet in fact been used in any of the States that have this rule. That sounds a little hypothetical. I'm not quite sure how to handle it.
13-193 +++$+++    Why? Why?   Why can't a person say, you know, there are things I want to say politically, and the Constitution says that the State does not have the right to abridge my speech, and I intend to say them. And if I say them, there's a serious risk that I will be had up before a commission and could be fined. What's the harm? I can't speak. That's the harm. Right? So why isn't that end of the matter?   Why shouldn't it be the harm? That is, whatever -- has any case said when somebody says, we're going to take an extreme, you want to speak in a campaign, and we have a law here that if you do we will throw you in jail and you really do want to speak and the law really does prevent you from speaking, why shouldn't that be the end of it?   Well, I'm saying is there a statute -- not a statute. Is there a case which says the little syllogism I just went through is not the law of the United States? Now, there may be. That's why I asked the guestion.   What would you say as a lawyer -- you're now a lawyer for the Commission. You understand it better than I. I'm just making up an example. Do you think they'd prosecute this or not? Somebody walks in front of the House of a political opponent has a big sign that says murderer. Now when asked, you said but he voted for legislation that led to the death of many cats. Would they prosecute that or not?   I just want to know your opinion as the lawyer for the Commission, do you think that's going to be prosecuted or not?   Probably not.   But why did they prosecute this here?   I mean, we've heard in other cases, you know, just recently, a very major case, where people really believed about the same thing and they were sincere in their beliefs. So why --   I had a reason for asking what sounds like a silly hypothetical, but a possible one. We understand how people take different views on that. And then you have a hard time, it seems to me, distinguishing this case from that one in terms of their exercising their authority. And so at least it must raise a guestion, a First Amendment guestion on the merits. It seems pretty serious. So if you lose on this procedural matter, how guickly can you get this decided? I mean, there are elections coming up. People would like to know. They want to know what they're supposed to say. And how long is all this procedural skirmishing going to take, which in and of itself is an obstacle to what they might say in the next election?   So  so I'm saying that these seem to be preliminary questions on a matter in respect to which there seems serious doubt. I'll repeat myself. The elections are coming up. And people have to know what they're supposed to say and what they can say and what they can't. So how do we get this decided?   It is suggesting that. I agree, it is suggesting that.   Well, I would say one of the purposes of standing is to allow people who are really going to be hurt to be able to be heard in court. Well, of course, if they're not going to be hurt, there's no reason. And what the merits discussion is designed to suggest is that there are real people who would really like to speak in an election campaign. And if they feel they can't, they are really being hurt. That's what the other side is arguing. And I've listened to the argument. I'm curious as to the practicalities. If they're right, when is this going to be heard and decided in your opinion?   You tell me how to do it.   I'm saying if you were to lose on the --
13-298 +++$+++    Can I ask you at some point, not necessarily this second, to say in my -- this is just -- you know, you have an opinion for a court. Different judges can have different interpretations. All you're getting is mine, okay? But I think it's pretty easy to say that Archimedes can't just go to a boat builder and say, apply my idea. All right. Everybody agrees with that. But now we try to take that word "apply" and give content to it. And what I suspect, in my opinion, Mayo did and Bilski and the other cases is sketch an outer shell of the content, hoping that the experts, you and the other lawyers and the -- the circuit court, could fill in a little better than we had done the content of that shell. So, so far you're saying, well, this is close enough to Archimedes saying "apply it" that we needn't go further. Now, will you at some point in the next few minutes give me your impression of, if it were necessary to go further, what would the right words or example be?   Yeah, but the trouble with that particular test is, as I think partly the Chief Justice said, how long, et cetera, and then add to that, though you could do it without a computer, what happens at the end of the line is the automobile engine goes off or it begins to sputter or it turns left. You see, it's possible to take Archimedes or King -- -- you know, I use that example purposely to call attention to the problem. You can take those things, and you're not just saying apply it, and you're not even just saying -- you are saying use the computer, but at the end of the road, something physical in the world changes and everybody would say, now, that's -- that falls within, I mean, probably, I mean, my hesitation shows I'm looking for the right words.   Could -- could -- could you go on with that because you were just getting to the point where I think you say a computer improvement that, in fact, leads to an improvement in harvesting cotton is an improvement through a computer of technology, so it qualifies. But then I think you were going to say, or I got this also from the brief, a computer improvement that leads to an improvement in the methods of selling bonds over the telephone is not an improvement in technology reached by the computer. Am I right about the distinction you're making?   What is your view? Yeah, what is -- how do we deal with just that problem?   Yes.   We've got that. Yes, yes. We got the computer. But then it doesn't improve the computer, but rather, it improves through the computer the harvesting of cotton. Now you've got it in what you said was your second category, which is an improvement through the computer of a technology. And I thought in your brief you were distinguishing an improvement through the computer of a human activity that is not a technology and, in particular, to pick an example of that, something in finance or something in business. Now, am I right about the distinction you're making?   If I'm not right, what is the distinction?   And how is that justified?   That -- that is Judge Dyk in -- in Bilski in the Federal circuit, four people sort of picked it up maybe, five didn't pick it up. Would you say a few words about it?
13-299 +++$+++    You don't? Because I suppose one reason I thought you might want to do it is because in (d) there are a list of, "the following property may be exempted," and then we have 12 items. And the first item, number one, the debtor's aggregate interest; two, the debtor's interest in the motor vehicle; three, the debtor's interest in furnishings; four, the debtor's interest in jewelry; five, the debtor's interest in 1225; six, the debtor's aggregate interest in; seven, et cetera, life insurance owned by the debtor; eight, the debtor's interest; nine, prescribed health. You know, I can go through those.   And then we get to number 12. And Number 12, oddly enough, just says retirement funds.   It doesn't say anything about the debtor. And moreover, it has four paragraphs earlier in which it describes retirement funds in which it says nothing about the debtor. And then there are three paragraphs prior to that in which, once again, we're talking about State exemptions, we talk about the debtor's interest in real property, et cetera, and then we say retirement funds.   So I guess that's the reason you didn't want to say it means the debtor's retirement funds.   No, I see your argument here. I -- I just thought there is no easy answer, one way or the other, because this is a case where common sense, frankly, in my case doesn't get me anywhere, and that's why --   And I sort of looked at the statute and the statute kept talking about the debtor's interest in everything else and then we get to this one, it says retirement funds.   So I thought it means retirement funds.   You don't have to, on my account, go into this, because I was just giving that as an example of why I find this not an easy case. I don't see an easy answer to it. That's all. I -- I understand your point and that's why you're making a different point of what retirement funds are.   Oh, no, but they were.   And so a retirement fund is a fund that was set aside for retirement. At some point in time, someone set aside for retirement. Now the question is, they were set aside for retirement and no one denies that and so --   -- do they change their nature because a different person now owns the fund?   Now, if you were talking about pearl earrings, you would say they stay pearl earrings no matter who retains it. If you say retirement funds, you say, but they were retirement funds. When did they change their nature? And at that point you have to make your argument, which I think is a more -- is complicated, but perhaps I understand and he makes his argument and says, let's keep this simple. They were retirement funds, period, okay? And that -- that's where I am, if you want to know. I mean, that's -- I have to figure it out.   The problem, I mean basically, is that you're not going to make us go into subjective intent. You don't want us to.   That leaves somebody out. I'm never going to retire says X, but when I'm 70- 1/2 I'm going to take that money out of there and buy my own airplane.   Okay. That's beside the point.   While the daughter who inherited thinks this is fabulous, I'm going to keep it through my retirement, at least I'll be able to -- that's out of the question. Okay. Once you put that aside, then you're falling back on, well, are they the retirement funds of the debtor? And it's pretty hard to do that -- that's what the court of appeals did -- because of the language of the rest of the statute. And now, once you're past those two points, then where are we? Because now it seems what we are doing is just drawing a line that's somewhat arbitrary. Makes some sense policy-wise, but it just seems like a line that says: Inherited ones, no; not inherited ones, yes.   You have some theory behind that, but how can I do more than that?   I don't think it's arbitrary, either. But I mean the trouble is what is it resting on? If it's not resting on subjective intent, it's not resting on these words refer to the funds of the debtor, what does it rest on?
13-301 +++$+++    No, I think she said it was the possibility. I asked her. If there were others, she didn't say any others.   But there will be an argument whether they can or can't.
13-316 +++$+++    If I have it right, I just want to be sure, in my Crook case, which you may or may not remember, you're reading the word "obtained" to mean whoever knowingly executes a scheme or artifice to obtain. It doesn't mean for him to obtain. It means for anybody to obtain. That's how you read it.   And that has been -- and that has been pretty much the universal --   Okay, okay, okay. You don't have to argue it. I just wanted to know now --   Fine, fine, fine, then is the way you see the statute.   That Mr. Crook goes to Mr. Smith and says, dear Mr. Smith, here is my check for $50,000, knowing he only has $3 in his account. All right. Now, case one is Mr. Smith, not too bright, gives him $500. Now, he might, Mr. Crook, think that Smith will then go and present the check to the bank and maybe get some money. In that case, he has violated this, in your view, because Mr. Smith obtained money from the bank and that was part of Mr. Crook's idea as what was likely to happen whether he'd wanted it to or not.   All right.   There's also Justice Scalia's point which is an important matter to me, and that is that there also is the case when Mr. Crook doesn't know how the banking system works at all and he has no idea that the bank will, in fact, give any money or whether it will give any money. Those are the two cases.   It doesn't need a response. All I want is explanation.   Answer -- what's the answer to Justice Sotomayor's question?   Mr.Crook is not too bright and Mr. Crook doesn't even know what a bank is and all he knows is he's can get $500 from this other not-genius Mr. Smith. So he does not care about banks. He doesn't know how they work. He has no idea if they pay or don't pay. What's the result?
13-317 +++$+++    Yes, that's -- that's what's nagging at me that I don't fully understand. It may be elementary, but if we had a case where all the plaintiffs had, in fact, and every one in the class had bought on the New York Stock Exchange at such and such a period, then I guess in principle neither would be appropriate for the classification stage -- certification stage.   Neither would be appropriate for the certification stage. You wouldn't have to prove efficient markets; all you would have to do is allege them; because, after all, if they do exist then the reliance element is proved subject to rebuttal; and if the rebuttal wins, it's not. And that's not a question if it's all in common, it's all in common. That's -- that's the conceptual point I haven't quite understood.   Why not?   If we had a class, they all conceded that they bought it on the market at the same time, had no information, then it would go to the later stage?
13-339 +++$+++  
13-354 +++$+++    I just want -- before you get to this point, and my question reflects no point of view at all on my behalf. I just -- but I took Mr. Clement, one of his points, which I thought was an important one. He says there are some people here who strongly object to helping with abortions which include abortifacient contraceptives. Everybody says, yes, they do object to that and that's sincere. So he's not saying this, but I might. But there is a compelling interest in women's health and in the health of the family, and they're not having a religious objection to taking it. And so the government has said provide it. Then he says, but there is a less restrictive way, and the less restrictive way is the government pays for it. Says it wouldn't cost much. You'd have to have another piece of paper that would go to the insurance company that would say, insofar as your employer has a sincere objection against paying this, the government will pay for it. Now, what I want to hear, and this is not coming from any point of view, I want to hear your precise answer to that kind of argument.   I'm not interested in whether they made the argument sooner or later. What I want to hear from you is I want to hear -- and it's not -- you've thought about this. I want to hear your answer to that kind of argument.   I want to be sure you have a chance to give it.   Still, I want to get -- press this a little further, and I don't want you simply to just agree with what I'm about to say.   No, I mean -- I mean, after all, somebody, a taxpayer, might say, "I don't want to pay for this small war." And it would be a religious ground, and it would be very, very little money, in fact, that you take from him. Or the church might say, "I want a Sunday morning reduction in the cost of municipal parking." And by the way, that will not only not cost the government anything, they'll make money because nobody parks there on Sunday, particularly with this high a fee. Now, I'm thinking of -- I'm trying to figure out where this case fits in that spectrum because I think the answer to the first two questions is no. And I know, so you're just going to agree, and that's what I don't want. I want to understand your thinking on that.   I mean, the point that Justice Alito was making is that -- take five Jewish or Muslim butchers and what you're saying to them is if they choose to work under the corporate form, which is viewed universally, you have to give up on that form the Freedom of Exercise Clause that you'd otherwise have. Now, looked at that way, I don't think it matters whether they call themselves a corporation or whether they call themselves individuals. I mean, I think that's the question you're being asked, and I need to know what your response is to it.
13-369 +++$+++    I'm a little confused here. Imagine there are two kinds of electrodes, a blue one and a green one, and you have to have a blue one and green one on left hand and a blue one and green one on right hand. And now, you cannot let them touch. The blue can't touch the green. I got that. And suppose on your left hand you put the blue one here and the green one there. And in the right hand, you put the blue in here and the green in here. See, they're not touching, but they're different distances from each other in the two hands. Does it work or not?   Look, look. This is like that one hand.   And this one's like the other hand. Okay? So does it work or not?   All right. Look, on the green one is two inches -- the space between the green one and the right one is like a half inch for the left hand, and it's like one inch for the right hand. Okay? Does it work?   It was asked in a pretty roundabout way. (Laughter.)   Then did he know that they had to be -- like if you put it two inches across here, so there are two inches between them, and over here it's like a half inch between them, did he know it did work or did he know it didn't work?   He knew if it worked, but I want to know if it does work.   Okay. Now, as soon as you say that, that's his point. His point is that when I read it -- I guess that's the point that's being made. When I read it, it just seems to me that the green one can't touch the blue one, and the whole thing has to fit within your hand, so each of them catches a finger. And he's saying that isn't good enough. That doesn't work. They have to be the same distance. And what that distance is, this document doesn't tell us. And it doesn't even tell us they have to be the same distance. So therefore, since it doesn't tell us that, it's ambiguous. Is that the correct argument? All right. We think it's the correct argument. So now, what's your answer?   It doesn't even say that. It doesn't even say that. It doesn't say go experiment whether somebody with great big fingers on one hand and tiny little fingers on the other hand --   What worries me about that, which is certainly attractive, what you just say, is that lawyers will come up with all kinds of experts, you know. And quite often, if this situation ever arises, and I don't know if it really ever does, it could reflect a difference of opinion among scientists. I mean, you could have those who followed the phlogiston theory of fire. You could have those who follow the oxygen theory of fire. All we have to do is update that, and you could find different experts who would have different opinions while all agreeing that it is absolutely clear. I doubt that the Patent Office will very often find that problem arising. And if it does, why not just say, forget about it? As long as you can say reasonable experts can clearly -- you know, what you just said -- that's the end of it. And we'll tell you what to do later, when we really find the problem or you tell us what to do. I mean, I'm having a problem about it, and I'm explaining what my problem was.   Can't we just stop there? I mean, do we really have to go into this theoretical dispute between the two scientists, who have opposite theories of --
13-461 +++$+++    The answer is very significant. And the reason it's very significant is because what the local antenna person doesn't do but you apparently could do, even if you don't, is with the same kind of device pick up every television signal in the world and send it, almost, and send it into a person's computer. And that sounds so much like what a CATV system does or what a satellite system does that it looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that's imposed upon them. That's what disturbs everyone. And then what disturbs me on the other side is I don't understand what the decision for you or against you when I write it is going to do to all kinds of other technologies. I've read the briefs fairly carefully, and I'm still uncertain that I understand it well enough. That isn't your problem, but it might turn out to be. (Laughter.)   Would you -- would you explain in a sentence or two, which will sound as if I'm favoring with you, but I want them to have a chance to reply, the thing that frightened me somewhat in your brief was, I think, of the cloud storing everybody's music. Vast amounts of music. And now they then send it down, perhaps to a million people at a time, who want to all hear the same song. Now, what you said was, if I understood it, but explain it if it is, that there is a provision of the copyright law that says when that happens, it's subject to a compulsory license. And if it's subject to a compulsory license, then, of course, people can get it and it's paid for by somebody. But if we decide with them, there'd be a different provision that would come into play, namely, the performance, and it wouldn't be subject to the compulsory license. There's no point telling me I'm right if I'm wrong. What I want to know is am I -- have I got your argument correctly? And if not, what is it?   It's not my argument. It's a parody perhaps, or an incorrect version of your argument.   All right. So that would be the same then, it isn't going to be a problem.   But it should work out in a parallel way. That is, when I look at the program, I am making a copy of the program and, therefore, I'm violating the nonexclusive right -- the exclusive right to copy. Now, if that's fair use and therefore, I can do it, it should also be fair use if exactly the same thing happens but it comes from a cloud.   115(c)(3).
13-483 +++$+++ 
132, Orig. +++$+++          Okay.       I see.     So --         So I was thinking of this, is:   What we have are a group of States, each of whom feels it's necessary to build a cholera plant.                    And they know that the cholera plant will be hated by everybody in their State, but it's necessary.                    So they each say:     We ll undertake it, okay?              But the deal is you do, too.     Now, that's their basic deal. I don't know that they ever would have entered into this as part of the basic deal that State A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but when it's State A's turn, they run away.                 Well, that's the deal.     They can run away.              But in addition, take $80 million?           Okay.        That's where we are back with the Chief's question. Now, I don't know whether it is an appropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep the 80 million as well as running away.              But it seems to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they said it was an appropriate step.              They foresaw you would take the 80 million, never give it back, at least. But the Commission thinks it isn't.             And the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the Commission.     And what the Commission says in the language that I quoted is that the Commission is the judge of the members' compliance with the requirements of this contract.              So when I read that, I think:   Surely, he should have paid some attention to the fact that the Commission thought that what was keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step. Now, there we are.             That's my question. And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of States relating to the enactment of this contract -- compact.   And I don't know that you read "enactment" so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how you adopt it.     There might be a whole lot of laws.              I guess you pay attention to all of them.               So I don't see what the last phrase has to do with it.               But anyway, that's my basic question in the case.          So, in your opinion, the Commission is not the judge of anything other than membership?          So, therefore, the six pages or so of this compact that has to do with a lot of detailed issues that might appear before the Commission -- it is not the judge of whether there is compliance with those issues --   -- because this concerns only membership?          Well, why -- why would anyone stay in the contract?             I take it that your point, which is an awfully good one, is that this compact was designed, like others, to solve a political problem. It's necessary for the country to store low-level radioactive waste, necessary for health and safety, but because of the politics and people's understanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so, now, the States have formed a series of compacts. And we are told, in an amicus brief, that, if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to take advantage of another State's having done so for years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot, it will be impossible for many other States to resist that same route. And that will be the end of compacts through the United States, and what we will have is low-level waste without storage.          That's argument, roughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case, and I would like to know your opinion.        But what -- what -- you just said -- I may not have misunderstood, but I thought you said, in response to Justice Scalia, that, during 1997 and '98, when he said why didn't you take appropriate steps, that you said you didn't do anything, and that was the appropriate step; is that right?     If you -- if you said that --        If I heard you correctly. All right.     But then it shows in the -- in the Special Master's report that, during that time, you received from the Commission funds over $7 million. So you may not have done anything, but you did take $7 million at that time from other people.         And so they are saying, fine, if you didn't take any anything, didn't do anything, and that was the appropriate step, why isn't it the appropriate step now to give us the 7 million back?        You say -- well -- in other words, North Carolina's money in '97 and '98, which was $4 million, went to pay for current expenditures during North -- during that year, '97/'98, but the Commission's money, which amounted to $7 million in that time, was not spent on current things?     It was rather a payment for things done in the past? This sounds not -- I'm not -- I mean, that's possible, but I just don't recall anything that suggests that.        So the whole formula --        -- and the whole --
134 ORIG +++$+++  
137, Orig. +++$+++        But you -- obviously, you're saying -       You read it with a different emphasis.     Justice Scalia read it with - beneficial use is that use by which the water supply of a drainage basin "is depleted" when usefully employed by the activities of man. And you read it:     By which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted "when usefully employed by the activities of man."     So that it is a definition in respect to how you use it, not amounts. But if you emphasize the word "depleted," it could be read as referring to amounts, and not quality of use, not nature.     And -       Yes, well -       And there's no way to read this contract -- this compact so it's share and share alike?       There's no fair way to decide this case?       So your linguistic argument is they didn't use the word "diversion" because they didn't want to throw the mill race example into the definition -       Yes, they didn't want mill races in the definition, so they purposely didn't use the word "diversion"; that's why they used the word "depletion."       Correct, and they wanted that.
138, Orig. +++$+++            What is the percentage, approximately, of the river that flows into South Carolina that the three intervenors account for?           Well, about.           Out of what?       Out of what?          Well, I mean, do they account for, like -- there s a certain amount of water in dispute.     There are some people who want to intervene.     Are the people who intervene -- do they account more like 1 percent of all the water that s in dispute, or do they account for more like 50 percent? That seems like a pretty relevant question to me.              You must have some idea.          Well, significant   is that more like 3 percent, or is it more like 90 percent? I mean, nobody has ever bothered to look at that in this whole case?          Oh, that's -- I agree. That's a good point, but -- so what percentage if  - what percentage of the interbasin transfers do they account for?              Okay.          So insofar -- so insofar as what they are after is interbasin transfers, just what Justice Scalia said is correct.              These are the interbasin transfer people.             That s helpful.            Well, how is just this involved?    Is there -- because I am amazed that this is now coming to me for the first time.                 All this case is about is interbasin transfers and that you account for 100 percent of them, you three.              Is that -- is that right?   Because I suspect in, like, 5 minutes, somebody might tell me it's not right. (Laughter.)            I -- that's not my question.               I want -- I m trying  - look, if Alaska sued California and the complaint was we want San Francisco back, San Francisco might have a right to intervene.     But if it was about California generally, maybe they wouldn't. So what I want to know is, what's the water that is at issue in this complaint and how much of the water that is at issue in this complaint do the three intervenors account for?        That seems like a fairly simple empirical question.             That's what I'm trying to get the answer to.
11-398 +++$+++        It basically, basically the difference -- of language is relevant.     There are a lot of relevant things.     But one thing that's relevant in my mind is that taxes are, for better or for worse, the life's blood of government.       Copyright exists regardless.     So, the reasoning isn't there.       The language -- you're -- I see the similarity of language.     I've got that.     But it's the reasoning, the sort of underlying reason for not wanting a waiver here that is -- has a significant role in my mind of finding that it is jurisdictional. Plus the fact that we've said it nonstop since that Northrop or whatever that other case is.       That's fine.     I just asked in case you wanted to answer the policy.
11-400 +++$+++        Just before you leave that, I'd appreciate it if you would expand a little bit on the answer to Justice Kagan's question for the reason, when I read the cutoff statute, which as I said has been there since 1965 unchanged, it does refer to the Secretary's discretion to keep the funding, insofar as the funding has no relationship to the failure to comply with the condition. And as I read that, that gives the Secretary the authority to cut off all the money that the States' refusal to accept the condition means they shouldn't have.     But nothing there says they can go beyond that and cut off unrelated money.     Now, there is a sentence, says maybe they could do that.     But I thought they had to exercise that within reason.       I don't know when it be reasonable.     So, you've looked into it, and that's what I want to know.       Is there -- I could find no instance where they went beyond the funds that were related to the thing that the State refused to do or things affected by that.     I would like you to tell me, when you looked into it, that what I thought of in this isolation chamber here is actually true.     Or whether they have gone around threatening people that we will cut off totally unrelated funds. What is the situation?       I don't know if that's so. And all I asked in my question was I didn't ask you to commit the Secretary to anything.    I wanted to know what the facts are.       I wanted to know what you found in researching this case.    I wanted you, in other words, to answer the question the Chief Justice has:    Is it a common thing that that happens, that this unrelated threat is made?    Or isn't it?      You're not privy to conversations.       Why is it different?     Why is it different?     I mean, I thought it might be very unlikely a State would ever say that the government -- Federal Government would say here's a condition that you have to have a certain kind of eyeglasses for people who don't see.     And, by the way, if you don't do that, we'll take away $42 billion of funding.     Okay? I thought such a thing would not happen. And I thought if it tried to happen, that it's governed by the APA, and the person with the eyeglasses would say it's arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion.     And that's so even though the statute says it's in the discretion of the Secretary. But Mr. -- your colleague and brother says no, I'm wrong about the law there, and, moreover, they would do it.     That's what I'm hearing now.       That they would do it, and they do do it, and -- et cetera.     So, I'd like a little clarification.       What's making you reluctant?       Yes, I do.
12-1226 +++$+++    But you don't know where the -- I would like just to go back on this very point to what Justice Kagan said. Now, the MCDonnell Douglas test, I think, should come in somewhere. That is the -- the woman shows that, I'm pregnant, I couldn't lift, I wasn't paid anything, and other people who had comparable inabilities were paid. And so we get to, was I gualified like they are? And now a distinction is being made. The employer says, no, you are not because you didn't drive over the mountain pass. Or, no, you are not because you got it off the job. And then we have to decide is that a pretext? Is it legitimate? And where they are giving it to everybody else and there are very few, it doesn't sound too legitimate. But that test must come in.   And so -- and so how does it and does it matter if we put it under the first so-called whatever, you know, intentional as opposed to disparate impact? Will we muck up the law were we to say it goes in that part rather than the other part or both parts?   But why not if it goes under disparate treatment?   Why not? Because, of course, the employer will always have a facially neutral policy. It just turns out that this facially neutral policy happens to hit the pregnant women and four other people.   And I mean, that -- that's the kind of thing that we're trying to stop in this statute. So -- so why not bring it in there, in the disparate treatment part as you say?   Yes.   So why shouldn't there be a trial on that or further proceedings? If it turns out that they're right that there were four people who weren't pregnant, and that's all, who didn't get the benefits, that's pretty strong evidence that the employer is discriminating. If there were 400,000 people who got the thing off the job and there were only, like, 19 people on the job who got the benefit, well, then you have a better case. So why don't we have to look at the facts?
12-1497 +++$+++    Is that about fraud?   I think the point --   I think -- I think the point these people are trying to make, perhaps --   -- is that that provision you've read provides for a civil action by the attorney general --   -- against a person who has committed an offense. What offense? An offense elsewhere defined in 18. Is that offense defined elsewhere criminal or civil? It is criminal.   That's the point, I think.   I know you disagree, but -- so let's turn to the other offense it cross-references --   -- and why don't you read that.   I've got the language of that.   I -- I agree with -- the word "offense" appears and it provides for a civil action. What I wonder is, when you turn to the particular provisions that do that, and look at the word "offense," is that word "offense" in those civil remedy provisions referring to a civil or criminal behavior?   To civil you say. So let's read --   And the word "offense" refers to the civil behavior.   Okay. Good. Read me the example because I must have missed it.   Is there -- is there a provision that uses the word "offense" even though it may be civil, where that word "offense" in that provision refers to something other than a criminal offense?   Every use of the word "offense" in Title 18 is in reference to a criminal offense.   But the answer to my guestion was yes?   Yes.
126, Orig. +++$+++    How does it work? I mean, this can't be the first time this came up. The contract, to me, is more like the antigue dealer and the customer promised to buy all of the Ming vases, and they'll determine if it's a Ming vase according to a technical method in the appendix, and the appendix happens to throw in not only the Ming vases but all the Tang vases and nobody thinks they should get the Tang vases. Okay. So that's the deal. So we go to the judge. And one way is reformation, but they say no, no, it's a contracts deal, it's all closed, you can't -- another way is rescission. Okay. Rescission, apparently nobody wants that. Because there was a mutual mistake, they rescind. Okay. You must have read -- there must be thousands of cases with algorithms. I mean, we live in a world where there are algorithms, there are computers, there is the Internet, there is this formula, that formula. It can't be the first time that somebody in a contract has made a technical mistake about the algorithm to be used for determining the object. So what do the contract courts do?   This is a slightly extraneous guestion but I'm curious in light of the -- part of this argument is about money. We can deal with that. But this part about the accounting, my instinct is that farmers and others who use the water have to know, and it hurts them when another 5 years goes by without anybody understanding what the procedure is. Both sides say that, you know, you should be able to work this out. It looks as if what you're facing are nine people -- I'm not speaking for the other eight I'm just speaking for myself -- who couldn't know less about it, all right, and we're supposed to decide whether some system here is going to work or not. And that can be another 5 years. Is there any chance that you all could work this out?   That's true, but they've made an argument that if you look at the contract law, you will see that rescission is the normal remedy for this kind of a mistake rather than reformation. And you apparently, at some level, agree with that because what you've pointed to are not normal contract cases. You pointed to two cases involving State compacts in this Court. And suppose that I think that that is actually a difficult guestion.
13-1010 +++$+++    Isn't that what Justice Scalia believes? I tend to agree with him. He said -- he said the other side is arguing the same thing, and -- and says since both sides want to argue the same thing, maybe we can just agree with them. (Laughter.)
13-1019 +++$+++    You know, this is a -- this is Hornbook law, I thought, use it till this point. But everything is reviewable. Now, that isn't quite true, but if you want to apply for a visa at a foreign embassy abroad, at our embassy is not reviewable. Okay, and maybe there's a military thing, but even the -- even the -- even the things like the Panama Canal toll, where they said it wasn't reviewable, Davis says it should have been. And the answer to your problem is it's not --it's not reviewable, the three cases or so where we said it wasn't. The answer is the agency has broad discretion, and because they have such broad discretion, the court can review it, but unless it's very unusual, they have to decide for the agency. Now, eight circuits have roughly followed that; three, more detailed than others. And I haven't found anything in your brief that says in the last 40 years, the EEOC has, as a result, found its functioning seriously hampered. And -- and so why -- what's -- that's why I'm -- I'm wondering.   So that's what -- that's where we are. I'm trying to -- what I'd like you to do, I'm going to get you to focus on just what you want to say, that the framework in which I'm putting it is of course there is review, but of course at the same time, there is very broad discretion given to the EEOC. So courts do not intervene; be careful, it's an unusual case. Now, that's what you want. Now, I want to know how to say that. And the case that comes to me the closest was the case that we had with the IRS where, in fact, of course the IRS says, we're in good faith. And the court says, that's just fine, unless of course there is an unusual situation. Now, one can write those words. In that kind of opinion, I've noticed it works best if you also give an example through the use of the case. Now, that's where I am. And since I think that's what you want -- something like that is what you want to argue, I'm asking you for help how to write that.   What about that analogy with that IRS case?   So could we copy that, you know, just copy that, making appropriate changes, and say, look, Judge, you have to see -- you have their affidavit. As long as you think that affidavit really was the bottom line, we could conciliate it unless you have good reason to think that isn't so. That's the end of it, unless there is evidence of an abuse of process that we'll allow you to go further because conciliation, mediation is really a matter that Congress intended to leave up to the agency. And even what sounds minimal, minimal, at least the agency has to make an offer. Maybe they don't. Maybe the best way to conciliate it is you sit there and say, well, you know, that can be in some circumstance. So you -- you -- what about some? Is that not possible?   What?   I  I'm not a conciliator or a mediator, but those I know who are might be able to create such rules. On the other hand, they might not. It might be that conciliation is a process that in part is intuitive. So to require the agency to set forth rules of consideration is to invite judicial review of compliance with those rules.   And that is, I think, your point. And I don't think it's a minor point. I think it's rather important. If the conciliation process is actually to work, let it go.   They're called conciliation -- what are the three words? 
13-1032 +++$+++    That isn't a very narrowing thing. I mean, Henry Friendly, some years ago, said of course you can use the term collection to refer to any method of helping to secure payment. But Congress was referring to methods similar to assessing and levy that would produce money or other property directly rather than indirectly. The reason being, once we start down your road, there is no stopping place.   GDP consists of about $16 trillion. It's very hard to think of even one of those trillion dollars that you couldn't figure out passed through somebody's hands who owed a tax and then later went into somebody else's hands and it would help the State or the Federal government to know from that second or third person how it got the money from the first person's hands. That's true of houses. It's true of food. It's true of -- in States that tax food. It's true of this desk. It's true of everything you can think of. And therefore, there will be -- I mean, ruled out, unless you are going to start line drawing, and I don't know what lines to draw. Therefore, said Henry Friendly, let's not. Let us read collection to mean what it means in context, namely what Hibbs suggests the three phrases mean. Read them together. That, I think, is the strongest argument against you and, therefore, I would like to hear your response.   Really, you can't ask your citizens the same way that the Federal government asks us? "Pay," that's their polite way of saying it. And by the way, if you fill out your form incorrectly, depending upon your state of mind, you may discover you are in prison. Now, that seems to be a not-perfect way of doing it, but it does tend to encourage people to pay the taxes that they believe they owe.   If they tell you the truth.   This is the west. I understand. I don't -- I'm from the west. (Laughter.)   I guess Federal law is the same because we have the, what is it, the AIA, the Anti-Injunction Act. So if Congress tomorrow passes a law -- I'm not saying they would -- but that anyone who hears of anyone paying anyone else any money for any service or good shall immediately report it to the nearest -- nearest IRS office, and if they fail to do so, it's a crime or we'll seize all his assets. You wouldn't be able to bring that suit for an injunction in Federal Court on the ground that it's a bit extreme. You'd have to wait and pay this whatever you're supposed -- you're not even supposed to pay, you just have to do it and then hope somebody challenges it.   No, no, I'm not interested in State now. I'm just interested in why it might be that it is wise for Henry Friendly to narrow this word "collection" because we knew not where we go when, in fact, it gets too broad.
13-1034 +++$+++    But what second -- second --   What about, you said second? You said two reasons. You got your first out and I'd like to hear your second.   She didn't.   Okay. Now I got the second one. Now I do have one guestion, and it's right related to Justice Scalia's, and it seems to me that that -- what he said, if I understand it correctly, makes this not too difficult a case, but you won't like it: That -- that we have long -- yes, it modifies law, but we have long, if we go back to the seminal case, Taylor. There is a Massachusetts statute. It forbids a burglary of a boat, a car, and a house. So what Justice Blackmun said -- I think it was he who wrote it -- go back to the documents to see whether he was charged with burglary of a house, a boat, or a car. So we have a tradition of looking back to the charging documents and maybe a couple of others to see what part of the statute. Now, this statute is a statute that first penalizes many, many things, packaging -- packaging is relevant here. What kind of packaging? Packaging of drugs. Okay. What drugs? It doesn't say drugs. It says controlled substance, so you have to cross-reference. Then we look to cross-reference, and it says controlled substance means a substance included on State schedule 12345 or part B, so it incorporates that. So then we go look to those documents, and those documents will have a long list. And we look to see here which of the documents on the list which is incorporated into the statute is he charged of packaging. Very simple. Happens it's not that simple to do, but that is absolutely traditional given our holdings on how to apply the categorical -- modified categorical system. So why not just do that right here? Solves every problem that's raised.   Well, that's -- it wouldn't make that law a nullity. Indeed, the person would be deportable provided when you went through the State charge, the State charge was you violated the packaging for use statute, packaging a controlled substance, in respect to Item 13 under Schedule II, which they could say, anyway, and that happens to be heroin. And if, in fact, when you went through Schedule III, Part 4(a), the word there was "alcohol," then it wouldn't. Now, that's simple. And if the State's charging practice is such that they don't tell you, that's eguivalent to a State charging practice that in Massachusetts didn't tell you whether you were accused of burglary of a boat, of a house or of a car. And if the State wants to do that, I guess it might be up to them if you get a guilty plea and then you could not deport the person.   Well, I want -- a lot of people -- but they can't control the State charging practices and the States are likely, for reasons of information, to put in the charge the whole thing, including the correct reference on the schedule. So is that the only thing you find wrong with it? And I agree with you that that is a slight problem, that -- that we'll read back the conviction of four years ago in Missouri and we will see that it doesn't tell us what item on the schedule. That's the problem that you see.   Any other?   You have to choose. As you well know, the problem you just mentioned is a problem that we're just having a terrible time with in respect to the violence add-ons. And it's -- stems from the fact that State laws differ one from the other enormously. So we either have that problem or we have the problem of you have a general statute and which does it apply more to and so forth. Or you have the problem of do you look -- as I think Justice Kagan's approach -- do you -- you look at the individual facts of the case and require them to prove it out again. I -- I don't see how we escape one serious problem or another.
13-1041 +++$+++    It did command a majority of the Court, it is authoritative decision, and there are obviously different views among different judges about the extent to which they are the same or not. So is there any reason that we have to get into all that? Which I hope the answer is no, but I think you have the best chance of thinking of a yes answer, so --
13-1074 +++$+++    I take it from what you have both argued so far, that there is nothing direct in terms of a report or a hearing or a statement on the floor that shows that anyone in Congress, staff or member, ever thought about this problem. Is that right?   So what we're doing then is we are, however we do it, creating a number -- not creating but following a number of legal rules, court developed, which seek to determine what the, guote, intent of Congress was on the basis of other things, not necessarily what they said or what they -- that's the situation?   Didn't -- I mean, the -- sorry, but I get -- I mean, what about many statutes existed saying -- inferring a certain use of the word about men sitting on juries. And the statutes that say those things were enacted long before anyone thought a woman would ever sit on a jury. But when they're interpreted by the courts, by and large, they're interpreted to include both genders. All right? There are many instances. So certainly Justice Scalia is right in my opinion that that is a rule that -- the one he enunciates, but neither an absolutely firm rule nor the only rule.
13-1075 +++$+++ 
13-1080 +++$+++    Just like the Department of Commerce acting under authority from Congress gave Icon the power to write standards for the internet.   I'm not saying it's a dire conseguence. By coincidence, I happen to be reading about the internet. I'm trying to learn about something.   You don't have to answer this guestion, but have you thought through what this means -- what I think is called the Baal conference where you have groups of regulators and banks meeting together to determine what they are going to do about interest rates, money supplied, et cetera. You have not, is the answer, and I don't know enough about it, so skip it.   Can the government -- what is the due process violation? That is to say, if the Department of Energy under delegated authority says that the makers of the bulbs that are energy efficient must use, and they may choose any one of the five methods that produces green light or white light or whatever it is, and they are -- they are to choose the method, and that's just it. Now, that puts at a disadvantage those competitors who do not use energy-efficient bulbs. Is that a violation of due process?   No. It gives them considerable leeway as to make subsidiary decisions. I was trying to make it realistic. They make subsidiary decisions as to how they go about fulfilling the basic energy efficiency mandate.   Well, I just described it now.   They have broad authority, but they have to meet certain energy-efficient mandates and they can prescribe standards and so forth that will allow them to do it. Does that violate due process because it hurts the manufacturers of ordinary energy bulbs?   It applies. They don't have to meet it. What happens is it gives them an advantage the way they choose over non-energy efficient bulbs.   Then what is your violation here? I'm trying to figure out what your violation --   The what?   That's what I was -- I'm trying to get at -- I started with the statement, I think, that due process -- your argument -- it didn't matter whether you called them private or public; am I right?   Okay. Now, let's imagine they're just a company, not the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy has a broad energy efficient standard. It delegates to the people who make that kind of bulb all kinds of minor interstitial standards to make. They make them. They hurt the energy bulbs, the ordinary energy bulbs. Is that a violation of due process? If so, why? If not, how is yours different?   It will hurt the other private organizations.   My reaction was the way you deal with that normally is the statute would be interpreted not to give them the authority to write anticompetitive regulations and you'd attack it under the antitrust laws. There may be other ways to do it. I've never heard of an example where the due process problem really was a constitutional problem under due process. Now -- now, maybe there's some cases I've overlooked. The only one coming close, it seemed to me, is Carter v. Carter Coal, which I always put in the same box as Lochner. Now -- now, are we supposed to resurrect that? Is there other authority for that proposition? What is it?   But your due process, I want some authority for your due process point on the private agencies.
13-1174 +++$+++    But his last point, this in my mind is that if we take your route -- one problem with his route -- one problem with your route is you have to muck around with the word "action." Well, you do. I mean, there's no doubt you do. You have to consider it a single action while it's consolidated. One problem with his route is that, A, nobody's ever done it, they've all thought you're right, and nobody's said much about it. And one problem with his route is you treat consolidations where the multidistrict panel is involved and you consolidate it for discovery differently than you treat consolidations in an ordinary district court, has four cases and consolidates them. That's the problem with his route. So it seems to me a sort of balance there. But one thing he said that I don't -- that did register is he said if we take your route, what happens when the multidistrict is over, see. Eight months ago, his case was dismissed, and a judgment was entered in his -- in his case, which is now only part of the case, on your theory. When is he supposed -- what is he appealing from? When did the 30-day clock begin to run? And suppose, by the way, it was never sent -- it was never really sent back because everybody else settled. How does that work?   Well, then you're just let's go back to my question. I agree with you, I'd always learned like Hornbook rule number 1 is, there is a separate piece of paper called a judgment entered by the district court, and that is what you appeal from. Now you have just told me, there isn't one here, in which case he can't appeal, okay, that's a separate reason. I'm now assuming another case. The case is, there is a separate piece of paper in his case called a judgment. His point is, that gives me a piece of paper called a judgment to appeal from, it was entered at a certain time and now I know when the clock starts.   Now, what I said Watts, some time ago, that I thought he had a point, is in such a case, if we treat the consolidation of approximate proceedings like we treat a consolidation of cases without the multidistrict, he cannot appeal from that piece of paper. He has to wait in the ordinary situation, not multidistrict, until there is another piece of paper resolving everything, then he starts to appeal but at least he has a piece of paper which maybe he lacked here. All right, now, he's saying here in the multidistrict situation, there will be a separate piece ( of paper, I can't appeal from, what is the piece of paper from which I know the clock on appeal begins to run?   That's a red herring at the moment.
13-1175 +++$+++  
13-1211 +++$+++  
13-1314 +++$+++    I'd like you to because as I read those two cases, they don't help you very much. I mean, Hildebrant is talking about a particular statute that was passed in 1911 and it helps the government with its statutory argument because a different statute uses similar words, but we don't know if it was with the same intent. Smiley talks about a sitting legislature and asks whether its exercise of map-drawing power is a legislative exercise or, say, more like an impeachment exercise. It doesn't talk about what's at issue here, where you have people outside that building making the judicial -- making a legislative decision. So I didn't see those two cases as helping you that much, though please argue to the contrary. But I think the great open question here is: What happens when legislative power, over time, expands from a group of people sitting in the State's capitol to those people plus a referendum? And there, I don't find much help in the cases one way or the other.   Well, the dictionaries, I take it, are your support. They say how the word is used. And no one defines the dictionary definition of "legislature" as "the power" -- we don't use that word "power" in this sense much anymore -- but "the power that legislates." The power that legislates in Arizona is the people in the capitol plus the referendums and the initiatives.   Yeah.   But it's not -- it's not that -- I'm not -- I'm just quibbling in a sense about the case. But the question in the case is not about -- they say, "the body." I mean, what's "the body"? Everybody agreed it was the legislature. But when the legislature acts in this instance, is it acting as an electoral body? Is it acting as a ratifying body? Is it acting as a consenting body, as with the acquisition of LAMS, or is it acting as a legislating body?   That's correct, and that's the answer they give. This is a form of legislation. Here, the question is about the body, and --   Yes, that's the question.
13-1333 +++$+++    What does it cost to file an appeal?   Sorry?   What do you think about the government's argument about the third? You imagine he has -- the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed. That's one. Now he does it again. That's two. And he does it a third time. District court dismissed. And he says, I want to appeal that, and I don't want to pay the $500, 505. The government has to say -- could say, sorry, you have to pay the 505. That's the third, because he's a separate. Then he says, but it says, "on a prior occasion," and this is the same occasion. And therefore he doesn't have to pay the 500. What's your view of that?   But that's -- that's the why I asked the question on page 25 of your brief; you say the bar goes into effect if the prisoners received strikes on three or more prior occasions. Now you say a prior occasion is not the district court dismissal in this third case. That's not a prior occasion. But when you look at the earlier two strikes, you don't consider it as a whole. Do we consider this one as a whole, but we don't consider the others as a whole. That's why I asked the question.   No, it doesn't -- yes, it does. Because the dismissal of -- by the district court of this lawsuit after it's done is a prior occasion. The present occasion is your appeal of that dismissal to the court of appeals.   I'm not saying it's good policy or anything. I'm just saying it's hard for me to see how you can say the one and not the other.   Good. And when we're in the second one, when you file the appeal from the first one, the new occasion hadn't started. So we're still in the middle of the occasion.   I'm going to fail this test because -- (Laughter.)
13-1352 +++$+++    To be fair to you, I don't think the misgivings come so much from -- they come from the fact that you don't want -- I don't want to see the Confrontation Clause swallow up the 30 exceptions to the hearsay rule, and therefore you have to draw lines. This case is tangential. This case involves tragedy either way. It's a tragedy to abuse children. It's a tragedy to put the wrong person in jail on the basis of unreliable testimony. Now, with that kind of tragedy, it seems tailor-made for the Due Process Clause, allowing States to experiment, allowing the bar to work out some of the things you say. What's at issue here to me, is the problem of not having that Confrontation Clause swallow up the 30 exceptions which are necessary in many instances for the justices of a trial. That's at a general level, since you asked.
13-1371 +++$+++    Can you go back to Justice Scalia's guestion, please? Because I took -- because I just want to hear your answer to it. As I understood his guestion, it was you look at the words and the words say, "make unavailable because of race." And what you're saying is those words, "make unavailable because of race," can include the circumstance where you make unavailable for a reason that has nothing to do with race where the effect of that reason is to cause a racial disparity of significance and it cannot be justified as the least restrictive way to bring about it. That's the point. But you're saying those words are consistent with the longer phrase I just said. Okay. Is there case law or other, aside from this area, which builds your point and says, yes, those words linguistically and legally do include the disparate-impact situation, or can. I take it that's his guestion and I was looking --   -- for an answer somewhat along --   -- those lines or any other --   What you're saying is suppose that the plaintiffs in this case, that side, wins -- to try -- they're trying to win. The defense, on the other -- it's not true that that means all Section 8 housing is now going to be -- or even a large amount is going to be put in rich neighborhoods. First, they can defend on the ground that we don't have that practice, to put it in poor neighborhoods. Second, they can say, yes, we do, but don't you see that isn't going to hurt minorities because it puts those minorities in housing where many of them are, unfortunately, in poor neighborhoods, and it doesn't have the great effect on desegregation that they think. Or third, if they lose on that, they can say but anyway it's justified for a whole bunch of reasons.  That's -- - and judges judge it -- Absolutely. - and HUD can come in and decide, and there is no need to throw the whole baby out -- or I don't know whether it's the baby or the bath water, whatever you're throwing out. But you don't have to throw out the whole big thing in order to prevent --
13-1402 +++$+++    Do we have to go into all that here? I mean, I thought -- I mean, taking the obvious thing, which would be most adverse to you or the second most adverse would be a possible answer, is to say all the government has to do is to tell the judge, judge, if we tell you which of the 25 different subsections apply here, that will hurt national security. And that's the end of the case. But your case, you say, is a case where the government won't say that because they are honest. When they get into court, they'll tell the truth; and if the truth is there is no adverse effect on national security, we at least would like to know that. That will help us. But they won't give us any reason, none. And if you go back to King John and the rule of law itself, certainly part of that is when you take action that adversely and seriously affects the -- a citizen of the United States. The norm is you at least have to tell them why. I mean, are you arguing for more than that minimal position in this case? Do we have to go beyond it?   But I think -- I think what you're saying, though I'm not certain, is simply -- you're not saying that the wife should be able to sue to get her husband out of prison, et cetera, but she does have a constitutionally protected interest. But to say a person has an interest is not to say how that protection goes. If you say we have all the examples of what would happen, if you say there is an interest and none of them need happen, now try it the other way. Suppose you say there is no interest. Then I guess if there's no constitutionally protected interest in living together with your spouse -- you can make up a hypothetical -- Congress passes a law that says all husbands and wives have to live separately, period. Is there anyone who thinks that there would be no court action in such a case? I mean, you can say a person has an interest. Then the next question is, what kind of protection does the law give to that interest? And you're bringing a case where the answer is, virtually none, and you want a little bit. But it has the real problems that people have raised. Now, is that -- is that a fair description of what you're saying?
13-1487 +++$+++    Where does all this come from? I mean, to me, when somebody uses the word "constructive X," that just means it's not X and -- and it's a way of pretending that it's X when it isn't. So I start with that and say what you're worried about here -- of course, he doesn't have any possession of it. You have possession of it. And what he wants to do is he wants to put it somewhere so he can't get ahold of it as long as the law prevents him from having it. And you took it from him. You made him give it to him. So what's wrong with his saying, you go give it to somebody? Now, if it's too much trouble, the judge can say he can't make you go to a lot of trouble. If it's giving it to somebody who might really do everything he wants, we'll guard against that. That's the job of the district judge. End of case. Now, what -- what's -- what's -- simple, realistic, preserves the government's interest. What's wrong with it?   I   -- things like that, and I don't understand any piece of it that has something in that like it.   Okay. So we don't want them. So we'll say to the district judge, Judge, use some common sense. Don't let this gun get into the hands of the crime boss of the area. Don't let the things that you were just talking about happen. And you look to see how much trouble it is, what's likely to happen, and where it makes sense. And if it isn't likely for these bad things to happen, fine.   But what is it you want to have happen; that is, the gun was taken away from him.   He can't possess it anymore. It's in the hands of the court, I guess, or the government. Okay. Now, it's his. It's a 1891 collector's item; he's a gun collector. Nobody is claiming it's forfeitable, or anything. Okay. What do you think should happen?   Is that going to be your -- your position -- I mean, because I'm getting away from the -- what I call the legal mumbo-jumbo. Looking at the word "possessed" there, fine. It's a guestion of interpreting that. And now where I thought, well, he can't just have it sold to anybody. I mean, it could be sold -- you don't want it sold to somebody who's going to do his bidding every five minutes. I mean, maybe he'd even agree with that. And that now you're taking the opposite extreme. You're saying the only way to administer this, is the only thing really you can do with it, is you can sell it to a Federal -- through a Federal firearms dealer. And there are probably intermediate positions. You know, I mean, somebody has a very valuable antigue weapon the Normans used to shoot or something. And he says, I don't want to sell it. I'm going to be able to possess it again in ten years. They'll forgive me for whatever it is, and maybe you should accommodate that, or maybe you shouldn't. I have no feeling for how important it is to have an absolute rule. You've given some good reasons for it. What am I supposed to do? Just say everybody agrees here you can't sell it your best friend who will keep it to you, so they're wrong on that rule. The government's position's is now let's do something else with it. Maybe absolute. Maybe not. Go work it out, Eleventh Circuit. Go work it out, lower court. What should we do?   Is this Federal license --   Well, then why can't we do that here?   I mean, your whole argument -- the reason I took it that the government wants this firearm thing, firearm dealer, is they say, look, there are a lot of guns and these guns should be safe and we're afraid he'll give them to a friend, and we're afraid maybe the gang boss will get them, and the only safe thing to do is really the firearms dealer. Okay. But now we think of a similar kind of case. It's just happened that the government didn't get the guns first, they're in his house. And then you say well, the solution there is it's a reasonable time. He has a reasonable time to do with them what he wants.   What about just forgetting the words "dominion" and "constructive" and just look to the word "possession" and say that that sometimes includes control? And what you want to prevent is that he disposes of these arms in a way that allows him, possibly, to control them in the future or control them now in a way that likely puts them in the hands of bad people for the future. Now, that way, all we have to do is look at the word possession. We have to add that it includes, for purposes of this statute, certain kinds of control. And then you have to say this is the simple rule, and this will prevent two bad kinds of control. Now, is there something wrong with that? If so, we then send it back so that you can argue to the district court why your rule is necessary to prevent these two bad kinds of control.   I know, that's the part that it's hard for me to accept.   Because you're willing to allow that control in the case that Justice Alito put where he was convicted and it's in his house. And I don't see anything bad that flows from that kind of control. And I don't see why you have to read the statute to include that kind of control to achieve any purpose that the statute has. So therefore, I tend, tentatively, to reject that kind of control as falling within what the statute forbids.   What bad will happen?   That might be another way to do it, you know. All right. You have a difficult conceptual case.
13-1499 +++$+++    Go back for a second, to me, because I actually think judges should try to keep their preconceptions under control and decide the individual case. And I think that is a widely shared perception and I think that Florida has every right to say we want to further that. But what is your distinction between what I took as an important argument on the other side, and maybe you've said it already but I want to hear it again. Florida lets judges write thank-you notes for contributions so there is direct contact and the person who has given the money knows that the judge knows that he gave it.   All right? What's the difference between that and this rule, which says that the judge cannot write to that individual in the first place asking for the money.   One -- just one would be enough, but I want to know what they are.   And is it unlawful under Florida law to put in a letter written by the campaign manager "and I will tell the judge"?   "And I will tell the 3 judge."   All right. Very well, then, he might know.   All right. So what's the second one?   I want to know what the differences are, which is a main point that was argued that once you say they can write a thank-you note, and indeed, as you've added, in the initial letter you can say, "and I will tell the judge"? Once Florida permits those things, what is it that Florida's current 7C interpretation adds to that? And if it adds nothing of significance, why is it constitutional? That's their whole argument.   I want to hear your responses.   You know, I would prefer -- maybe there is no answer.   One answer is to say it does exactly the same, it adds nothing but you don't have to deal with every problem. I've got that answer. Do you have any answer that says it does add something? If so, what?   It's not just confidence in the judiciary, is it? I mean, to ask -- for a judge to ask for a guid puts pressure on people to give it. And that is a different evil than their simply knowing what happens, and I would say probably worse. To send a thank-you note is a form of politeness that creates knowledge, but does not to the same degree put pressure on the person to contribute. Now, is that fair or not fair? And don't just say yes because you think it's on your side, because I'll have plenty of people pointing out to me that it isn't necessarily a good argument, if it isn't.   Where does it come from, justice shall not be sold nor shall it be denied? I mean, that's at least 800 years old. And if that defines the role of the judge, which I think it does, you're saying that it isn't. It is a -- you do look to the degree to which you are interfering with the free speech, which is some degree, some, and it's not speech, it's really how you solicit money; and on the other side, how that interferes with that basic role of the judge. So then is it not relevant? But the interference, even with raising money, which is at one degree from speech, is small.   Why is it a great burden? Does it change because you elect the judge, that you're changing the fundamental role of the judge?
13-212 +++$+++    There had to be two buttons, two buttons.   Now, was there a claim made in this case that exigent circumstances, destruction of evidence, or officer safety justified the search?   No? Okay. So I guess that if there is a rule that says you can search phones, then you could do it. After all, you might search a phone and come up with an advertisement for a Walt Disney movie, which is perfectly public. But if the rule is you can't search phones, ( then you win, even though in this case they came up with something that was -- is -- is that right or not?   I mean, if, in fact, you can search the phone thoroughly for everything in the person's life, they might have come up with something when he was six years old, there is, in fact, a picture of an elephant at the zoo. Totally public. But it would still fall within the rule, which what I thought one of the things we're arguing about in this case.   All right. Well, what is your argument for the proposition, look, when you search a phone, sometimes what you come up with is perfectly public information; sometimes what you come up with is private information. Now, you want to say the absolute rule should be no. But what's your argument, rather than trying to say sometimes if you get the private information, no; but if you get the public information, yes, et cetera?
13-271 +++$+++    All that is true, but it might depend on how. That is, the way I'm thinking about this which is out of date but perhaps analogous. We have El Paso, it picks up gas in the Permian Basin. It ships it up to Ohio. It sells it to a retail distributor in Toledo. Classic. FERC regulates the sale for resale, and the local regulator regulates the price to the distributor. Now, there is what used to be a further bizarre and unusual occurrence which is now common. On the way, El Paso sells directly to a manufacturer. And that seems to be at the heart of your case.   Right. So now I'm thinking we're back to cost of service ratemaking. Suppose under cost of service ratemaking, you have FERC which said El Paso is charging too much money for sales for resales because it doesn't do its depreciation properly. Okay. You'd better load them. Now, suppose a state via antitrust or any other way said the reason that the sales that are direct to the manufacturer are unlawful under state law is because it doesn't do its depreciation properly, and suppose that the depreciation the state is talking about is identical to the depreciation that FERC is talking about. I would say absolute preemption. And if I'm right about that, in this case, we don't have depreciation rules, but we have price setting by consulting Joe's Gas Journal. And here, what the state is saying is the consultation with Joe's Gas Journal that the state wishes to make unlawful is identical to the consultation with Joe's Gas Journal that FERC wants to make unlawful and upon which rests FERC's wholesale price determination. Okay? Just like the depreciation. And if the one is field preempted, so is the other. Now that's the analogy I've been going through in my mind, just waiting to ask you, because I would be very interested in your response.   But that is conflict preemption --   -- not field preemption.   Yes, yes, but wait. Suppose, in our classical system years ago, that El Paso Gas gets a price set for resale at FERC equal to three dollars a thousand cubic feet, and then the Ohio regulator, in regulating the price of the distribution company, forces it down for the reason that it thinks that three dollars for the wholesale part is too high. Not close. They couldn't do that?   So it depends on their reason for thinking that the price or the sale -- they can't regulate the sale any way they want. They can't regulate it in a way that would interfere with and probably is, or is field-preempted by, FERC's authority to set wholesale rates.   So you can't -- let me think of a better -- the -- the State, it faces a three dollar cost of goods sold to the wholesale pipeline, to El Paso, plus an additional claimed dollar in expenses, including reasonable profit. They're asked for $4 at the -- in your house. The State says, no, we're not going to give you $4, and the reason is that the $3 is too high. Now, you say that conflicts with FERC. No, it doesn't. FERC made a mistake. They will be delighted when they see that we've gone into the depreciation rules more thoroughly than their own rules and they should have said 2.50 instead of 3. And when they read our opinion, they're going to jump for joy. To prevent that, we have field preemption, not conflict preemption.   That's a different argument.   Well, actually, Louisiana. It's the same point, but in addition, you just said you agreed that they had field preemption over the setting of wholesale rates; that is, sales for resale.   And they're saying that it's the reporting to Joe in his magazine, the false reporting to Joe in his magazine.   That is what we use to set the wholesale rate, the reporting of Joe to his magazine. And so what they're suing about is the very single fact that we use to set the wholesale rate, and therefore, it falls within our wholesale jurisdiction. That's their argument. And you say the -- that's their argument, not yours.
13-352 +++$+++    Could you do this -- I don't know if you have time -- but with an example. The reason I'm having a hard time, I'm thinking Louis Vuitton, say, all right. Now Lilly Vuitton wants to register a mark. Okay. So we go to the TTAB and it's for lipstick. And Lilly says, look it, it says Lilly Vuitton and Louis says, yeah. And now the question is well, will it cause confusion when used in connection with the lipstick?   So we look at it. All right. Now we're in the infringement action. Exact same situation. And here they are supposed to say, will it cause confusion when you -- when -- will it cause confusion in connection with the sale of any goods or services which includes the lipstick? So I'm having a terrible time seeing what the difference is.   It may be what I said, but I just didn't see it.   Yes. And it says the same thing here. It says does it so resemble a mark as to cause confusion when used in connection with the goods?   It's the resemblance in connection with the goods.   Not how they're used. Okay. So what about saying this then. We'd say, if it turns out that in your infringement case that was really an issue, you know, that was really a big deal in this -- a serious deal in this case, it's not because of the use of the goods, it's because of the resemblance through advertising cures it. Then you don't have -- not -- not precluded. You are only precluded in the case the SG says, which is where everything is really the same.   Well, it says right here, "so resembles a mark as to be likely to cause confusion when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant."   So why doesn't Nike say, look at the Sike mark, look at how it's used. As it's used and we use ours with a swish, of course it causes confusion. Wouldn't they be free to tell the board that?   They can't?   Ah.   Your example --   Quick question. If you are right about the difference between resembling causing confusion and using in connection causing confusion, then if you go to the review procedure and you go into the full district court, that doesn't preclude either.   So there's no preclusion whether you go to the district court or not in your basic statutory view there.
13-433 +++$+++    What you have here which you could address in this is -- he's quite right, Mr. Clement. Steiner uses the words three or four times, the integral and indispensable, but they qualify activities that take place outside of regular work hours. I think here it's conceded that it takes place outside regular work hours, it's indeed after checkout, etcetera. So the question becomes integral and indispensable and they have gloss on that and so forth. Okay. So I'm in the situation probably I'd say go with the Labor Department. They are the ones who are in charge of this. And they are saying you lose. They point to something in 1951. And I have two questions. The first one is, is there anything else you want to put in besides this very detailed complaint? And the second question is, okay, why don't you lose? What am I supposed to do with that opinion? It's sitting there --   Well, that's true, but it's never seen in ad law in this area that -- okay, you can cite Skidmore et cetera. But --   But they are telling us now.   Well, the answer to the first question, which was yes or no, there isn't anything else you want to put in the record. You are perfectly content with our deciding this on the facts that are in the complaint?   What would the rule be -- suppose there weren't a special section about clothing. Suppose that didn't exist and -- and suppose you had to change into a uniform. Would that be compensable or not?   What is the history?   But if it's a uniform   So you're saying if you didn't have that special section, this is compensable. If it were a change of clothing, it had to take place on site.   And so this isn't really different from that.   You're on site and it's no -- it's the same kind of burden that you might have to have protective clothes or some kind of special thing that you change into on site.   What's the example that you you found that's the closest to this that favors you?   Hmm?   Drug testing.   I mean, is that well established?   What about checkout?   Well, they say this is like checkout. You go -- you go check out, put your time card in, check out.   Why? What's the theory? I mean, what's the theory?   But they're thinking -- see, the other side says, well, this is like checking out, you know.
13-435 +++$+++    But assuming they're wrong about this, they said the Section 11 does not require a plaintiff to plead a defendant's state of mind, and a statement of opinion is actionable when it is ultimately found to be false. Now, that, I don't think, is what you are arguing, what the SG is arguing. The point is that the statement, it is my opinion that the warehouse will hold up in a 93-mile-an-hour wind for 17 hours as long as the windows are closed. And that statement may be false, but it may also be true that the issuer before issuing the statement performed a variety of tests, in which case you would agree, I think, that it is not actionable. And so -- so it isn't just that it's false, it's that there was no reasonable basis for holding it. Moreover, whether the issuer has a reasonable basis is a fact about the issuer's state of mind. It isn't whether there's a reasonable basis in the world. It is about whether those people who issued this statement had a reasonable basis for issuing it or not. I think that's about their state of mind in a sense. But those two things, I think, do require reversal.   No.   No, no, I don't see how that could be. They said, in our opinion, we have X amount of inventory. And you're starting out by saying, well, it is an opinion, but an opinion carries the implication that they would have some basis for it. And they did have a basis for it. In fact, they had a reasonable basis. So how there can the plaintiff recover?   Okay. You've given me those times. What about the other times?   Well, why wouldn't they just say, Look, the statement turned out to be false, we don't doubt that he did hold that opinion as his opinion, he was sincere, but he had no basis for that whatsoever, period. That's what the complaint says. Now, how can you avoid discovery on that?   He never looked into it. He had no basis for it. That's trying to prove a negative. What are they supposed to allege a negative, he didn't go to the law books, didn't go to the library, didn't talk to this, didn't talk to that. I mean, it's pretty hard to do, isn't it?
13-502 +++$+++    You say on -- suppose we're talking about the context of signs. You say, well, let's look to the purpose of forbidding -- any prohibition, and I guess it has to do with safety or beautification.   First question would be Is there some category that you don't allow to put up signs? Answer, no. Everybody can put up signs. So what about applying strict scrutiny to that? If you are going to distinguish on the basis of what the sign says, you have to have an awfully good reason, if your decision is you can't put up one at all. Next, you put them up, but you have all content -- all kinds of distinctions how, how long, et cetera. Now, in respect to that, maybe you should have more leeway, leeway depending upon the purpose of the sign. So if, for example, it's about an open air, municipal movie, you could say put up signs about movies or something. I mean, you know, you maybe have more leeway there. But still they're saying you would flunk even that test here because there isn't really a very good reason at all in this case for making the sign smaller or for putting it there for such a short time. Now, how do you react -- there are three parts: One, very tough if you are going to say you can't put it up at all, sometimes called strict scrutiny; two, somewhat more lenient if it gets up, but you are trying to distinguish among how and under what circumstances, how long; and then three, do you even satisfy that one? That's called time, place and manner, the second one.   What is this about, this argument? I mean, you agree they can put up a big sign. Can they put up a big sign, ideological, saying, "Come to the next service next Tuesday, 4th and H Streets, three blocks right and two blocks left"? All right? Or are you saying they can't say, "three blocks right and two blocks left"? That's what this argument is about?   Well, my goodness. I mean -- I mean, on that, it does sound as if the town is being a little unreasonable, doesn't it?   Suppose we said this where, in fact, the argument is of this nature, where, in fact, there are -- you can have a big sign and have everything on it except an arrow, and the purpose of the sign is, in fact, to tell people both what is happening and where. That there is no good, under any test, reason for requiring this little dingy thing? End of the case. Let's go with that.
13-517 +++$+++  
13-534 +++$+++    Maybe we can pursue this, because I think that's the guestion exactly that is bothering me, but I have another example of the same thing, and I think it's for me a very difficult case. On the one hand, I absolutely understand the cases, and I understand the law -- at least I think I do. You would be pretty careful about having a group of wine merchants set their own prices or decide who can sell. And the same is true of a group of railroads and the same is true of a group of truckers and the same is true blah, blah, blah, okay, probably including dentists. So what we have is a set of pretty tough rules saying the State had better get in there and supervise or you are subject to the antitrust laws. That to me is the state of the art. And that all seems fine and you seemed -- until I thought of a different example. Now, what they are is they are neurologists and they are brain surgeons, and what the State says is: We would like this group of brain surgeons to decide who can practice brain surgery in this State. I don't want a group of bureaucrats deciding that. I would like brain surgeons to decide that. Of course the risks are -- and so we have to have some supervision, I guess. What? What kind of supervision? And why isn't that present here? A, any rule has to go to some rule revision agency. B, before they can throw anybody out, they have to go into court and get a court order. And C, even these letters would be subject to their state ABA. So if I'm on your track, I want to see you talk about the neurologists and any kind of serious medical board, and I don't want to suddenly destroy all the temptation of medical boards throughout the country to decide everything in favor of letting in the ungualified person, lest he sue them under the antitrust law for treble damages and attorneys' fees. Those are the things that -- have you followed where I'm coming from? And I would very much appreciate your comment.   Under that practice, you said it's not an antitrust violation: Boycott. The guy didn't get into the profession. He flunked the exam. The antitrust lawyer says: I'm out of this profession; I would offer them competition. We only have 82 gualified people in this specialty in this State. Now there is only 81. That makes a difference. Their guestions are unfair, they are against me, and for a bunch of reasons. Silver v. New York Stock Exchange. You know, it's not hard to make up reasons. I don't want to cut you off from Justice Alito, but I would like you to also, in doing that, to think about what my problem is. It's the neurologists who are subject to the antitrust suit. And the answer seems to lie in the kind of supervision that you are advocating. Now, go ahead and go back to Justice Alito, but I put that in your mind.   Does that consist of -- if you want my off-the-cuff idea, which is probably not particularly good to give you -- that active -- that supervision consists of either your board on regulation or a court which, when reviewing what they do, does so with an awareness of the State law and the subject and also the risks of anticompetitive harms. Ready to set it aside if, in fact, those risks, which are outside what the State law wants, seem likely to eventuate. Now, I could write such a standard pretty vaguely and that's not necessarily the right standard. But this whole thing turns to me on what the supervision consists of and whether it's good enough or not here. And so that's why I repeat for the -- you know, like the third time, and I think you -- probably the government doesn't have a definite position on this or what it consists of.   Not that you should. But I just want to --   But they'd have to give deference to the expert board's determination that would be normal.   Well, if it's not, then you're going to have the neurology gualification determination made by some people in the State who are not neurologists. Now, that to me spells danger.   Look. Take your -- suppose I write that down. Still the problem in the back of my mind is there are now 311 million Americans who are going to have medical care. And this is -- I agree with you. This is at one extreme. But -- but those words that you just enunciated seem to cover to exactly the same extent every medical specialty. And I've articulated that already that that's my concern. So I wonder if you can do something a little bit better before we say that the doctors cannot be active doctors and decide on the gualifications of doctors.
13-550 +++$+++    That's -- that's the nature or --   You're talking about the nature of the fiduciary's duty to continuously monitor. Isn't that your subject? I'd like before doing that, since you seem to agree there is some such duty, but you may disagree of what it consists of and nobody so far in the lower courts has really gone into that, probably we should send it back on that, say they agree about that. But then you want it dismissed because you say that that issue wasn't fairly raised. All right. So I look at the cert petitions; and in their cert petition on page 18, 19, 20, et cetera, it seems to me pretty clear that they're saying the mistake in the Ninth Circuit was ignoring the continuing nature of a trustee's duty under ERISA to review plan investments and eliminate imprudent ones.   They're guoting the Seventh Circuit. So when I read that, they're making the argument pretty clearly. Add that that's -- there is this nature, that there is this duty. And they say the Ninth Circuit didn't hold that. The Ninth Circuit thought it existed only when there was a change. So I looked to your reply to that. You do not, to -- to -- I can't find a place in your reply -- in your reply to their cert petition, in either, where you say they have an incorrect assumption here because you should dismiss this case and never hear it because that isn't what the Ninth Circuit said. Rather, the Ninth Circuit said a different thing. Now, where -- where do you say that? I couldn't find it. And if you didn't say it, it seems to me that you have waived, in a sense, the argument that they have waived in a different sense. All right. You see the point.   Well, what you say, I have this that you said. The Ninth Circuit held that a statute -- that "a claim challenging the selection of mutual funds" -- da, da, da -- "is barred by the six-year statute if the claim challenges funds that were selected more than six years before, and the claim does not allege that any materially new circumstances arose within the previous six years." So that sounds like the very characterization of the Ninth Circuit that they are saying was mistaken.   So it seems as if you are agreeing that the Ninth Circuit made a mistake. You are agreeing they should have put this in, and I guess you also agreed that in their brief in the Ninth Circuit, they did say, "Edison had a continuing duty to ensure that each of the plans' investments was and remained prudent, was and remained prudent within the six years," et cetera. So -- so they raised it in the Ninth Circuit. You agree the Ninth Circuit made the wrong holding --   -- and -- and you agree what the right holding is. All right. So what's -- what is the argument we should dismiss it?   What about this --   -- about this result? Two paragraphs: The parties agree that there is this ongoing monitoring, et cetera. The Ninth Circuit did say changed circumstances. It's wrong about that. Nobody here in the reply brief to cert really raised the guestion of whether it had been properly raised; and, therefore, we remand the case to apply the law insofar as is in the proper procedure to do it, something like that.
13-553 +++$+++    Did -- did the court of appeals deal with your point you just made about the -- a special purpose of the extra tax that the truckers pay?   What I'm trying to figure out is -- is how are they supposed to conduct this comparison analysis?   What they did is they didn't do it.   Right.   Well, fine. But suppose that the -- suppose the reason that the truckers have to pay this extra tax is not to go into a fund that benefits them. Suppose, indeed, it's to go into a fund that benefits railroads. I mean, so -- so doesn't -- you have to -- you have to say whether or not -- you wouldn't say that no matter what the purpose of this extra tax is don't consider it, would you?   Of course it isn't. You won. And -- and the -- the -- and what --   What's worry -- what's worrying me is --   -- you know, but it's not -- it's -- State taxes are so complex and -- and that they didn't even have a -- they didn't really have a chance -- they could have, but they didn't, go into the what is this extra tax the truckers pay, is it comparable, and that's a good reason for having them pay less sales tax, or does it really have nothing to do with the price of anything and, therefore, it's a bad reason and, therefore, you win. They didn't consider that. That's what's worrying me. And if I send it back, if I -- if we do that, not only do we have to do it, they have to go through all this again.   We're going to have to tell them just what to do, which that sounds worse to me, and -- and, moreover, it may come back here again.
13-604 +++$+++    Can I ask you a question? I'd just like you to address for a minute -- assume for the sake of argument that I agree with you that a reasonable mistake of law that I -- is an excuse. But what is a reasonable mistake? Now, that's what I'd like you to address. And in particular, would you have objection to: It has to be, one, exceedingly rare; two, objective; three, it is -- has to be that a reasonable lawyer would think that the policeman was right on the law, and only if after, to quote you brief, a careful scrutiny and serious difficulty in construing the law, does it turn out that he is wrong. Now, what do you think about that or some other standard?   All right. If you agree with those then what about this case? Because after all, it does say a stamp light -- a stop light. What's the difficulty of construing that to mean a stop light?   Only after a careful scrutiny and serious difficulty in construing the law does it turn out that the officer was wrong. What's the difficulty?   It stays a stamp -- a stop light.   Well, now I forgot one thing, which may be obvious to me. We're not talking about a difficulty in construing the Fourth Amendment itself? We're talking only about a difficulty in construing a criminal statute, where, in fact, the reason for the stop or seizure is based on a violation of criminal law.
13-628 +++$+++    So how are we --   Can you help me with this same question? How should we approach it generally? That is to say, I can think of instances where a similar statute is serving nothing other than administrative matters -- the passport should be red or something -- and I can think of instances where it causes a lot of trouble. But I can think of instances like this one, and I could and you could easily replicate this controversy with Israel in our imaginations, similar controversy with Donetsk and the Ukraine, where we make some agreement with Russia and something similar comes up, or with Iran, and pretend that -- remember that Russia once invaded the northern part of Iran. And all over the world there can be similar kinds of problems where it's debatable what the words of the passport actually mean or how they will be taken by others and what others will think they mean. Now, how do we, who know little about it, determine, when it gets into the realm, that we should stay out of it and let the President and the Constitution gives him that power or should -- some think we should always intervene, perhaps some never. What in your mind is the right standard? How do we decide?
13-6827 +++$+++    I take it there's no example, not a single example in any State, that allows beard policies where somebody did hide something in his beard.   So we have no example.   So there is no such examples. Then do you think it might fit within the language of that report which says that the fear of people hiding things in their beards is, to use their language -- what was it -- grossly exaggerated? I mean 42 States. You know where I'm guoting from. I'm guoting from the report there. The exact words are what they are trying to get at is "exaggerated fears." It doesn't even say gross there. Would you say it's an ! exaggerated fear that people would hide something in their beards when, in a country of a very high prison population, not one example has ever been found of anybody hiding anything in his beard, as far as you can tell and as far as I can tell.   Do I have that right?   No. There are a lot of things we've never found that might be there and I'll refrained from mentioning them. You see them on television, a lot of weird programs from time to time. (Laughter.)
13-684 +++$+++    Where does it say all that? I mean, what it seems to say is that a person who borrows some money borrows money. Now, he can tell the lender, I changed my mind. When? Well, within three days or later of the time he sends them certain information. Okay? Three days later he has to get the information. So he has three days after that.   That's the end of it. And how do you do it? It says you do it by sending him a notice. That's what it says. So -- so send him a notice, and you do it. When do you have to do it? You have to do it three days after he sends you certain information, but in no case beyond three years. Now, that's what it seems to say.   Now -- now, how -- how do you get out of that? That's what I don't quite understand. It's like you're Houdini, I mean --   What?   Yes.   No, that's not what it says at the beginning. It says, "You shall have the right to rescind by notifying the creditor."   So it doesn't say that's notice by notifying the creditor. It says, "the right to rescind by notifying the creditor." I mean, okay. Go ahead. Now, that -- I'm just expressing my -- you see the problem I have. I read the words, and it seems to me it's pretty tough.   I know you don't. That's why we're here.   By that, if you say the rescission doesn't -- the right to rescission has to be -- it just expires after three years. Well, we don't know if he has a right to rescind until the lawsuit is actually terminated.   So -- so he -- we're just as much in the dark. He happened to have filed a piece of paper called a lawsuit, but the judge is extremely slow. I have known some.   And -- and ten years later, there it is, sitting on his docket and -- and nobody knows. How are we any more -- how are we any more enlightened than the day before he filed the lawsuit?   Of course not. Of course not.   Of course not. But I'm just saying why pick the date that you file a lawsuit in -- in terms of the validity of the note --   Since the -- the filing of the lawsuit no more determines the validity of the notice than it was determined three days before.
13-7120 +++$+++    No, I'm just saying what other reason could they have had for making this a crime, the possession --   Where did Congress say that? Where? Where? I mean, a felon in possession has a gun, and you say he might keep it upstairs in his closet, in the back of a car, in his hand, many places he might possess it, and he might never use it for a crime. Recognizing that, you say that doesn't fall within the statute. Just substitute the words "sawed-off shotgun." In the closet, back of a car, glass case, maybe in his hand, maybe in somebody else's hand. Maybe he just says to somebody: I have a sawed-off shotgun up there; give me your money. All right? All those things are possible with either. And so since they're possible with either, on what basis do we write an opinion that says that you win with the sawed-off shotgun, but you lose with almost every other kind of gun. What's our theory? What lines would there be in that opinion?   My goodness, stop right there for a second, because what we heard was there are 40,000 or more people in 10 States and others that don't even make it unlawful. So how can we say it's more associated with crime than, what, a handgun or a regular -- or a torpedo? I don't know.   I realized you were going to say that, and all I put that in was to express my own lack of knowledge of which is which, and therefore I can't just speak ex cathedra and say this. I would have to have some proof.   Well, I don't  I mean, I've seen a lot of movies. James Cagney used to, but I can't use that.   We couldn't say the same thing with a Saturday night special?   They used to be. A Saturday night special is a kind of pistol that was really used very, very heavily with robberies and crimes. They were viewed -- that was one of the first things that people tried to get banned after assassinations and so forth.   No, no. This isn't a machine gun. It's a pistol, a handgun.   No.   Is there -- the proposition then that I must accept I think for you to prevail is possession of that which is normally used or has a very serious risk of being used in a way that risks physical injury to another falls within the statute. And instead of drawing a line between possession and some other use of the thing, we say sometimes possession is in itself within the statute, sometimes it's not. If you possess those things that have as a predominant use participation in a matter that's likely to cause physical injury to another, that's within the statute. If that's the proposition, is there any case where simple possession of anything has been interpreted as falling within this language? I don't know the answer to that.   Any, any case.   Well, I know -- you've won this issue in --   But it's this issue. There's not some other area I could look at?   There's a Fourth Circuit case and then this line right here. Okay.   What would you think, which I once suggested and certainly didn't have the nerve to follow through, that it's more likely that the Department of Justice, with the aid of the sentencing commission, could get the relevant statistics than it is that a defendant could. So if no statistics appear, we should draw a presumption against the department.   Yes, yes. I realize that.   But could you do something, that is to say, even without legislation? Is it possible that the department, through its statistical gathering resources, and it has some, working with the sentencing commission, could help us more on the -- on the underlying statistical data that would give us a clue as to what was dangerous and what was not?
13-719 +++$+++    You actually started out by saying 1447(d), which I thought had nothing to do with this case. That is, I thought that they -- they were going -- the relevant statute is 1453(c) (1), which says a court of appeals may accept an appeal, notwithstanding Section 1447(d), from an order of the district court granting or denying a motion to remand. All right? So we are not talking about 1447(d); we are talking about 1453(c)(1). Now, what they did is they said they have an order, and the order says, no, we won't accept it. And the guestion is, is that order reviewed in this Court? I didn't think there was disagreement that it is reviewable. If they had said, We will not accept it because if we think that it only applies to stoppage in transitu cases, they would have their reason. Their reason would have been wrong, and I guess we could review it. Is that right or not?   Yes or no?   No, we can't review any case when they turn it down, no matter what their reason. Do you have any authority for that proposition?   No. It doesn't adopt it. It says notwithstanding Section 1447(d), a court of appeals may accept an appeal. So please accept my appeal; court of appeals says no. My guestion to you is, does this Court have the authority to review the order that says no?   No, it doesn't --   No matter how terrible the reason, it doesn't. That's your answer?   No, no. I'm saying my hypothetical is they do not accept the appeal.   They say we do not accept the appeal because 1453 only applies to stoppage in transitu. Okay? A totally wrong reason. Now, are you saying we do not have the jurisdictional authority to review that order which says "denied"?   Yes, denied for some clearly improper reason. Are you saying that? And if so, I'd like to know the authority for that because we have plenty of cases that go with the analogous certificate of appeal in habeas cases -- cases where we take it.   All right. If you don't have any cases, we might file the other way. If you agree, and you don't -- all right, I don't know where to go from here because if you're going to say we can't take authority where they absolutely can't hear the case, where it's absolutely clear they're wrong, then I don't know where to go.   I don't do that, but, I mean, but I'm not going to get you to say anything more.   Not necessarily. I mean, it's the same as a complaint. They allege paragraph 1, paragraph 2, paragraph 3, and the defendant comes in and says admitted, denied; admitted, denied; not enough information. All right. So you do the same thing. What's the problem?   They have to allege the facts. They have to allege facts. They have to say the allegation is and so forth. And you say they're not.   Isn't that a fact?   Isn't 8.2 million a fact?   Well, it's a fact. They said in their view --   All right. I don't know what a conclusory fact is as opposed to a regular fact. That seems like a lot of money to me, but I --   Briefly, the Court has jurisdiction of cases in the court of appeals.   All right. Now, when in fact a party appeals a district court's remand, he files that appeal paper in the court of appeals. The case is there. Before they decide it, we could take it. After they decide it, and if they affirm it, or if they decide to hear it, we could take it. It's there. But suppose they say no. Does that remove it from the court of appeals? If the answer to that guestion, which is your position that you're arguing, is now this Court can't take it, then it can't take anything. It can't take the same things down in the -- in the habeas cases. It can't take the attorney's fees things. It can't take anything, I would guess because it would say where a court has discretion and says, no, we are not taking it, it's not reviewable in this Court because it's no longer in the court of appeals. Now, what's -- is that your position? You can see I don't think it's a very good position from my tone of voice. But if there's something else, maybe there's a better one.   Well, no, you -- I mean, I'm often wrong in these things.
13-7211 +++$+++    Before you leave that, I thought that your opposing counsel said that did happen here. It was -- you did raise a question of -- of whether there was enough prejudice and, therefore, they were entitled to bring in the third as showing that even if the first two weren't sufficient, the third made up for it.   If he could take his first appeal, how does it work? That is, it seems to me that I've seen lots of petitions in habeas where an incarcerated person will bring up 40 arguments. Now, suppose that he loses on 39 and he wins on one and he gets his new trial, and the court -- the prosecution says fine, we'll go ahead, we'll give you the new trial. Is the lawyer then supposed to appeal his 39 losses?   No, no. You said he could take the first appeal. So before the new trial goes on he says, I think I'll take the first appeal on the other 39 that I lost on. Can he do that?   Well, then a lot of people, you know, I'm not saying they're badly motivated, they're in prison, they might think this sort of interesting, I might lose at trial, let's just see if I can't find a few other grounds here.   I've never heard of that. Have you found examples where that's happened?   Wait. Have you found many, one, cases where a petitioner won in the District Court, there is no State appeal, but he did lose on other grounds and he decided to take a first appeal on several of those other grounds?   All right. Suppose the -- isn't it   Thinking here to the -- the Criminal Justice Foundation filed a brief, and -- and as I read it, I thought, well, the point -- the point of this is don't make it too complicated. So they say, well, let's just consider what Estelle says, you can't -- you have to make a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal right. So they're saying the Federal right here that we're deprived of is a Sixth Amendment right to -- to counsel, period. There are a lot of different bases for it. There are a lot of different things that happen, but that's the single ground or right or, in this case, issue doesn't change the word of -- that it used to mean. So call it this one thing. It's so simple, and at that point, let the court of appeals deal with it. As soon as we try to separate different bases for saying that this was a deprivation of the right to counsel, we are going to produce a pretty good nightmare because they shade into each other often. They're related in a variety of ways. They may be or may not be related through the prejudice problem. And lawyers will start wondering when they have to file a court cross-appeal, and we will create a -- a mess. So that's the basic argument, I think, of this brief, and it is one of the arguments that they're trying to make. Now, what is your simple, clear answer to that?
13-7451 +++$+++    They never meant to --   Isn't  isn't there a normal obstruction of justice statute that existed before this?   Suppose, in other words, it -- wasn't this going to a criminal -- isn't a criminal matter?   Wasn't what the official, the government official was investigating a minor crime, catching fish that are too small? Am I right?   It's a civil offense.   Fine. Then isn't there a statute that says that you cannot destroy evidence useful for a civil offense when you know that it's going to be?   In other words, for many, many years before Sarbanes-Oxley, the Federal Government could not prosecute obstruction of justice.   Where there was a civil offense involved?   No, I'm not asking specific things. I want to know the general criminal law, which I do not know all of it. I had always thought there is a crime called obstruction of justice, and I always thought that a person who destroys evidence, where he knows it's evidence, he's been asked to bring it to the proceeding which may not yet have taken place, he purposely destroys it, I had thought that that was a 0 crime.   But it was never was in the criminal system? No one was ever prosecuted for it?   What statute did you used to use?   Okay, okay. I guess I can look that up later. But in any case, this is a -- what will you do with the problem that I put together? That is my problem.   Yeah.   I mean, somebody comes to the door and says -- I've been through this. He passes a piece of paper through the door. It's the postal -- it's a postman. He says, please send this back. It's our proper duty to deliver the mail. I say, I hate postmen and I rip it up. 20 years. (Laughter.)   And why wouldn't it happen? It wouldn't happen because you'd never prosecute it, though I've had my doubts recently. (Laughter.)   Yes, I do. I say, I hate postmen. I don't want them to find out. And I tell four people, I finally got even with the postman. I have -- I have the intent. And I'm using a ridiculous example purposely because, by using an example purposely, I'm trying to get you to focus on the guestion of how possibly to draw a line. And if you can't draw a line, it seems to me that the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is a real one. And if that's a real risk, you fall within the vagueness doctrine. There is the whole problem spelled out, and what I do not understand is the relation of this case to that doctrine or how to decide this case.   Yes.   How do I know since there could be four ways of trying to limit it? And one way to try to limit it might be what your opponent says.   That's true.   What about every camper --   All right. So if that's so, then that's the dilemma. Suppose I worry about Justice Alito's single fish in the case of a camper who kicks an ember away, knowing you shouldn't have built the campfire or picks a flower, knowing you're supposed to let wildflowers blossom. What about that 20 years, and you could multiply those beyond belief. So if that's the problem, does his client go to prison because we've just assumed that problem away from the case?   How -- how do we handle it if, as you say, there is a genuine concern in that respect, but it wasn't argued here?
13-854 +++$+++    What do we do when there's a bus accident on a technical thing and different people who were injured sue in different places at different times? Same problem, isn't it?   Same problem. I mean, you can think of a thousand cases like that where -- where you have a big bus accident, technical problem with the motor, different place -- people from different places who are victims and they sue in different places at different times. Juries or tried to the bench, they could reach different factual conclusions.   All right. So what do we do --   Right.   Yeah, I was actually curious what we did, because I can think of examples in antitrust, I can think of examples in corporate law, I can think of examples versus every area of the law, where often it does happen, as the Chief Justice says, it could -- the different factual things have enormous public implications. What I was interested in and asked because I wanted to know, what are the legal devices for dealing with that?   I think that Markman just dealt with judge/jury, not which court gets the fact up -- decides the facts basically, which is where I do start. So if you want to -- but if I take that as a given, then I'd say why should you treat fact matters here any different than any other case. The main reason for letting the district judge, I've always thought, decide facts as an initial matter in a technical case is because there are all kinds of facts, you know. We happen to have some particularly odd definitional ones here, but there are all kinds of facts. In technical cases, there are all kinds of facts. And the traditional reason is you've seen the witnesses -- but there is one thing he's done that the -- that the court of appeals has not done, and in a technical case, it seems to me that makes an enormous difference. He sat there the whole time and listened to these experts talk.   And that, I think, is a very powerful reason for saying in a technical case, don't overturn the judge's factual findings whether they are -- particularly scientific matters, but no particularly here -- unless those three judges who will not even read the whole record normally and certainly won't hear those witnesses, don't let them do it unless they are convinced that it is clearly erroneous. Now, that's the argument, and I would like to say that's different from a statute.   Whether or not it is different from the -- it's different from -- it's the same as any technical case. Now, why is this different?   But I mean, that same thing, as we know, could happen in dozens of -- of technical cases.   And you go on importance, I could make up some important hypotheticals. You want trivial ones, I'll make some of those. You want to put a definition on a thing, fine. You know, we can all both -- and you're probably better than I am at it. And you say is that the only answer that patents are somehow different?   But normally, normally is not difficult to distinguish the one from the other. Sometimes it is. But in the cases where it isn't, which I think are vast, did that dial read 7? I have 4 witnesses who said it did, and I have 3 witnesses who said it read 5. And now let's complicate that, but it all has to do with what happened in a laboratory at a particular time. Are we going to have the 3 people from the Federal Circuit going in and second-guessing the judge without giving him any weight on that kind of factual question, which I suspect, I have no reason to believe it won't, will turn up comparatively just as often?   I want the answer. I want the answer.   What happened in --   I mean, it isn't that I like it better. It is that Rule 52(a) says that fact-finding of the district court should be overturned only for clear error. And once I start down this road, well, that's true on some facts and not other facts, and -- and I get into this. See, I'm not an expert. I don't see where the stopping place is. I don't see how to manage the system and I am moved by the fact that the lawyers here are pretty much -- who know patent law are pretty much in favor of district courts as far as amici are concerned. They're pretty much in favor of district courts making the fact-finding. So -- so I don't think where to go to start drawing the lines you want to draw.   I don't know. Rule 52(a) and that's the -- what do I do about that?   How many patents do they issue a year, do you have any rough idea?   How many patents are issued every year? Roughly. Do you have any idea?   All right. That may be true, but what you -- and I know I'm not going to get an answer from you, because I know what the answer would be.   My question is, where are we going if we start carving out one aspect of the patent litigation, namely the construction, and say that fact matters underlying that, root facts, even when they are one witness versus another, are for the court on review to decide, but in all other matters, they're really clear error. I don't know where I'm going with that, because I'm not an expert in this area. But you see that I'm nervous about it?   Oh, you've seen the figures in here. The figures are they followed the path and they reverse non-stop and it's, like, 30 percent or 40 percent of all the cases get reversed.
13-894 +++$+++    No. But the statute -- the statue other than the FOIA exemption 3 language doesn't talk about when a matter is kept secret by statute, as opposed to by regulation. So given that it's all tied in together, it's very tempting to say, I'll tell you when it's a statute rather than a regulation. And then you go and read the -- the exemption 3 and you say it's a statute when, 1, it leaves no discretion on the issue, or 2, it establishes particular criteria for withholding; or three, it refers to particular types of matter. So we look at the statute to see if it does that. That's what I thought I was supposed to do, to decide whether it's the statute that's doing it or the regulation. And the one that gives me the most trouble on those three is the last one, because it does seem to refer to a particular type of matter, though in very general terms. But so what do you think of what I've just said?   I see that. I see that. You'd have to say critical infrastructure facilities are on one side of the line. This is on the other. Now, what about the analysis I just went through? What do you think of that? Is that the correct legal analysis, in your opinion?   In your view you don't even need the President. In your view, the President wouldn't get involved because you have to have a very specific statute. That's your view.   I know that. I'm just saying but you don't even get into it because it was in a regulation and not in a statute. And if it's not in a statute, then you don't even get into that.   Congress -- I mean, I know people don't want to bring this up. But actually the staffs of congress do consider these problems. They write them down. They say what the answer is and the members are informed. Now, in this particular case, if you happen to read the conference reports, you get the answer. It says, what does it mean not specifically prohibited by law? And then in both the House report and the Senate report, it tells you, go back to what we passed two years ago, namely, the FOIA exemption, and that's what it means. And so that's why I got the thought that maybe that is what it means. And once you have that thought, you then see the country isn't going to fall apart because they wrote in the presidential exemption as well. So reading what the staffs actually wrote, perhaps I'm biased in that respect, believing that the members of Congress do think about these problems through staff, we have the answer to this case leaving only open whether it is specific enough or not, and you make an argument that it's too general. Now, why shouldn't I follow that approach?   There are three reports. One is really for you, and that's the conference report. The Senate report is somewhat against you because it picks up the FOIA -- or the FOIA exemption, and says that's what this means, even though you don't want to do that and --   -- I would read all of them, the House report, too.   I think I'm talking about the report on the Whistleblower Act.   And the report on the Whistleblower Act, which it came two years after FOIA, the Senate committee said, "Those disclosures which are specifically exempted from disclosure by a statute which reguires that matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or by a statute which establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld." That is word for word.   You might be right about that, but what's bothering me is the more general guestion of driving an interpretive wedge between the FOIA exemption and the Whistleblower Act. I mean, that's going to get everybody good and mixed up, I think.   Yeah, but which in your opinion is the wiser way to go about it? I mean, assuming that this statute is not specific enough, which is the better way to go about it? To say the Whistleblower Act is special or to say interpret them both alike?
13-895 +++$+++    Suppose we, I don't know, I want to know what you think about the practicalities of sending this back. Assume -- assume in the back of my mind just relying on State policy is this. A State legislator gets up and says, in our State, there's a history of discrimination against black people. There are very few black representatives in this body. I would like to find a way of drawing district lines so that we have a few more. Okay? That's the normal way this case comes up. This is an obverse and odd situation. All right. I don't know that that statement should automatically disqualify his plan. Maybe we should look a little further into it and see what they actually did. Suppose I start there. And then I say, okay, you go proceed district by district. I suspect they will be able to prove that at least in some districts, at least in some, the statement of the legislator here did prevail and did make a difference. Now, if that's so, they don't have Section 5 to rely on as a defense. So I don't know what the defense is possibly going to be. And since we can't even think what the defense is, why don't they just redo this plan over in the legislature and save everybody a lot of time and trouble. What's your response to that?   So my point of my question is you want to go to that lot of trouble before a lot of extra trouble in court proceedings, or do you want to go to that trouble right off the bat and get it over with? I expect you'd have an answer to that, and I'm not taking a point of view. I just want to know what your response is.   Of course you don't, but my question is, is there going to be a defense left that could stop you from having to go back?   What?   You'd look at the -- you'd look at the complaint, when I look at the complaint, I suspect I'll find something about districts. It's certainly true that, sort of taking the US point of view, the -- it's quite clear the -- to me anyway, that the court decided on the basis of a statewide plan. So if it's wrong about that, then they ought to have a chance to go back and make their claim district by district and have a decision on that basis.
13-9026 +++$+++    The problem -- the problem is there is a set of cases where you can think it's serious and a set of cases where you just think it isn't. The bank robbery -- there are more in the bank are the ones that concern me that it isn't. The bank robbers are in the bank, there are a couple of other customers walk in and one of them says will you please walk over here with me for a second. Okay? They walk two feet to get him out of the way. That doesn't sound as if that is a lot worse than pistol whipping somebody. And you can multiply those cases. And what is worrying me about it is, since it's a mandatory minimum, the prosecutors have a choice about whether to -- to indict or not on that ground, and a person who is coming in and who is represented and -- what is his choice? You know, you either plead guilty or I put this in, too, because you moved one of the customers 10 feet. Now, that's -- that's the -- it's the -- that's the nature of the mandatory minimum which is disturbing and calls, I think, for some kind of lenity when there is openness of interpretation. But on the other hand it's very hard for me to distinguish how to separate the cases that seem comparatively trivial taking place within the bank from the ones where you really are injecting fear, special fear, into the mind of the person who is told to accompany you, and that could take place even if it's like one foot, because he's been singled out. Okay. Is there any way to do it? Is there any way that you could reassure me that in these lesser cases this will not be used as an instrument towards a guilty plea or an instrument where these minor things that he's been talking about nonstop, your brother over here, that they'll certainly turn out to be charged routinely?   He wouldn't say, would you please step over here?   Step over there or I'll blow your head off is what he says.   My -- my example was meant to encompass a polite, but armed, bank robber. (Laughter.)   Well, of that -- why don't we say that? Say that what this statute covers is forcible abduction, and there we are. That's not perfect. But it's -- at least my polite but armed bank robber who asks the person to move over hasn't abducted him and in many of these de minimis cases there won't be an abduction. Why not just pick up those words and say indeed, the government uses that when it explains it.   Well, but you could say de minimis did because of the language that you point to, accompaniment. That's what I criticized you earlier as just being too vague. But where movements are small, this is -- where movements are small -- in considering de minimis you can consider that where movements are small, the absence or presence of the kind of fear that is connoted by the word abduction, which -- that's a little tough. But I see your point there. But the alternative is just this sort of vast discretion in bank robbery cases where -- where there has been nothing more like an inch or it really had nothing to do with the abduction concern and the distances were miniscule.   Would you admit that?   Yes, that's true.   Well, 95 or -- over 90 percent of all the criminal charges in the country are pleaded guilty. Isn't that the right number, something like that?   And certainly you do read lots of criticisms of people pleading guilty because they are afraid that in the absence of the guilty plea the sentence will go way up. I don't know how true that is, I haven't seen the studies, but I'm certainly familiar with literature that says that.
13-935 +++$+++    So you're just saying that they didn't decide it correctly, but it's terribly easy to imagine a different debtor who goes into bankruptcy and he lists Item 1, 2, 3, and 4. And the creditors come in and say, you know, it's awfully surprising, four or five, six months ago I have a similar list you gave to the National Bank, and it had 10 items on it. What happened to 6 through 10? Ah, the debtor replies, oh, they didn't really belong to me. Why not? Because State law gives it to somebody else because State law is the source of all property law. And they say, no. And now we have a dispute. So forget about the trust. Maybe I don't see why that's special. This is simply a question of whether a bankruptcy judge can litigate who owns Items 6 through 10, and one party says State law gives them to my cousin Mary and the other party says State law gives them right to you. Now, if we say, no, and side with you on that one, what happens to the constitutional grant to Congress to make uniform laws of bankruptcy? I imagine it would still exist, but I can't imagine in what form. Now you see a pretty hostile argument, so I would like to hear your reply. (Laughter.)   And what is the example of 6 through 10 that you could find that wouldn't involve the issue you have described? Because if there is a piece of property and the debtor is saying it isn't mine, it must be somebody's, and by definition it's not the creditor's, and so it must be somebody else's. And so that other person, if there is a dispute, will say it's mine. And therefore, isn't your answer to say to my property -- to my question, too bad, the bankruptcy trustee cannot litigate who owns 6 through 10?   Yes.   Yes, he can't do it. All right. Then we're back to where are we with bankruptcy courts, when you have taken from them the power to litigate what I would think is the most fundamental thing imaginable: How much money does the debtor have in cases where that is in dispute?   You said for thousands of years -- I got that point -- for thousands of years this has been the law. So can you think of any case -- I find it rather interesting, I'm reading about Henry II, who, in fact, created many of the laws of England. So from the time of Henry II onward, is there a case that you have found somewhere which said that the bankruptcy trustee or the bankruptcy judge cannot litigate who owns property, the bankrupt or someone else, in the state -- in the estate.   I'll read it. I'll read it.   Stern is a case of a third party and counterclaim, and there never would have been the money in the estate had it not been for the fact that the debtor in fact asserted a claim, a counterclaim against a claim that was being made by an outsider to the estate. It's not too hard to distinguish Stern. But I am saying other than Stern -- I don't even think Stern -- let's go back to Henry II. Maybe you have so many you'd have to send them on a list, but maybe not.   No argue -- so -- so where you have brought me so far is these cases say -- what they say is you have to -- you can't just grab it; you have to proceed under Section 23 and have a proceeding. But the -- the -- a proceeding -- some kind of a proceeding, I don't know exactly what that kind is, you probably do, but that doesn't mean the trustee doesn't get it. I mean, it's the trustee who litigates it out, it's the trustee who decides, but I don't know what a Section 23 proceeding is.   Yeah.   A plenary proceeding. But where does that take place?   It didn't take place before the bankruptcy judge?   Oh, I see the problem.   That's exactly -- because -- it's interesting. I mean, I've read the page you have there now with the cases. And I see you can -- the distinction will drive you towards that, not 100 percent, because there will be some instances of colorable -- colorable title and so forth, not 100 percent, but 99 percent, items 6 through 10 go to a different court. But what -- the constitutional question is the deepest one to me, is we do have a constitutional provision specifically giving to Congress the authority to create a uniform system of bankruptcy courts which have served our economy well, I think. That's what I read. Makes us richer. And on the other hand, we do have the question, as you point out, that this is determining a title where there are two people under State law contesting it. And so which prevails? And until I think Stern, it would have been Congress's delegation, maybe. And what is the strongest argument for not giving weight? These are sort of like administrative agencies defining -- you know, deciding things that never have been done before. What's the strongest argument? No, don't do it, it might gut the bankruptcy court, but don't do it. Or maybe you want to say it won't gut the bankruptcy court.   Yes, yes. I agree with you to this extent. It's either Stern marches forward or it's -- I'd say steps in place.   That's -- let me proceed with this question one more step. Every day of the week administrative agencies change State law. Every day of the week they change State law, even involving property. And in such a case, the question is whether -- has this administrative agency, under authority of Congress, changed State law affecting people's property rights in a way that deprives them of due process of law? Have they gotten fair procedure? And so is a possible answer to your problem: If the procedures of the bankruptcy court are fair when they litigate these questions of property right, the ! fact that they do affect State law and take property among persons switching it is not forbidden by the Constitution where it indeed is authorized as part of a uniform system of bankruptcy law?
13-975 +++$+++    So Congress passes a law. It says: You've got to have towers, I'm sorry, and the local community can stop it, but they can't stop it for one of three substantive reasons; and in addition, they have to show that their decision was rational, which is done -- or reasonable, which is done by having a record with substantial evidence. That's what this means to ( me. Now, your clients and others aren't used to being agencies, but they're being treated like agencies and, therefore, the simplest thing is to read this two things together, just what Justice Kagan said, write the decision and give your reasons because otherwise there is no way to know whether there's substantial evidence or not. It's in the same clause. It's in the same phrase. The words are right there. It says "decision supported by substantial evidence." I know -- that's, I think, the basic argument. The Solicitor General doesn't go that far, but if we don't have simplicity, we'll have 2 million different ways of going about this between different cities and counties.   But then you're agreeing with your opponents, it seems to me you. You have the document, the document says "denied," and there it gives the reasons for denying so people can see if there's substantial evidence. You're just saying it was the later document. They're saying it was the earlier document. I don't know.   But do you agree with them on that, that one document --   Well, I don't know if they should be called "the minutes." I'm not an expert on that area of city government. I don't know whether you want to call the document "minutes" or whether you want to call the document "written decision." That seems to me not before us, but what is before us is whether the decision has to have in it the reasons so that we can tell if it's supported by substantial evidence. You agree on that one?   Why -- why do we have to say? Why don't we take word for word almost what the -- what the court said? What this statute reguires is that there be a written denial -- well, we can forget whether it's separate or not -- describing the reasons for the denial and containing a sufficient explanation to permit the court to evaluate the evidence, period. Now, that's what the city has to do. And if they produce something that's a mess because it's a 98-page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out what it is, you'll get a decision like this. If, in fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny it, it won't be a problem.
13-983 +++$+++    But that's -- can you go back? That's exactly the point that is bothering me. I'm -- I'm with you down to forget the purpose. I'm with you there has to be a true threat; we'll assume that. And now the guestion is knowledge, and that's the general reguirement for mens rea where there's just a general -- that's the normal rule, knowledge. And you have to know those portions that make up an actus reus. You have to know the elements. One of the elements is a true threat. So I thought: What do you say you have to know there? And when I read your brief, you first said he has to know, he has to understand the meaning of the words he speaks in context and must intentionally speak them, and is showing that the defendant acted knowingly in transmitting a true threat reguires proof the defendant knew he transmitted a communication and he comprehended its context and context. Now, when I first read that -- you hear my clerks have disagreed with me -- I thought, well, that means he has to know that it is a true threat; i.e., that a reasonable -- why did I think that?   You just saw people being sworn in. Suppose someone comes from, I don't know, hears them say "I do, I do, I promise," does he know the meaning of the words? Unless he knows the action -- so a marriage is better. Someone who has never seen marriages hears the bride say, "I do." Has the person understood the meaning in context, in context of those words, if he doesn't know that that means they're married and go through a lot of legal proceeding? And similarly, can a person know the meaning in context of true threat unless he understands, just like the words "I do," what a true threat is.   In fear.   A reasonable person.   With knowledge. I mean, forget -- I mean, I want -- Justice Kagan and I were just trying to get you to focus very specifically, I think, on -- forget the First Amendment issue here. Take it to the side. Forget it. Let's look at ordinary Hornbook criminal law after the Model Penal Code. There the normal -- as you say in your brief -- reguirement is that the person know the elements of the offense. That's normal. If it is drugs, he has to know that this is a drug. If it is a threat of force, he has to know that he has a threat of force, I take it, or that it's a bank. So why shouldn't he, here, have to know what is an element of the crime; namely, that there is a true threat as so defined? Just Hornbook criminal law. Are we departing from it or not?   I agree with you, no specific intent. That is, you don't have to have it to be your purpose. That's why I use the Model Code term -- Model Penal Code terminology which, for me, is easier. You don't have to have it as your purpose. But you do have to know the elements of the offense. You have -- you agree with that, I think.   All right. You have to know what you're doing. What you are doing is you have to communicate a true threat.   Exactly. I -- I think that is the distinction. I -- I'm thinking that perhaps a lot of these cases would come up in domestic relations disputes and in such a case, the guestion would be -- because people get into heated arguments -- do you have to show the defendant used some words that, in context, would be taken as a true threat, or do you have to show that the defendant used some words that do have that characteristic and he knew that they had that characteristic? Now, if I'm right about this --  Hmm?   I know. You think the former --   -- and the real issue is, is it the former or the latter?   And the -- if it's totally open in the history and so forth, I think, you know, people do say things in domestic disputes that they are awfully sorry about later, and -- and where the person didn't know that he was saying something that a reasonable person would take as a threat --   I'm  I'm hesitating to say that Congress wanted or it makes sense to -- he is lacking something there. Maybe it's his fault that he is lacking it but he is.
13-9972 +++$+++    The problem -- I have a great idea. Why don't we say, taking your test, that the stop, you can -- you can do it, you know, whatever is normal there, but it cannot be prolonged more than the time reasonably reguired to complete the mission, which happens to be giving a temporary -- a traffic ticket. Or we could say it cannot last longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. What an original idea I had. It happens to be language from two cases that we've already said. And are you saying anything different? I don't think so. If so, what? And if not -- since this is a case where apparently the lower courts have said it did last longer than was reasonably necessary because the policeman said, that's why I -- I mean, in effect said, according to the judge -- Hey, I called the dog after the stop was over, or something like that -- we cite those two cases, say those are the tests. Affirm -- or reverse, I guess; QED. Good-bye, we say, to all the litigants, and hope that you are happy. Now, when -- when -- when I hear you say that it sound -- what you've said sounds -- sounds that's what you think we should do.   But I suspect you don't, but I want to know why.   It is the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop or it is the time that is reasonably reguired to complete the mission. We can't do better than that. How can we? We are not traffic policemen, and our experience on stops comes from, unfortunately, being the stoppee rather than the stopper.   Yeah.   Of course, if it's in the middle of it, you call the dog and so forth, but you can't prolong it beyond the time reasonably necessary. Now, I've said that several times. I think you may agree with that.   And then if you do agree with it, here, it was prolonged more than reasonably necessary -- at least that's what they found -- end of case. Now --   Yeah, that's right   There are a lot of problems --   There are a lot of problems with any rule based on reasonableness, and, of course, there will be difficult problems. But here we've said twice that once the stop is over, i.e., goes beyond the time reasonably necessary to complete the mission, you cannot call in the dogs; and before, you can. Now, of course there will be anomalies in that respect. Of course there can be bad-faith exercises. Of course there can be confusion as to which is which. But that's inevitable in the situation and we can't do anything about it. Now, what can you suggest that would just help us and show we could do something about it?   Well, it may be --   -- but I'm asking you what -- what is it that we could say better than the language of the two cases? I mean, I'm not -- I'm not denying there is a problem with what you just said; there is. You might do it -- decide to do this beforehand and do all kinds of excuses. You know, people every day of the week make up reasons, they go about -- but if you want a better rule than the one laid down in the two cases, what?   No, I don't think you have to do that. I mean, you know, you get into arguments about it; was it reasonably necessary or not? It's the cannot be prolonged beyond the time what is reasonably necessary. It is difficult sometimes --   -- to decide what is reasonably necessary.   What about   Okay. But that's where -- I thought that position that I've tried to -- let me state it more clearly, I think. It is unlawful to have the dog sniff where the dog sniff unreasonably prolongs the stop, is that -- does -- is that okay if I write -- with the government -- if I write those words in an opinion?   Ah. Well, how -- if the ticket-writing is over and there is nothing else to do and the policeman says, hey, this is over, at that point has it not unreasonably prolonged the stop if the sniff takes place afterwards?   Because?   Well, wait. Now, what about this? See, I see your problem is, you said, well, it can't prolong the stop, the traffic stop more than reasonably -- you know, it has to be -- take the time reasonably reguired to complete the mission. That's what it says, complete the mission. So we have the intermission prolongation, which has to be reasonable, and we have complete the mission. So complete the mission. Once the mission's completed, it's over. That's language from the opinion, too. Complete, complete. Good-bye. Over. At that point it becomes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.   Well, I see that. What about -- another aspect is I was seeing it the way Justice Kagan described it. And one virtue of that, now, but you may not think it does work, is administrative. What do you tell the police department? Say, well, when you're in traffic stops can you use dogs to sniff? Yeah, you can. But remember, once it's over, the traffic stop, it's over, done, finished. And by the way, if it isn't over yet, you still well may get into trouble if you've unreasonably prolonged the stop just to get the sniff. Now, that seems pretty easy to explain. It's fairly bright-line. And as soon as you get into this other -- you know, just leaving it totally open, there's no check, really, on the -- on the or not too much of one. What -- you -- now, I'm putting that to you to get your response.   No, I was saying two parts. Part one, traffic stoppers, you can use a dog sniff when you stop, but not once the stop is over, period, unless you have cause or something. And during the stop, that's part two, you can't prolong it but for a reason. You have to do it all within a reasonable time, okay? You can't unreasonably prolong it to get your dog in. See? You tell them those two things. Once you've told them the two things, they've got it in their heads. When this is over, good-bye dog.   When it's not over, they better be careful not to unreasonably prolong it. Now, they'll understand that, and it will be both protecting what the Fourth Amendment protects and also, I think, giving them enough leeway to conduct a traffic stop.   I think if I take what I said and take your answer, I have to say your answer is right. It's just a bad effect of my rule. And -- and the virtue of the, you know, the two-part rule is what we said was the virtue of it. And it's like in many cases; there just isn't much more to say. You have to say, am I willing to run this -- they might purposely change the seguence. They might, that's true. Somebody might. And I don't know what to do about that. The answer is I couldn't do anything about it.
14-103 +++$+++    On that theory, if  I mean, if -- if you're supposed to get some fees -- say, $100,000 -- and in that fee is -- is various risks of the extra money it'll cost to collect or the extra risk of you won't get it, you'll only get half and -- and you -- you set the rate at 100,000. And so now a different risk is eventuated -- namely, you had to go to litigation -- and that wasn't in the 100,000. Well, then, if it's reasonable and everything, why shouldn't it be? I mean, why is -- you're -- you're trying to, in that 100,000, give the employer something for their -- for their time and their effort and also compensate certain risks. And here was one that wasn't in the 100,00. It turned up later. But how would you draw a line between some and the other? I think that's the government's theory.   Well, no, of course, it doesn't exist -- you're guite right -- outside of bankruptcy. But now you're saying that the 100,000 does include all kinds of -- for various payments for things that might make it more expensive to get the money. And then what I don't see is saying some and not others.   And this is just one of them, I mean, the -- that you have to go into court and litigate, is just one of them. You wouldn't object, for example, if the fee -- the judge says, look. We're going to give the firm 120, why not 100? Well, you know, there are risks in this; and one of the risks is they're going to have to go to court and somebody will sue them and they have to go litigate that. So we'll give it to them upfront to pay for the risk, just as you pay for the risk of nonpayment.   Because?   No, no. It's -- it's not. Only -- actually, only 90 is. But it's reasonable compensation because 10 compensates for risks such as risks of nonpayment. Am I being clear? Do you see where I'm going?   All right.   Maybe this is not worth pursuing.   Well, all right, but if you ! look at the fee-shifting statutes, we looked up a lot, we found guite a few which say that the court can award a reasonable attorney's fee.   It's broader than here. But the words, basic active words are reasonable attorney's fees, and almost all of them have been interpreted to allow compensation for the reasonable fee. So they throw that in. And so, they're counting it as part of the reason -- they're counting it as part of a reasonable attorney's fees. And here, reasonable attorney's fee is the same. That language is the same.   A reasonable compensation.   There is a reasonable attorney's fee. But it's hard to make a lot out of that.   Yeah.   But that happens later, everything's closed and they discover that through some odd thing they have to spend $10,000 to get the $90,000 that was awarded to them. Any authority on that? You go back to court and say, Judge, I want $10,000 more. He says, But the case was closed. He says, Yeah, but I but to spend the $10,000 to get the $90,000. If there were such a case, one of you would have found it. Or somebody would have, I guess.   But there's no -- just under all these other statutes, there is so many attorney's fees statutes that --
14-114 +++$+++ 
14-15 +++$+++    I'm sorry. That just confuses me. Suppose you were for their approving a methodology that would end up with Dr. Smith getting $60. Okay? So what do -- why do you attack it? You approved it. If you wanted it, if you like -- you're saying they had a methodology, you approved it, you liked it. Now they apply it and he gets the $60, you think he should get 80. But I mean, how does this -- now I'm confused. !   Approved. Well, then, why didn't you just sue -- see, that's why -- look. You think -- the doctor says $80, I want 80, you have some statute in there that says 60. Okay. I'm suing you. There must be a whole set of rules that say when doctors get paid under this program. Probably half are State, half are Federal. So he brings a suit under those rules; and when they come to the number that's there, they say, I'm so sorry, but that number has been preempted by the Federal determination under this statute. Now, why is -- well, I can't get away from that because I don't see why that -- I don't understand what's wrong with what I'm saying.   There's no set of rules that allows the doctor to say -- in other words, it's not the State that pays the doctor? Who pays the doctor?   Let me try once more. I did understand all these molecules. I ought to be able to understand this. I don't know if I can. Maybe I'll put it this way. This is how it always seemed to me it should work, but apparently it can't. I'm a doctor, I want $80. Under the -- under the -- under the rules of California, I can go ask for 60. So I follow all those rules, I file my claim, and when it comes to the number, I put 80 instead of 60. All I did was change the 8 to the 6. And the defense says, hey, you shouldn't have changed the 6 to the 8. I say I did that because the 6, that number 6, is preempted by this language in Section 30 of the Federal thing, and I think, though it doesn't tell you, it should be 8, okay? Now I've got my preemption into the case. If the district judge agrees with me, he's going to make a point. He's going to say: We can't have 500 different judges deciding whether it should be an 8 or a 3 or a 5 or some other thing. Don't worry; there's a doctrine called primary jurisdiction; go ask the agency what to do. And the agency will either tell you, hey, there's no problem with the 8, or it will have a hearing or it will submit a brief. It will do something and everything will work out. We'll get there. But now, there's lots wrong with what I just said. Maybe you can't even know where to begin. But insofar as you can shed some light on it, I would be helped.   There used to be a fairly well established doctrine at the Civil Aeronautics Board, of blessed memory, and the -- the -- they'd sometimes get briefs, sometimes they'd send the parties over. There were ways of doing it. Now, that doctrine I don't think is too live, and if -- so maybe you shouldn't go on. Just leave me to try to do my best.   That's not the problem, the problem -- that's -- I mean, that underlying this is what's bothering me, that you have a very strong case, in your view, that there is a number, the number is produced by CMS methodology, they just didn't follow it. And, therefore, all the relief you need is tell them follow the Federal rule, which is CMS period. But if your suit is allowed, I do not see how you distinguish -- let's say there are 5 million medical procedures. Each has a cost. There are 500 judges. And 500 times 5 million is an awful lot of numbers and they will conflict with each other. And how do we get some coherence out of this? Although you've solved the problem here, we can't close the door to everybody else if we open it to you. So how is that problem solved? That's why I was harping on primary jurisdiction, et cetera. But what I'm looking for is the solution to the problem the Chief Justice brought up.   You're saying it's clearly right under the law because of CMS that we should get $80. Clearly right. Now, for a variety of reasons, we can't just go into court and say, give us the 80. But what we want to do is reverse it. Ask that the Federal law preempts the State's reason for not giving us the 80, namely, that statute. Is that right? That's the form of this suit?
14-86 +++$+++    Actually, I didn't think that was the question. I thought the question presented was that the Tenth Circuit had said, Employer, unless you know from the woman who is applying, from the applicant, unless you receive direct, explicit notice that what she wants to wear is based on religion and she wants an accommodation, unless you receive direct, explicit notice from her, you're home free to do what you want. Now, in their question presented, they say, in the last few words in describing it, we think that's wrong. Now, I agree that we have to say whether that's wrong and, if it is wrong, it would be helpful to say what they have to do. So the SG says, here is what it is. If the employer correctly infers, correctly understands, and I would add "or correctly believes" that a practice is religious and an accommodation is necessary, that's it. Then he has to accommodate unless he has one of the excuses under the statute, et cetera. Okay. What's wrong with that?   It is  it is unadministrable to say that if the employer believes, thinks, this woman is religious and needs an accommodation and he's right, well, do something unless you have an excuse. What -- why is that unadministrable?   Oh no, you have to prove. This -- this is correct. You have to prove he has a belief. Now, we probably in 250,000 Federal cases a year, of those, say, 80,000 that go to trial. Proving that somebody has a belief or other is probably at issue in 90 percent of them. Now, I'm making that up, that number, but nonetheless, I don't think it's uncommon in the law that you have to prove that somebody believes something. So we say, the standard of proving belief is like in any other case.   Again, how we get into all that, if you want to add something to it, it seems we're in a kind of minutia. What's wrong with saying if he correctly believes that she's religious and needs accommodation, fine, that's the end of it. You're in the statute and prove an excuse. Correct belief can arise in a thousand contexts. Did he correctly believe that the drug that was being sold, that white powder, was heroin? Did the manager whom you're trying to fire and is saying you did, did he correctly believe that, in fact -- or didn't pay enough for college graduates? Did he correctly believe that this applicant graduated from Princeton? Did he -- that's Abercrombie -- did he correctly believe that -- that he had authority under the -- under the delegation of agency, to sign a check? I mean, look, there are thousands of things. What's -- why is it our job here to say what the right way of proving correct belief is? I mean, I think, we can say it's something wrong. You don't have to formulate your correct belief just because she told you. I mean, you can argue that one. That's the only way to prove it and I'm open to that argument, I'd like to hear it. But once we're beyond that, if I'm right that that isn't the only way you can prove correct belief, why do we have to say?   I'm with you with "suspect."   I'm with you only where they correctly believe that, dah, dah, dah, or understand dah, dah, dah, or no. Those three things seem good enough to me. Now, I've repeated this three times, but I want to hear the answer why they're not good enough.   Okay. So -- so the traceable -- now you've got me sort of interested in this -- it seems to me, when you mean traceable to the woman, I mean, you mean it loosely, I guess.   It's pretty hard to think of a case where it wouldn't be. I mean, I guess I could imagine a case that he found out about this woman from an FBI agent who was making it up. But, I mean, that just seems very, very unlikely.   And the applicant's reference didn't know the applicant?   Okay. There it is, traceable to the --   Okay. I got you. Is this right? I've got, I think, your argument. Your argument is it may sound odd to want a special rule as to when you have belief or so forth, but for administrative reasons, we have to have it. There are millions of people who are practicing one religion or another where you get a clue of that from their name or maybe their dress or whatever it is. And whenever we have such a person applying, if she doesn't say anything or he doesn't say anything, and we don't hire them or we don't do it, we're going to get sued. And we don't want all those lawsuits. And it isn't that big a burden to say to the person who wants the accommodation, tell us. We get into some administrative rule about how to elicit it from her without that simple rule, tell us, we're going to be in a real administrative rat mess getting sued left right and center. Have I got the essence of your argument?   Okay.   Well, that isn't the end of the world, perhaps. But you would say, look, we -- we have thousands of managers and -- and goodness knows they're going to get -- start getting resentful and dah, dah, dah, dah. I mean, I just want to be sure I've got the argument.
