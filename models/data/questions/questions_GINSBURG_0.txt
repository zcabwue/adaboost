04-1034 +++$+++              So where would you -- where would -- where would you put the line?             But then -- but you were -- you are including at least wetlands that abut --               -- navigable water.               What about major tributaries?               Which ones?               Well, is your position no tributaries or some tributaries?        From everything -- from everything you said, it sounds like you're -- you're taking issue with Riverside Bayview because if a wetland adjacent to the river counts, then why not a stream that goes right into it?               What sense does that distinction make?        You think that's correct about what the Court said in Bayview when it phrased the question as before discharging fill material into wetlands adjacent to navigable bodies of water and their tributaries.        That's what the Court thought it was deciding in Riverside Bayview.        At any rate, they could not have been making the distinction Justice Scalia suggested if, at least in the Court's thinking, the tributaries rolled right into the navigable body.        Then what was the reason they gave for rejecting the permit?        Suppose --        May I ask one question about your -- your not -- no hydrological connection? If this berm were next to a wetland that would otherwise be adjacent to a river, the situation that was presented in Riverside Bayview, is it the berm that prevents there being a hydrological connection?        So it could -- there could be a situation where the wetlands would be right next to the river, but there's a berm in between, and that would break the hydrological connection?           We're told that one of them was much closer.           What about the Pine River? Are you -- that's not 20 miles away, is it?           Do you know?       The -- the Solicitor General represented to us that it was very close.       Are you disputing that as a matter of fact?
04-10566 +++$+++               And at least you have the authority of the International Court of Justice that says this is a right.             This is not just a matter between the states.              How many times now has the ICJ said that this convention confers rights on the individual?                And what is the view of our treaty partners on that issue?                Not at the time this treaty came into force.                Not at the time the Vienna Convention came into force.                We were almost alone in having suppression as the remedy.              You don't think that the -- that the remedy that the ICJ imposed in the case where the United States was before it as a party, that that would be the appropriate remedy?                       It was not suppression.             It was reconsider this, taking account of the failure to notify and what might have happened if notice had been provided.          But there wasn't any word in either of the ICJ judgments, if I recall them correctly, that said, United States, you have a suppression remedy, so you should suppress.          But we do know, don't we, Mr. Gartlan, that if the treaty had been followed, it still would have been permissible for the police, having given Miranda warnings, to commence interrogation?           The treaty does not require that the enforcing officials in this country immediately call the foreign consulate.             Isn't that so?          Promptness.   And I think that the United States has told us it's generally done here somewhere between 24 and 72 hours.                 A suspect who has been given Miranda warnings as here -- the conversation with the police, the interrogation, could begin before that 24 hours or 72 hours expires.          Yes.        But in this case, wasn't it true that the trial counsel knew about the Vienna Convention right and, for whatever reason, thought his client would not be aided by talking to the Honduran counsel -- consul.            Well, the problem at the trial level, I think, is you would be -- you couldn't make it at that stage because it's the very lawyer who's ineffective.             Here, it was raised by a new counsel on appeal, and that's really the first opportunity it could come up because the -- the lawyer who didn't give this advice certainly isn't going to say, in -- in the course of the trial, I was ineffective.             So -- and that's I think the point that the ICJ was trying to make when it said you couldn't use the procedural default rule.
04-1067 +++$+++            I thought she said she came to collect her belongings.                That didn't sound like she's intending to stay very long.          But isn't it relevant what the status of the person is?                Someone might not know -- the police might not know that someone on the premises is a temporary visitor.          She called --          -- the police, didn't she?      She called the police to come.          But we --          But all of this is really getting pretty far from what I think is really the key question in the case.          Matlock is decided.        And Matlock said -- it referred to the risk that a joint occupant undertakes, the risk of inability to control access during one's absence.              So, the scene in Matlock is: one occupant is there, the other is absent; and the one who was absent assumes the risk that the one who was there will exercise control.                   Matlock doesn't speak to the two people who are in disagreement situation.               So, you would distinguish -- in your answer to Justice Souter -- this is -- this is a lawyer.              One room in the house is devoted -- is his office.               Her permission wouldn't extend to that room, would it?          Would they, on -- in -- on these facts -- I thought not, but perhaps I was wrong -- the -- when the police come to the house, they don't suspect anything about cocaine.                 Wife then accuses husband of being a cocaine user.                 So, that's the first information the police have.                 Could they get a warrant, just on her say-so?               In fact, they got the straw that had the cocaine residue on it.                 They went to the magistrate with that straw, and he gave them a warrant.         But if they had nothing but the wife's accusation, "He -- he's a cocaine user," would that amount to probable cause?
04-1084 +++$+++            Mr. Kneedler --           Mr. --           -- Mr. Kneedler, I think everyone would concede that there is a compelling interest, governmental interest, to have the Controlled Substances Act on that level, yes.                   But then, Congress has passed another statute that says all laws shall be subject to RFRA -- shall be subject to RFRA.                       So, we can't just look at "Is there a compelling State interest for the controlled Substances Act?" in a vacuum.                       We have to take what was a later statute, RFRA, to which the Controlled Substances Act is made subject by Congress.                       And I thought the argument was: Is there a compelling State interest in that context?             How can there be, given the situation with peyote and, "We're just like the Native American Church in that regard"?              I would understand that if the Government had acted uniformly.                    But we do have two situations that seem to be like -- the peyote and this case.       And if the Government must accommodate to one, why not to the other?        But, Mr. Kneedler, may I --        -- may I stop you --        -- there?      Because, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was my impression that the DEA was allowing an exemption for peyote use by the Native American Church before Congress passed the law.        But if you take it that the Government was right -- before Congress passed the law, the Government was right to give the exemption to allow that ceremonial use of peyote, then I don't see how you get mileage from a congressional act that was passed later than Congress's is saying, "Executive, we agree with you, you did right."           But it's not -- you -- I don't see how you can rely on the congressional statute when the Government was doing this even without a --          -- congressional statute.          Mr. Kneedler --          -- may Congress, consistent with the Establishment Clause, say that we will create an exception for peyote, but not for this other church, which has far fewer members, less risk of diversion, has been found to be a genuine religion?                 The problem of preferring one religious group over another, it seems to me, arises once there is an exception for the Native American Church. And I heard you say, "Well, the Indian tribes are special," but is that -- that's it.                      It would have to be --         May I -- may I ask you one question about the procedural posture of this case?                 This is an appeal from a preliminary injunction.              That's how it got here.          And we have been discussing, mostly, the case just as though it had been a permanent injunction.               The -- there are pieces of this case, like the Treaty and what it allows and doesn't allow, that -- where the record is so thin.       Is there a way of dealing with this case so there is the full airing that it never got, without resolving, at this point, other issues --         -- you've been debating?        But they were --        Well --        So --         Mr. --         -- Kneedler, if you prevail, would there be anything left over to be argued about in the -- for permanent injunction?
04-1131 +++$+++             I thought your position, Ms. Karlan, was that he doesn t even have to ask the union.       Justice Breyer is presenting a scenario where he asks the union and the union says we ve got better things to do with our money.          But I think your position is he doesn t have to ask at all.                He can go directly into Federal court under 1331.          Why not?     Because my -- when I first looked at this, I thought, well, this is the kind of thing that should have been -- should have been resolved at the grievance level, it shouldn t have even have to get to arbitration if he s right.                  He wants a survey to see if he s being picked on.                If he is, there would be redress.                So it seemed like this was the kind of complaint that was best handled in that kind of procedure.
04-1140 +++$+++              What about the plaintiff who waits over a year to move for remand when it appears as though the case is going in the defendant's favor?            Doesn't "may" give a district court discretion to say, "I'm not going to reward a plaintiff, who wants to go back to State court only when he was on the brink of losing in Federal court, with fees."             Just -- you say that your presumptive fees are included would cover that case.       It, in part, is -- resembles your case, because you didn't move to remand until the case was pending in the Federal District court for over a year.          Was it a big issue when the provision did not provide for counsel fees?          When it --          -- when the statute provided for costs --          -- which, in our system, do not include counsel fees, was it a big issue when all that was included was costs?             Why?   Under your rule, there's a presumption.              I thought that the rule you're asking us to approve is the one that's applicable in the Seventh Circuit, which is that you presume there will be counsel fees when a case is remanded to the State court, unless there are extraordinary circumstances that would overcome the presumption.              Now, that's what you're -- that's the rule you're asking for?               But there's such a different in the context.                 The Title VII plaintiff gets fees after a defendant has been found a law- violator.          And, here, a defendant has a right to access to a Federal court.                  And the statute -- you are emphasizing text.               If one looks at the Omnibus Act out of which this provision came, we see two removal-friendly pieces in it, right?                       Because, no longer do you have to verify a removal petition; you just do a simple notice.                 And that's one.        And there was another.              Oh, yes.    Yes, you don't have to put up a bond anymore if you want to remove.            Why --             -- not, then, just say "objectively reasonable basis to remove"?                       That's a one -- one standard.          If the law was so anti- removal, then one would expect there would be some kind of threshold check once you get to district court.        But the removal process is: you file your notice that you're removing.              That's it.   There it goes.       And the district court doesn't do any kind of initial screening to let it in.               It just gets there --          -- by rapid transit.
04-1144 +++$+++          But, your opinion -- that's the real problem here for the doctor who is on the line.          And you said the lawyer would say, oh, you've got this defense of -- what do you call it harm --          Competing harms, a defense -- I think that a lawyer who cares about his client would say, defense is not what we want.                 What we want is there is no claim, not that you have to put up a defense and maybe the attorney general will give us a letter saying that we come under that defense. Wouldn't a careful lawyer say, what you need to be protected is that there is no claim for doing what you're doing?           How would it be as-applied?           Look at your reply brief at page 3.       And you've made it very clear, and I think that it is helpful that you did, that there could be this pre-enforcement action by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring the suit. You've talking about this small category of cases, but I take it from what you have read -- what the lines I've just read, that you envision a doctor who says, sooner or later, I'm going to have such a case.                Right now, I don't know and I can't know until it's too late to come to any court, so I'm going to bring this pre-enforcement which you characterized as-applied.                   But I don't see how its as-applied, if if the physician just says, as you put it, I don't have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency to bring this suit.                So what is the relief, what is the lawsuit that you envision would be proper?             Could you do that as a class action?             What is the circumstance?             All you said here is there coule be a pre-enforcement challenge by doctors who would not have to wait until faced with an actual medical emergency.             Yes, exactly.         Then I think what you're saying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned with this category, wanted to give pre-enforcement relief to the physician, so what they did was write except that they should have said this statute is not enforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health and it cannot be applied in any such cases.               Where there is a risk to the health, then the statute is okay.            You've used this word severance now twice.            Severance is I excised a clause from the statute, but you're not asking for that.                    It's not severance.            There is no provision to be severed here.       It's putting a caret mark and adding something to it.      Not taking out any provision, but putting in an additional provision.             The end of the statute doesn't say that.            The end of that provision says sever a provision.             General Clement, there is usually great caution on the part of the Court from tampering with the statute.                    So excision is one thing.        You just drop a provision.               That's not possible here.       The Court has been extremely reluctant about caret marks, which is what -- there is no problem with what the legislature did.            It just didn't do enough.           So the court would have to add a provision.                   Not subtract.    There is nothing to subtract.             There's an addition and courts have been reluctant to do that.                 They feel much more comfortable cutting something out than putting something in.             Nobody asked them to do anything other than that.
04-1152 +++$+++             General --           General --           -- Clement, do I understand, with respect to that brief that offered a statutory interpretation to avoid a constitutional question, your answer is, that would be an unreasonable interpretation of the statute that we now have?                 And if we're talking about a predecessor statute in 1968, from the Vietnam days, that -- this would have been a highly academic question, because there weren't any such policies in any law schools with respect to recruiting.            That would --            -- be rather farfetched. The pitch that's being made is an equality pitch, that we are teaching our students equality, the equal stature of all people.             So, I think that your example does not fit --          General Clement, can you be affirmative now?         Because we have an example, from Justice Stevens, which is the Yale example.                 The -- it was the main campus, instead of the law school.                  What - - the recruiter is there.            He's in the same room that other recruiters use.          What can the law faculty do to disassociate itself from -- to say that, "We don't tolerate discrimination of any kind"?                  What can the law school do, concretely, while the recruiter is in the room?          Does it compel the speech of a private actor when the Government says, "Colleges and Universities, you are not going to get Federal money if you discriminate on grounds of race or gender. And we don't care what your private attitude may be, we will refuse to contract, we will debar you from future contracts, if you don't -- not only say, 'We won't discriminate,' but have an affirmative action plan."        You know that is not hypothetical.         This was the U.S. policy in the early '70s.
04-1170 +++$+++           If I -- if I understand what the situation is, there is no death penalty in Kansas as a result of this decision.          Has there been any movement in the legislature to change the law so you won't be in this situation where there is no death penalty?
04-1186 +++$+++              Mr. Frey, in practice, is there, as there often is for a corporation, a divergence between those two places?                      You have many corporations incorporated in Delaware with their principal place of business, say, in Michigan. In the case of a national bank, is there that similar difference that what you call its main office or where it's chartered is different from where it has its principal place of business?             Mr. Frey, remind me of the State bank.           A State bank is, for Federal diversity purposes, a citizen of two -- two places or only one?               So it would be the --               -- its place of incorporation and --               -- principal place of business if it's different.             In a venue statute, as opposed to a subject matter jurisdiction statute, the venue means where, where -- what particular court. Subject matter jurisdiction is which court system. They're entirely geared to entirely different things.            What about its principal place of business if it's different from its main office?            Principal place of business.            So the main office is it, like 1332 before the '58 amendment.              But you did say 1332(c) does not apply to the national bank.                       It's only one location.
04-1203 +++$+++             General Clement, in two respects, it -- I think you have addressed the cost concern by comparing, in your brief, the Federal experience, which is subject to these controls, and you said it wasn't an inordinate expense, but you also pointed out that every State prison system is subject to the Rehabilitation Act, because they get Federal funds.        Is there a difference between the obligation that State systems would have under the Rehabilitation Act and under the ADA?          And the --          -- damage remedies available under the Rehabilitation Act is --          Damages are available?            It applies -- it applies to State prisons, as well, because of its Spending --            -- Clause legislation.
04-1244 +++$+++                Yes, but there was a theory that was put to the jury -- and it's right there on the special interrogatories -- one category was violent acts that obstruct commerce with no connection at all to extortion.          That was there.            And I have a question about your characterization of what the Seventh Circuit did.                            It was puzzled.              It says, "Extortion, they all go."             But here are these four that don't involve extortion, and there's no ruling from the Court on those.                     Was the Court supposed to assume that the Court made a question -- decided a question of statutory interpretation by silence?         The question is whether the Court should rule on it, as in a matter of first decision. We are a Court of review.             There was no determination of whether the Hobbs Act included such a category in the Seventh Circuit.          So, the difficulty, the impediment to addressing your position is that however strong it may be, it wasn't resolved below, so why shouldn't we follow the natural order that first the District Court speaks, and then the Court of Appeals, and then it comes here?         Why?         Were you --            I'm concerned about your characterization, not only of suggesting that there was some attempt to force a particular decision, but I'm reading the Seventh Circuit's remand to the District Court.        It went through your argument, which it said was a substantial one, that no change was intended in the codification.             And it said, "While these revisions were intended to be formal stylistic changes, it is not beyond the realm of the possible that the revisers may have made certain substantive changes."                 That doesn't sound like they were ruling on it definitively, but they were tipping their hand.           "Not beyond the realm of the possible."          That was --           They asked the District Court to resolve it.            They said the District Court should resolve it in the first instance, and then they would review it, presumably.        Even though two U.S. attorneys, years back, did predicate cases on there being a discrete crime of obstructing commerce through violent means.         Ms. Blatt, your time is almost over, so, on the injunction part, what remedies are available to the United States under your reading of the provision?          Injunctive relief, yes.             What about -- is there any monetary relief that the United States can seek under RICO?        Yes.
04-1264 +++$+++             Mr. Landau --               Mr. Landau, maybe this -- this is a point your -- the respondent makes.                   Prima Paint talks about section 4 and it says, with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.        So the answer to everything you said could be, fine, if this were proceeding in, say, the Southern District of Florida, but it s in a State court.           And Prima Paint just spoke about procedure in Federal court.          You also run into a problem with the -- some States classify a contract as voidable and other States for that same ground make it void.       So at least you would have -- you would lose the uniformity if you ve made the distinction between those two.           What would be the issues for the arbitrator in this case?                 Is there anything other than was it -- was this interest usurious?                 The dispute between the parties -- we re not told what the issues are that would be subject to arbitration.
04-1324 +++$+++          It was a computation error.       This is not a -- this is not a case where the State chose to waive the statute of limitations.                 It miscalculated.         Isn't that the case?         But we're not -- and we didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely. We are on the assumption that it was untimely.                But -- and what are the consequences of the State's failing to raise that?         But the --         -- the whole basis was the number of days that they calculated, and the magistrate said, "Oh, they miscalculated.                 There were more days involved."         Yes.         Suppose --         Suppose the magistrate judge had said, "I notice this error in accordance with Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to the State that they amend their answer."                  The State certainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules apply, the State could have amended its answer and done just what the magistrate judge did.             I --             Did it say "an obligation," or that the court "could"?                   It didn't -- I didn't think it said the court "must."           Where is -- I see -- you're referring to page 4(a) and --           Yes.    Which -- where is the sentence that says it -- that --           I thought that that duty is in connection with Rule 4.         Well, we could --         -- we could -- we could agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is, you know, the -- it could be a "must," it can be "may not," or it could be "may."          And why shouldn't we treat this as a "may"?           The judge noticed the clerical error and called it to the party's attention by an order to show cause.          We're past Rule 4, because an answer has been ordered.          So -- and it's only when the answer comes in that this issue is spotted.          There are very what standards?         Yes, "leave shall be freely given."         Well, what would be the prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas petitioner?          But you couldn't do this under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized, that, just from the petition, from the habeas petition, you couldn't tell.         There wasn't --         Yes, but the civil rules allow for amendment.         There's 8(c), and there's 12(b), but there's also 15.         It seems the height of technicality to say that the judge could suggest, "Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the answer, under Rule 15," instead of saying, "I'm issuing an order to show cause why this action is not out of time."            Were those --            -- cases -- were those cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State? The judge's view was that the State had miscalculated under eleventh-amendment -- under Eleventh Circuit precedent.           But here, nothing --           -- happened.   Nothing happened.         There was --           The answer was put in, and then there were no further proceedings.                Nothing else went on in the court.           It's quite different -- I don't know any judge that would allow a defendant, after the trial is over, to raise the statute of limitations. But, up front, it's a different situation.
04-1327 +++$+++          What about -- what about the DNA -- the exclusion of the alleged perpetrator, of White?       There -- there was no trace of White's DNA. And that was a FBI officer who testified to that.         That's a question on which we didn't grant cert.
04-1329 +++$+++             It's not a --           As I understand the respondent's position, it's not the component.                   They're not arguing that.        So you're answering a hypothetical case that isn't presented here. And also, respondent says that we are talking only about patents where there is a successful tie.                   So leave out all those cases where I have a patent and it's never produced a penny, and somehow I can make mileage out of that.          There was a -- a point that you were in the process of answering.                    The -- the argument is made that this tying product had such clout that you were able to extract not twice but three times the price for the tied product.                    And you were saying no to even double the price.
04-1332 +++$+++           And there is -- in fact, there's no immunity.         That's what makes this different. Suppose the Bivens action had been brought first.        The officers would not have been immune from suit.       It's not like an officer who has qualified immunity and doesn't depend upon the suit order.                    Here, there would have been no immunity at all if you'd sued the officers directly and not brought that Federal Tort Claims Act suit first.          It's hard to accept that argument given that if the lawyer had sued in the reverse order, there would be the same morale.                All the rest would follow. So here it's -- it's a question of the lawyer brought the wrong lawsuit first, and the attack on the morale -- there's no difference if a Bivens action had been brought and no other action.                Is there any -- why is this morale changed by the Government having gotten the first case dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction with no consideration of the merits at all?          What was the harassment that this employee experienced in the -- in the FTCA claim that was dismissed?          Did that -- did that involve the employee or it was just legal argument involving lawyers representing the United States?              Could the two claims have been brought together?               This is -- if an employee is in an uncertain situation, doesn't know if the FTCA act applies, it certainly doesn't want to be without any defendant for conduct of the kind that -- that this complaint charges.            Could such an employee say I want to bring my Tort Claims Act against the United States, but I'd like to have in that same lawsuit, in case the court says it comes under an exception, my Bivens claim?        Would it be possible to bring those suits together?              I'm -- I'm asking --              -- does the Government have a position on that, whether you can combine a suit against the United States under the Tort Claims Act with a suit against the individual officers under Bivens.          But I want you to go back before we get to a judgment.              Can such a suit be brought?          Could this lawyer have brought the FTCA act complaint and pled in the alternative the Bivens claim?            Your theory would cover the case where the FTCA claim drops out because the employee didn't file the administrative claim within the -- what is it?          6 months?            But don't they have a short span where they have to bring that administrative claim?           And the suit is tossed out because one of those deadlines was met.                    It would follow, I think, under your reasoning that there could be no subsequent Bivens claim.              What about 2679(b)(2) of the Westfall Act which says the Government doesn't get substituted for the employee in a Bivens claim? Westfall -- the Congress was -- was quite concerned, it seems, with preserving an action brought for violation of the Constitution of the United States.
04-1350 +++$+++                  May I ask, if that's the position of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to cancel the patent?                But the question is, you say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent, that it's an invalid issuance.              So why aren't they curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is going to do?                You're talking about in this case.                We're talking about what the law should be.      Would you make, be making the same argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions of the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within the year, and each as I remember they held that the patent was obvious and therefore invalid?                Suppose we were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were they, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar?                  You disagree with the motivation test.               So perhaps you're not the --                 Mr. Hungar, this is the problem that I have with your test.                       I think I understand you right, now, just to say teaching suggestion motivation has its place; it's okay; but it shouldn't be the exclusive test.                And what I understand your brief to say is that it has to be supplemented with what you have called, you've labelled "sufficiently innovative."   And then I begin to think well, what's "sufficiently innovative?"          How is a trier supposed to know if something -- in other words I think what you're suggesting as a supplement is rather vague.               What about the experts? You said this was obvious and this should have, not have gotten very far.     But there were two experts, were there not, who made declarations, that had all kinds of credentials, and they called it elegant, novel and nonobvious.               Well these, these were declarants who gave a whole declaration.                   They didn't just say that bottom line.
04-1360 +++$+++          Is that because the damages are slight or because there's a defense that is successful?         What has been the defense in these tort cases?          Mr. Moran, would you clarify an answer you gave to Justice O'Connor at the outset of the argument?            You said there is no statutory right to get a no-knock warrant.               But did you say, as a matter of case law and practice, that can be done in Michigan?          In --              In the courts that have allowed this action to go forward, has the rationale been that there is no other effective deterrent to ignoring or violating the knock-and-announce rule?
04-1371 +++$+++          Mr. Kasner, may I just interrupt those references to ask you -- one could agree that, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial purposes, the "in connection with" is as broad as you suggest.        But for purposes of private actions, it isn't that broad; it is limited, as this Court said in Blue Chip Stamps.        It is possible for the same words, even in the same statute, in difference contexts, to mean different things.              Would you explain the rule of lenity?             Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can be.     I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that applied strictly to civil liability.         What about the --         -- the claim that's made here, the second claim, where the broker said, "We lost clients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and we want to be compensated for that," nothing about the inflated price of the security --         -- just that "our clients don't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad advice."             I know, but I --             -- wanted to know what the Government's position was on that claim.                 Could that be brought in a State court --             -- even as a class action?             How do you deal with the Court's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- that the court says -- in the Federal court -- "these 10(b) actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and sellers," but that limitation is attenuated, because deserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law, including the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip Stamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way for Blue Chip?
04-1376 +++$+++            Has any -- a number of courts have considered this question -- have any of them accepted your first -- your argument that the statute is clear that it is nonretroactive?           I'd -- I'll have to look at those decisions.         It was my impression that they did, indeed, hold that it was retroactive, but not on the ground that Congress had clearly spoken to the point, so that you didn't need any further inquiry.        Am I wrong in thinking that readjustment based on his marriage was not one of the modes of relief that he could have had in '82 or -- that that didn't come in until much later, is that so?        So, any -- so, that was a consequence that certainly wasn't taken away from him, because it wasn't there in '82.          Even though what --          Well, in St. Cyr --          -- was -- in St. Cyr, I think it was he pled guilty under one set of expectations, and that's what the Court fastened on. Isn't that so?          Well, he --        -- might not have pled guilty if there was a different set of rules.              I thought that was what drove the Court's opinion.
04-1414 +++$+++           The affidavit -- wasn't the affidavit available to the executing officer?           Well, what -- what -- take this variable.           The -- the warrant can be executed when the item is taken into the house, if I remember what it said.       Suppose the defendant is sitting on a porch, sees the postal carrier, gets up, takes the package, and proceeds to walk down the street, and never enters the house.          Could the warrant be executed?
04-1477 +++$+++           Why?          In Mullane, it was regular mail.       It wasn't certified mail.            Right?          And isn't it 100 percent clear that there were a number of those addressees who didn't get the letter?         And yet, their interests were cut out by the decision, and the Court said that was okay.         But you have another factor here that wasn't present in Mullane; that is, the person who received notice has a statutory obligation to advise government of the current address. The people involved in Mullane had no such obligation to notify anybody of their current address.          It wasn't the government in -- in Mullane it wasn't the government.          And he also had a continuing obligation to inform the government of his address. One fact about this case that -- perhaps it was in the record and I missed it.                    At the time the property was sold, how much did Mr. Jones owe, taking account of the back taxes, the interest, the penalties, all that?            How many people --           Mr. Kirkpatrick, you distinguish Mullane.            You recognize that a lot of the people never got that notice, and you said there were many people involved there, that you could rely on others.        It's also how much of a burden are you going to put on the notice-giver when you have a large class involved. There was a figure -- and I forgot what the number it was -- of how many notices are -- don't succeed in delivery.
04-1495 +++$+++              Mr. --          Mr. Kneedler, may -- would you clarify just one point about this probable cause? There was a grand jury that indicted this man, and then there was a trial judge who said, I'm throwing this out at the close of the Government's case.                  There is not enough evidence here to convict this man. Are you saying that as long as the grand jury indicts, there can be no Bivens claim because in order to indict, the grand jury would have had to find probable cause?         Well, tell me about now, not at the common law.         But the grand jury did find probable cause.          So what would the plaintiff have to show to overcome -- to -- to negate that finding of probable cause?         Mr. Kneedler, the D.C. Circuit, looking at this case, looking at the record closely, typed it one in which the evidence of retaliation was strong and probable cause weak.                  This is on 28a of the appendix to the petition for cert. That was the appraisal of the D.C. Circuit panel.                   And I think you've been arguing that that is not the case, but at least for our purposes at this posture, don't we -- shouldn't we accept that that is the picture here, weak evidence of probable cause, strong indications of retaliation?         But we're not talking about prosecutors there --         How about the judge granting a motion to quit at the close of the Government's evidence?           Why isn't that objective?          I wasn't --          Your opponent says -- says there is no probable cause requirement.                 You are now on there's no objective test.             It's all subjective.       I suggest that there could be an objective test.                 This is not going to the probable cause question.                Objective test?       Was this case thrown out at the close of the Government's evidence?
04-1506 +++$+++           You're -- you're talking without reference to the statute, and as I read the statute, the phrase that keeps reappearing is payments made by a third party for health care items or services.         So she has to turn over from her recovery what she got for health care, but we know that her tort claim consisted of a lot more.                    So if the Federal statute says she has to turn over what she received from the third party for health care services, well, she did that, and you agreed that that would be a fair allocation.              So I don't see how you get from her the -- a much larger share than what she got for health care.        But the State -- the State could sue in the first instance.                In fact, if you just read the text of the statute, it seems like the State is the one envisioned to be suing for reimbursement of the medical expenses.        But the State was in this case.       The State intervened.          So it was party to the case.        And when it -- it found out about the dismissal, why didn't it go right into the Arkansas court and say, you forgot about us?                   We were a party to this lawsuit.         Why would they be fighting the same anti-lien provision?               They would be -- wouldn't they be saying we have a claim for all of the medical expenses?         And no other party -- the injury victim didn't have authority from us to compromise our claim.       It's for us to compromise it.
04-1527 +++$+++               I don't --              I don't --            Miccosukee assumed that -- the soup ladle example from the Second Circuit; you took out the ladle, you held it up, and you put the same thing back.           But if I understand what happens as a result of the impoundment of the water and then its release, what comes out is quite different from what was put in.            It's kind of like you had a pot boiling with vegetables, and then you put it through a food processor, and then what you got out would be quite different from what went into the food processor.          I thought the descriptions that we had was, it is a result of the impoundment and the subsequent release that the water emerges in this unnatural state, in this striated state that Justice Kennedy was referring to.
04-1528 +++$+++          Mr. Bopp, would you clarify a procedural point?              As I understand it, on the expenditure issue, there is no final decision that has gone back to the district court for further proceedings.         And it may -- the district court might -- may well find that nothing passes constitutional muster in the end.           Are you arguing now then that there may be no limits on expenditures?         But there were lower limits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice Souter was asking about.         There were the thousand dollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in --         There -- there was a court that subsequently considered the rest and upheld the contribution --         Mr. Bopp, may I ask you? You keep -- the way you're discussing this case, one would think that the trial court found there was an evidentiary insufficiency, but I thought, at least on the contributions part, the trial court found that the evidence sufficed to justify those limits.            Can you -- can you point to the place in the district court opinion that you're referring to?
04-1544 +++$+++           What if the rem --          -- what if the rem is in another court before the bankruptcy begins?               What if the res is within -- is in another court?          So even -- even if property is in the custody of another court in the probate proceeding and the bankruptcy proceeding comes later, the bankruptcy proceeding would sweep whatever assets are before the probate court into the bankruptcy.          Mr. Richland --          -- what seems to me to be involved here is what is not uncommon in our Federal system, that is, two proceedings, both dealing with the same or closely related subject matter.                  It is not infrequent that you have parallel proceedings in Federal court and State court, and then the one that gets finished first -- that judgment is binding on the other.       And as I understand it, the probate proceeding concluded first before the district judge reviewed the bankruptcy judge's opinion.         Well, I'm -- I'm assuming -- and correct me if I'm wrong about this -- that the bankruptcy court makes a proposed opinion.             It doesn't become a binding opinion until it's affirmed by the district court.         Yes.         Well, if it isn't a core matter.        I think you lost on that in the district court.              But that was not reviewed by the Ninth Circuit.              That would -- that would be the -- if you -- if you're correct about the limits of the probate exception, that issue would be open for review by the Ninth Circuit.            Ms. Maynard, you said at one point it's not necessary for you to decide this, but there is vast confusion in the lower courts about the extent of the probate exception.                    And so I take it that your -- what you began -- what you began with is -- I wrote them down.             That's it?         And in addition to Markham, what other case of this Court do you think spells out the proper bounds?
04-1581 +++$+++               Mr. Bopp, to what extent can we take into account the surrounding circumstances? One thing that you advocate is to look at this ad in isolation.          But if you add to it that your organization made it clear that it opposed the candidacy of Senator Feingold and that it supported his opponents, that your organization also connected, as Justice Breyer just brought out, Senator Feingold with this filibuster, and then if the filibuster was such an important thing for grassroots lobbying, why was it that when the election was over, this ad was not repeated?               Can we return to --               Mr. Bopp, then can we return to my question?                Do we view the ad in isolation, and do we discount the connection by your organization of this Senator with the filibuster that you said was a very bad thing?           But the electorate will know that this issue is presented to them in connection with this Senator and that your organization has linked the two very clearly.
04-1618 +++$+++            Can a county be an arm of the State for some things?
04-1704 +++$+++            Mr. Olson, who would have -- who would have standing?                I understand your argument that Ohio taxpayers don't, but are there people who would have standing?            Mr. Olson, I had asked you the question, because I wanted to know whether this case was distinguishable from Flast in that regard, although I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge. That -- Flast seemed to be a case that fit that description, that there was no one who would have a better claim for injury, in fact.          Mr. Olson, I don't mean to deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there was one point in your brief that was of concern to me. That is, you said that you questioned whether, assuming we accept your argument on standing, it would be appropriate to return this case to the court of appeals with instructions that it be remanded to the State court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle one to.        And you said that would not be right.           And that's because it's a local -- it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the distinction you're making?           So, that's --           You would be challenging the local action --           -- rather than the State --           -- action, and that's how you distinguish the municipal taxpayer.           There are some -- at least it's arguable that there's Federal municipal taxpayer standing.         And certainly some States have said that there is.         And that -- and whatever Ohio might or might not do is not relevant to this proceeding.                     We don't know that.      I'm     -- you've given your opinion on what it would be.           Well, that's a --           -- that's the piggybacking question.         That's quite different.           And --           There isn't -- the tax credit doesn't give them -- require them to buy, in State.       I mean, the purchase -- whatever they equip the plant with can come from vendors and manufacturers, out of State?
04-1739 +++$+++           What is the reason that -- that the State or the regulations allow paperbacks from the library and not current events?                    I'm just -- that -- the rationality of -- of that line escapes me.                But you --                But if the concern is the safety concern, then you would have an equal concern with the Jewish Daily Forward, which is a newspaper format, or -- and I don't know what the Watchtower comes out in these days.        What does the -- what does the inmate have to show in order to go to the law library?         That is, suppose the inmate's position is I want to go there and I want to read Law Week and Legal Times and other -- I want to see what's new, what's breaking in the law so that maybe I'll have something I can put in a petition, and that's why I want to go every -- every chance I get to the law library.                    Could such an inmate go to the library?        Well, that would mean that the inmate could go and look at the legal newspapers, but not -- not the Christian Science Monitor.        So he could get Law Week, Legal Times, and --        -- the National Law Journal.         All of those he could get.        But I thought there, there was a genuine security concern, which I think you pretty much said doesn't exist here when you consider what they can have in -- in the cell.            Apart from those two, access to the courts and cruel and unusual punishment, then anything goes for this set of incorrigible prisoners?          They can take away -- the First Amendment, in other words, is out the window.                     They have no First Amendment rights that the State needs to respect.                     Is that --            But -- but for this -- for this group, while they're in that situation, essentially there's no First Amendment rights.                     I think that's what your -- your argument.                     They can regain them, but that's the purpose of the behavioral modification program.              But the -- the only thing that these prisoners get is the Eighth Amendment.
04-373 +++$+++           But the --          -- but the trial judge made certain findings.          He heard these witnesses.         He heard the police officers.          And he suggested that the -- Police Officer Reese was playing a good-cop/bad-cop game with Detective Johns. And so, that this -- the statement made by Reese, "You'll want to talk to us now, huh?" was designed to elicit an answer.                   And the trial court also said there is an additional factor, and that is this charge, that was intimidating even if it didn't have death on it, wasn't presented to Blake immediately.                   It could have been presented when he was put in the cell, initially.        So, there were those factors.           Those are relevant, are they not, to the character of what Blake said?          What about the factors that I mentioned?        Would they be relevant to a factfinder's determining what a reasonable person in that situation -- with the two police officers appearing, with the charges not being presented immediately, not being presented at the time the Miranda warnings were given, but only after                 -- would those be -- would those be relevant factors to decide if this was a voluntary initiated request to talk to the police?         May I --         May I -- before we get to that, I read the trial court's opinion, and it didn't seem to me that it was playing, as Justice Breyer said, this game of legal words and labels.            It was saying, "There are things to suspect here.      Yes, I credited Detective Johns.              But he was asked, 'Why did you bring along Reese?             You didn't need him?'"       And there was no answer to that. And there was also no explanation, after they left Blake in his cell, Reese just having said, "I bet you want to talk to us now, huh?" -- there was nothing said to assure Blake that that was not a "You'd better talk to us, or you're going to be in trouble" kind of thing.                There was just the statement by Blake and another Miranda warning.                 All of those things, the judge said, weighed on his mind, and he reached the conclusion that the Government hadn't sustained its burden on the basis of those factors. So, is that clearly erroneous?           I mean, don't we defer to the judge's findings?            But it doesn't count --            Mr. Feldman, it doesn't count as badgering, or the equivalent, that the police -- the -- walk in, and they present not only the charges, but they present the application for the charges, which shows that the co- perpetrator had talked to the police, talked his head off, and put all the blame, at every step on the way, on this defendant? That did weigh heavily in the trial judge's mind.           And is -- was that improper to take into account?          How would a reasonable person in this situation feel?"           Would he feel that he was impelled to speak, because the co-perpetrator had --            How about the trial judge's determination?            There was a question.        Everybody agrees Reese - - what Reese did was interrogate.            And the trial judge then finds there was an answer to that question.                  Is that a matter of fact?     It didn't seem that the trial judge was treating that as a matter of law.       But --       -- the prosecutors were well aware of that when they determined to appeal.       But perhaps they were worried that they didn't have a case without the defendant's statements.
04-433 +++$+++            Mr. Frederick, you -- you started by saying how difficult this would be to prove, but could the plaintiff piggyback on New York?                If New York was the defrauded party and taxes are owed to the State, has the State had no proceeding in this?           Do I understand correctly that the complaint has since been amended to assert a Federal income tax shortfalls?        Is there any impediment to New York suing him?        This would be -- it's kind of strange. New York has its tax scheme.              It has penalties for failure to pay tax.        And then it could go into the Federal court and say RICO is better than our penalties. RICO has treble damages.        The -- the Second Circuit seemed to rely on an earlier case that is much featured in Respondent's brief, but I don't recall your dealing with it.        Is that Commercial Cleaning case of the knowingly hiring undocumented aliens and paying them less than the minimum wage, which gave that person a competitive edge over rivals who -- who paid what the law required?
04-473 +++$+++             But in Rust v. Sullivan, the Government was buying a commodity.                    It was the Government's program, and it was employing people, funding people to implement that program.                   Here is a person whose job includes being candid, serving justice, serving truth. If that's part of his job responsibilities, that's quite different from speaking the speech that the Government wants spoken.            But what is your position?            Ms. Lee, is your position that job-required speech -- an assistant district attorney's obligation is to give his best opinion -- that job-required speech is outside the first-amendment protection?          You say the Ninth Circuit went too far, in one way.        But are you saying that as long as it's related to his job, it's simply not protected by the first amendment?          Is that your position?            Yes, I understand --            -- I understand that, but I was confused by your answer to Justice O'Connor, because the question was, Would this come out a different way under Pickering?          And I take it your answer is, this doesn't come in the door, because he's not speaking as a citizen.            I'm confused.   You think that this -- there was an aspect of it that was citizen speech? Why --            I --            Well, what do you mean --            -- by "the balance, weigh in favor"?        Because, a moment ago, I thought you answered me, "This kind of speech simply is not shielded by the" --            -- "first amendment."         What about the hearing at which this office had testified?                I thought that part of the complaint was, "When I spoke at the hearing, I was speaking in a public forum, and they fired me for it."
04-52 +++$+++              But there is no such -- that -- that s very far from this case, General Lockyer.             I did -- I did have one --          Can we -- can we go back --          She was certainly -- she was certainly wrong on the law.               When she -- when the gender question came up, she said, well, that's not a suspect category, and she seemed to be -- her notion was that it was okay to aim for a jury that had an equal number of men and women.               And it was -- she seemed to be thinking the same thing with regard to age too.      I agree with you she didn t withdraw it, but was -- the reasonable explanation was we don t want too many young people here.           So I m going to allow some, but I want older people to dominate.                   But the gender -- she had to be told by the judge Batson applies to gender.        That -- that seemed -- that seemed strange to me that -- that 2 years after, she would not know.
04-593 +++$+++            What -- what he's saying is treat me as a sole proprietor.                Yes, I created this corporation so I can be insulated from liability, but this is a one-person show and so I am bringing a 1981 claim and say forget the corporation.                  I'm the only human that's involved in this activity.        Did you say there is or --          Do corporations have a color?             Are you saying this is a matter of Federal contract law, common law, Federal common law, are -- or are you saying you go State by State, in which case 1981 is some places it will be third party beneficiary, some it won't?
04-597 +++$+++           On the issue that's before us now, I can understand why, if the, what we used to call, JNOV is not requested after the jury verdict, the appellate court could not then enter judgment -- direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.                But I don't see why it couldn't say, just as we would be reluctant to affirm a decision when there was no claim for relief, so, if there's insufficient evidence, we can remand for a new trial.       But you would say that that is not possible either.            But --            -- you haven't asked for it, but the appellate court said, "We don't want to affirm a judgment when there was insufficient evidence, so we are going to" -- there was -- the judge was tipped off by the -- by the directed-verdict motion, that the -- who turned out to be -- the one who turned out to be the verdict loser thinks the evidence is insufficient.                      That's enough at least to say that the Court of Appeals could grant a new trial.            No, I'm not --            -- talking about "against the weight," because a trial judge would rarely be -- if it -- if a trial judge said, "It's against the weight of the evidence," it would go back for a new trial, and you couldn't raise that issue, at least not til you go through the whole second trial.            But why isn't it like -- I think there are decisions that say there was a judgment, but the Court of Appeals determines there was never a claim for relief to begin with, even though a motion wasn't made to that effect.           The idea of a court affirming a judgment that is without sufficient legal basis is troubling.         But, it -- but it was asked by the -- by the pre-verdict motion.                     What -- the only thing that wasn't done is, it -- the request wasn't repeated after the verdict.              I can see your point if there had never been a motion for directed verdict at the close of all of the evidence.            But there was that.           And so, all that we're missing is a repetition of the same words after the jury comes in.            Well, that's -- the new trial comes in, by the courts that have said this, only -- they'd say, "We would direct the entry of judgment for the verdict loser, but we're powerless to do that."                  And that is all wrapped up in the Seventh Amendment.                  So, the next best thing is, we grant a new trial.            Yes.            Well, couldn't one regard a new trial as, sort of, subsumed under the request for judgment as a matter of law?                 That is, that's the larger thing, but at least a new trial.                   Don't let -- the judgment as a matter of law says, "Don't let this verdict stand."        So, one could say, "We won't give you a judgment, but we will order a new trial."          I don't understand your response to me about vastly different standards of review. I would think it would be harder for a verdict loser to get judgment as a matter of law than to get a new trial.          Yes.          That's why --          -- I'm suggesting --          -- that one is kind of a lesser included.         That's --         I don't think any appellate court has claimed that authority.                We're talking about a new trial in lieu of J- -- a judgment as a matter of law. And the -- one of the whole rationales in Cone and Globe and all of the others were saying you should make the post-verdict motion -- is that then the trial judge would have the option.          The trial judge might think, "Well, technically, you deserve JMOL, but maybe there was a witness who was out to sea, so I want to exercise my discretion to grant a new trial."                 Those two are closely linked.        I mean, lawyers usually, as a -- just a matter of -- just automatically ask for JNOV or, in the alternative, a new trial.            But --            -- in fact, that's not what the Courts of Appeals have said.                   They have all said, "We would grant judgment as a matter of law, but we're powerless to do that under this case -- Court's case law. We think the evidence is insufficient, not that it's against the weight of the evidence.                     We think it's insufficient.             If we had the power to do it, we would direct the entry of judgment.                  We can't do that, so we do the next best thing." But in all of the -- including the Tenth Circuit, whose law is relevant here -- the Court of Appeals is saying, "We think the judgment -- there was insufficient evidence to support that judgment.                    And if we had the power, we would instruct the entry of judgment. We don't have that power."          It's a -- it's a conditional ruling on the new-trial motion.          Because if it were a ruling on the new-trial motion, you would never get up to the Court of Appeals.
04-607 +++$+++          But wasn't the issue there what is patentable?          I mean this case in the district court was under this definiteness idea, 112.                   101 deals with what's patentable.         And it seems to me that you -- this case was presented as a definiteness case.         Is the Abbott test -- that's patented and you're paying royalties for that?            You set off the district court and the court of appeals but you don't think the district court got it right, either.                        You said the district court required something more.            What was the something more and why wasn't that adequate?           What the district court did is it got, it tried this case and it got a rather large jury verdict.           And I don't understand how you're setting off the district court from the court of appeals when the court of appeals, whatever it said, it affirmed the judgment of the district court.
04-623 +++$+++            May I comment --           May I --           -- may I ask you about the position this Court took in Glucksberg?                 That is, everyone on the Court in that case seemed to assume that physician- assisted suicide was a matter for the State, and the Government, at that time, said, "State legislatures undoubtedly have the authority to create the kind of exception to assisted suicide fashioned by the court of appeals.         There is every reason to believe that State legislatures will address the urgent issues involved in this case in a fair and impartial way."                 And then the Government added that, "There is no indication that the political processes are malfunctioning in this area." That was a position presented to this Court in the Glucksberg case by the Government. Now, you are rejecting that position.         But we're told that the -- those methods are less gentle to the patient, the methods that the State of Oregon has authorized its physicians to prescribe.          We are told, at least in some of the briefs, that, from the patient's point of view, it's much less upsetting.          But Congress --          -- Congress spoke --          -- Congress spoke about section -- schedule 1 drugs, and that's what's lacking here.       Congress says schedule 1 drugs, those are: no, never; schedule 2: okay on a doctor's prescription.
04-631 +++$+++           But doesn't incur it, or gets a credit or get it back, if it sells to the United States or if it sells out-of-State.               In other words, it's not just the receipt.          And out-of-State or abroad --              Well, that -- that has been what's discussed in the brief, and I think that the court, in Chickasaw, was saying, If the State puts the incidence on the tribe itself, we don't have to look any further. That's what it said.               When the State levies a tax directly on the tribe or members inside the reservation, no balancing.          But then it also said that if the incidence rests on non-Indians, as here, with the distributor here, then there is no categorical bar, than balancing kicks in. So, all Chickasaw dealt with, with the categorical rule, is when the State says the incidence of the tax is on the tribe.        Mr. Olson, in terms of the text of the statute that is -- the incidence is on the distributor of the first receipt, but then there's this language -- and it appears in a few places -- "the tax is hereby imposed on the use, sale, or delivery."               What does -- what does that mean, that the tax is imposed on the use, sale, or delivery?"            Mr. Olson --            -- could we go back --            -- to the question that Justice Souter raised at the outset?                       Because I'm really puzzled.         This is the picture I have of the case.                 And please tell me where it's wrong. Two jurisdictions, both with authority to impose a tax, the State and the tribe.                   So, if the other weren't taxing, there wouldn't be any question, that the tribe can tax and the State can tax.                 But the two can't coexist, because the consumer's not going to pay the price.                        So, only one can.             And the issue is, which one dominates, and which is one is subordinate?                  But you have unquestionable authority to tax in both.                And I thought it was clear that the two taxes did -- this is not a case where the tribe can impose a tax, the State can im- -- oppose.                     I read the briefs to accept that the tribe tax -- couldn't put its tax on top of the State tax.          But not tax-free.        I mean, the -- a big thing that was made in this case was that, unlike the cigarette sales in the smoke shops, the tribe is not trying to market a tax exemption.                   It is putting on its own tax, which will cost the customer, in the end, the same as if there had been a State tax.
04-698 +++$+++           Mr. Hurd, do you recognize -- to narrow what's at issue -- that the parent objecting to the school's IEP would at least have a burden of coming forward?        In other words, I -- are you speaking just of the ultimate persuasion burden?                Wouldn't the parents at least be required to come forward with some reason to believe that the State -- the school district's plan is inadequate?            May I ask you, before you get to your three reasons, to go back to your -- something that you said?            I asked you, Are you dividing the burden of production and persuasion?                  And you said no, it's all on one side or the other.                But it seems to me your description of this proceeding, you said the school district goes first.             So --            -- the school district did come forward.             And is that the usual practice in these administrative hearings -- that the first one to go to defend the plan is the school district, not the parents who are attacking it?          But you said, in this case --          -- the school district went first.          So, now, as a result of the Fourth Circuit's decision, do the parents always go first --          -- and not the school district?         The school district has a plan that it has put forward.        And it seemed to me logical, well, it has a plan, so it should defend it.          So, you think the ALJ -- or the administrative hearing officer in this case told the State to go first -- the school district to go first because he thought that maybe they had burden of proof, and would not have asked them to go first if he didn't?            So, but you're saying this -- this is an ad hoc thing.               There is no general practice about which one goes first.
04-712 +++$+++           Mr. Frederick, what about cases where a plaintiff sues two defendants -- one is diverse, and the other is not diverse -- and there is a motion by the defendants to dismiss for want of diversity?        The plaintiff then says, "Oh, but only one of those defendants is the 'real-party whatever,' and I can drop the other one, because the other one is not the 'real party in interest'"? Now, that's a situation where courts, even if this court has never had that problem, have said, "If the second defendant, the non-diverse defendant, is a 'real party,' you can't get rid of the case that way, but if it's not -- if it's not, you can keep the -- just drop it and keep the case going against the 'real party in interest.'"                There are such cases.           Ah, but the plaintiff said, "This is a complicated real estate business, and I want to discover whether there is -- whether the 'true defendant' is a Virginia citizen, as I am."      So, on the face of it, it looks like there's complete diversity, but, in fact, the diverse defendant is hiding the "real party."                       I think that's the position that the plaintiff was taking.               The plaintiff --               -- the plaintiff points to two offices of the defendant, who's -- the defendant is described by defendant as a Texas corporation -- but there was one witness -- Chaney, was it? -- who said that Lincoln is not a corporation.              It is a partnership.          No corporate board.           Well, they thought they got closer with a witness named Franzen, who was a Virginia resident, and who also described Lincoln as a partnership, and himself as a partner.           Well, plaintiff certainly wouldn't want to say there's an indispensable party missing, I take it, because then that would put the plaintiff out of court.                    The plaintiff is arguing that there's another defendant who should be in here.          And because you represent the removing defendant, it is true, is it not, that the removing defendant has the burden of showing that proper diversity exists?             Mr. Frederick, would you clarify one thing for me?                 I don't know how we even get to the second question, about partnership. If you're right that Lincoln is a corporation -- it's a Texas corporation, with its principal place of business in Texas, end of case; it's the only named defendant -- so, how do we get to something about a partnership?             Well, I don't understand it.            We wouldn't vacate the judgment in part.       If we reversed, --             -- that's the end of it.             Yes, but, Mr. Frederick, before that -- you know, read back -- the court -- the Fourth Circuit has said, "It appears that the real and substantial party in interest is this Virginia subsidiary, be it a partnership, be it a corporation." So, it's -- the thing about nexus is not self-standing.            The court is positing that there is a Virginia corporation or a Virginia partnership in the picture, and then says, "And given that, not only is it -- is it a Virginia entity, but it's got this close nexus because of -- it's operating substantially there, as well."
04-721 +++$+++           But that's something -- where would we -- we would just pick that number, that --          Yes.   Because that's a normal appeal period?          In -- even if, as he alleged, he was unable to do anything in --          This is a layperson.    He said, "I tripped in the intermediate appellate court, because I didn't do any research.                And so, I wanted to do better, but they gave me a job where, during the hours that the library was open" --          -- "I had to be at work. And that's why it took me all this time."          Now, is that -- suppose the prison locks down someone and says, "You can't go to the library."
04-759 +++$+++          Can you back --         -- up in Muniz a little bit? Because that was a prison administration.                   And so, what is the private-party analog to that?         I don't recall --         -- that in the decision.          The phrase from the Tort Claims Act about "as a private party" was repeated, but I don't remember any discussion of what that private party would be, in Muniz.         Because in those days the Government was arguing it should be like State officials.            There was an argument that was made in your brief, and I didn't fully grasp the thrust of it, in the -- that is, you said that the Mine Safety and Health Administration has a duty to the Secretary of Labor, but not to the mine operator and not to the miner.             If that were true, then would there be -- you wouldn't even get to the Good Samaritan doctrine, would you, if the only duty is to the Secretary of Labor?         You're not sure that the Good Samaritan doctrine is the -- is necessarily what the Arizona law would be -- what the analog would be.
04-805 +++$+++             Then what did it mean -- I think you said it in your brief -- that there -- both brands were sold exclusively by Equilon after the joint venture created -- was created.                  Each venturer maintains its own marketing strategy.                 What was the marketing strategy that each venturer, Shell and Texaco, separately maintained?
04-848 +++$+++             Negligent --            -- transmission.            But an automobile accident is something, as the Government points out, that any agency of Government can be involved in, not peculiar to the Postal Service.           But the transmission of the letter is -- the words are "negligent transmission."                    Many people think of the Postal Service, the letter carrier, delivering the mail to one's home.           That act surely fits the word "negligent transmission."        As is a automobile accident, and it -- the Chief suggested to you that there are other kinds of people who deliver items.                And that kind of negligence, you say, is within the exception.        That --        That you say --        I'm sorry.     Outside the exception.        So, there, you're saying that the Post Office is just -- it's just like everyone else with respect to automobile accidents, right?        But -- and -- you -- therefore, it should be just like everyone else with respect to this negligent delivery in --          What about the practical problem that was raised that, in the automobile accident, there's witnesses, there's a police report, usually; but a slip-and-fall over mail, nobody's around, these are easily made up, and the Post Office has no opportunity to check?             But the point that -- I think that they were making is that there will be an investigation, on the spot, ordinarily, in the case of a vehicle collision.             Post Office won't even know about the slip-and-fall until a claim is filed, which could be weeks and weeks later.
04-881 +++$+++ 
04-885 +++$+++        So was -- there's a section of the Bankruptcy Act -- I think it's 160(c) [sic] -- that says if it's an unrelated transaction, then -- so, it would be a permissive counterclaim if we had ordinary civil proceedings.            Then there can be a setoff to the extent of the claim that's being made against the bankrupt estate.         There can't be any affirmative recovery, as there could be with a permissive -- with a compulsory counterclaim.       But you're saying that that section is unconstitutional -- 160(c) [sic]?          But if we're talking just about VMI, not about the other schools, then you -- if this claim is unrelated, so that it would be a permissive counterclaim, then you would say not even against VMI could you have the setoff.          But why shouldn't a setoff be a defense, even if it's unrelated?               I mean, there were such things in -- at common law, were there not, that you could set off an unrelated debt?          No, I mean a setoff --          -- only --            So, you're not -- I thought your position was:             VMI, okay.   If they filed a claim, then they're open to affirmative recovery if it's a compulsory counterclaim; offset, if it's a permissive counterclaim.                   But I thought you said, as to the three other schools, no waiver.                   There's not -- no way you can lump them in.               I thought that was --            -- your position.          That's the question you've presented, Mr. Thro, but it was the same question that was presented to us in Hood.            And in Hood, we decided that we were not going to answer the question presented, we were going to decide the case on a lesser ground.                So, the Court, certainly if our venture in Hood was proper, here, too, we could decide the case on some other ground than the one you presented in your question.          Well, then that would be a ground to allow them to present it below.                They had a total winner --          -- on that hands below.
04-8990 +++$+++             At one point--            Justice Scalia said blood of the victim.            You don't contest that this was the blood of the victim.             The question is at what point did it get transferred to the jeans.            There's no question about it being someone else's blood.          Will you also cover, because your time is short, if you get through the gateway on your actual innocence contention, what are your constitutional claims that lie behind it?                 Because I don't think much was said about that in the briefing. What is it that you would -- you would say if you got through the gate?
04-905 +++$+++        Mr. Englert --              -- suppose you had a case of two Volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially ordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial period of time, one dealer -- we'll call that dealer the "favored dealer" -- consistently gets higher concessions, and the other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case, consistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions.                So, we don't have a picture of what you call "mix and match," but two dealers, one consistently getting higher concessions, and one consistently getting lower, and, therefore, missing out on sales or making sales at a very low profit.              That, too, would be out of Robinson-Patman, if I understand your view of the statute.       Mr. --       -- Mr. Hungar, do you agree with Mr. Englert that even if you had -- you could -- you had a case based on two dealers, one consistently gets higher concessions, one consistently gets lower concessions, and they're in roughly the same market -- that even that would not be covered by Robinson-Patman?         But I --         -- I'm not putting the head-to-head in.          Just, one of his sales gets lower concessions; one, higher.         That's --
04-928 +++$+++           Without any clue --          -- without any clue whether there's a relevance test?                I mean, here we're talking about alibi evidence.               If the determination of guilt is final, then alibi is irrelevant at the penalty stage.       That's why I found that statute so puzzling, that the jury doesn't have a clue.                 They're told, "Everything from the guilt phase comes in, you can consider," but it doesn't sort out, doesn't even tell them, relevance.        No, I wasn't suggesting anything other than what Justice Scalia said, but I was just curious about this statute that tells the jury, "You can consider everything," and gives them no guidance, because some of it might be quite inappropriate for them to consider.          But there's -- used on the other side and as a policy model, the model penal code, I think, says it's okay.            It -- not really that it's okay.       It should be considered.        But there are a number of States that do --        Your --           -- position is --        -- that it's up to the States, I take it, but it's not compelled by the eighth amendment.
04-944 +++$+++           So you say -- so now it's essentially redundant.           Now that 1331 has no jurisdictional amount, no amount in controversy, the jurisdictional provision in title VII is just going over the same territory.            It doesn't add or detract. Is that so?             Which is not subject matter jurisdiction, which is what we're concerned with here.         What would you call this? Would you call 15 or more employees an element of your claim that you must prove?         Or there could be an affirmative defense and you're not claiming the latter.         But you're -- you're accepting that it is your burden rather than the employer's to show that the employer had fewer than 15 employees.          How does it -- you -- you told us of your extensive experience.                 How does the numerosity requirement usually come up?                 You've accepted that it's an element of your claim rather than an affirmative defense the defendant must plead and prove.       So how does it ordinarily come up?           Does it -- because defendant answers and asserts that it has fewer than 15 employees?             Mr. Joseffer, maybe you can raise the podium a bit so the microphone works better.        The other way.          What -- what about the EEOC having typed the question jurisdictional for administrative processing purposes?         The -- the question was whether the truck drivers counted as employees because if they did, they'd have enough?
04-9728 +++$+++           Mr. Long --          -- with respect to liberty, as it -- it's not disputed, is it, that your client could have had his parole revoked even though the search was suspicionless?                So, what we're talking about the difference between revocation of parole, on the one hand, and a separate criminal offense.                   Is that right?          But I thought that evidence seized could be introduced, could be a basis to revoke parole.          So, the -- what the -- the consequence here is whether --              -- he will have his parole revoked --              -- or he will have a separate criminal offense.           Are you relying --           -- on the difference between -- you said "officer in the field."                   Would this be okay if it had been his parole officer?           The parole officer was walking along the street, saw this guy, and said, "I'm going to search you."          Why?           Why?     If it -- if it -- if it -- it doesn't go to the suspicionless character of the search, but it does say it has to be reasonable in time, place, or manner.           And maybe the --           -- officers are reasonable in time, place --           -- or manner.           How many times has it been challenged --           -- on the --           What about drug offenders, given the high rate of recidivism?             Suppose you were in a halfway house, and the State says, "We're creating a status.        One is, you're a prisoner.                 Another is, you're a halfway house.         Another is, on your -- parole.                But we want to subject you to suspicionless searches at -- in all three stages -- prison, halfway house, parole." Could they do it for the halfway house?             This person goes --             -- out to work, comes back at the end of the day, and is checked in.             Yes, while the --           -- while the --           The person who is in this semi-custody state, he's going to work, and, while he's at his workplace, the police officer shows up and says, "I'm going to pat you down, and then I'm going to" --           -- "see if you have drugs."
04-980 +++$+++              So, you would say Clemons should come out the other way, given the current state of the Mississippi statute?        They're not totally different, because one of them is special circumstances.        And it distinguishes those from circumstances of the crime, and then it -- then it says, "and special circumstances."                So, it seems to me that "special circumstances" is a discrete factor, different from "circumstances of the crime."          In other words, you said that the error was harmless under Chapman, the higher standard --          -- and that the California court so ruled.           And if that ruling is correct, then you would never get to any Brecht standard; the Federal court would have to say California applied the proper harmless- error analysis, and that's the end of the case.          So the -- so the second question, once we get past weighing, is whether California, in fact, did do what Chapman said.                Is that right?        Well, the problem --        -- here is that the California Supreme Court decision is rather skimpy once you get to harmless error.          What was -- the argument was that, in California, the burden of proof is on --          -- the defendant, instead of on the prosecutor for the harmless-error inquiry?          Do you agree that such residual-doubt factors are appropriately considered if the defendant didn't raise them?                I mean, the question of -- that, yes, the jury found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but maybe there's something that makes that determination doubtful.
05-1056 +++$+++                That -- Mr. Olson, that is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what you call the object code appears in the -- in the computer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with the master disk, and the object code is the critical component, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the first question that you raised, whether digital software code, an intangible sequence of 1's and 0's may be considered a component of a patent, patented invention?               That depends on what you consider the component.       They define component as including the, what you've been calling the abstract.                 What did the Federal Circuit say?     And I read the opinion a couple of times and it was, it seemed to me ambiguous whether the Federal Circuit was identifying the component as the object code itself or the master disk.               Mr. Joseffer, to the, to the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign nations that would have an interest in this, usually when that is so, hear from them and in this case there is a strange silence in that regard.              Let me ask you about a domestic law question.       One side is telling us it's the component that's supplied, whether it's the master disk or the object code.     And the other side says this is just like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template. Can a blueprint be patented?            Can a mold be patented?              Yeah, but patent --               Windows wasn't around when this statute was passed.               I thought it was the position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be brought into an electronic era, and so the -- the Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that notion should apply to an electronic world.
05-1074 +++$+++                  Mr. Russell, I thought that your argument was that yes, you know that you haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an incremental thing.      You may think the first year you didn't get a raise, "well, so be it."                     But you have, you have no reason to think that there is going to be this inequality.     I mean she started out getting the same pay, right?             What happened to the Equal Pay Act claim?       You started out with a Title VII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along the way the equal pay claim dropped out.             Why didn't you ask for the equal pay claim?        As I understand the magistrate judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first hurdle, you had a prima facie case.                       You showed that you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the men are getting much higher.              But the employer has come forward with any other factor other than sex and the other factor is that, your inadequate performance.                Because in the Title VII case assuming you're right, that you get across the same threshold, you're faced with the same defense.   Right?               It didn't have the same defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under Title VII, right?                Where does it say --              I thought your answer before was that this is not -- if she's going to bring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this builds up year by year to the point where see is saying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a requirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get equal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I thought -- I mean, the chance that she could win when she gets a salary review and she gets a little less than the other person are nil.              The -- as I remember the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she got a substantial raise and the reason, according to her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was below the minimum of the appropriate range for her job?               I thought at least in this area, the defenses were the same as under the Equal Pay Act.             Not under the Equal Pay Act.   You can only equalize up, not down.
05-1120 +++$+++                But whatever position holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power plants, and has there been any application to EPA with respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?               Mr. Milkey, does it make a difference that you're not representing a group of law students, but a number of States who are claiming that they are disarmed from regulating and that the regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising it?   I thought you had a discrete claim based on the sovereignty of States and their inability to regulate dependent on the law Congress passed that gives that authority to the EPA.       I thought that was --                 But if you are right and then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources, we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress -- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though we have the authority to do this, we think that we should spend our resources on other things. Suppose they said that?                       You said they didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then EPA says our resources are constrained and we're not going to spend the money?
05-1126 +++$+++               Mr. Kellogg, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid using the word fact throughout.                And from 1938 on, it has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead facts.   The index of forms, the appendix of forms shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is, and you're not required to plead facts.                   And yet that's the central -- seems to be the central thrust of your argument.                 But negligently drove. It doesn't say whether it went through a stop light. Doesn't say whether it was speeding.                     It doesn't say any one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.             Wasn't that a summary judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before? The Matsushita decision?              I don't understand acting in self interest.           I mean, they might just decide apart from, you know, if they go into their territory they'll come into mine, that investing in this wired business isn't the best, the best bet for them.     Maybe they want to get into the wireless business and think that's a better way to spend their money.
05-11284 +++$+++                Why, when we are told that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting the Nelson case for this one?               How does that, if the evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.               So you -- if your case is less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other way.     But it doesn't mean that those factors are not mitigating factors.
05-11304 +++$+++                The judge, the judge, I thought, told the lawyers what the charge would be, and I think also said I can't give a separate charge on mitigation because that's a job that only the Texas legislature can do.            I am bound by the statute to give these two things. I think the judge said that, so it was the understanding of everyone.              Otherwise you have a Supreme Court decision that the State court can say, thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but we -- there was a procedural default here.                 Although we bypassed it the first time, we're not going to bypass it after the Supreme Court has told us what the Federal law is.
05-1157 +++$+++                 How about in this case Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case? And did it take any position?               How should we, we weigh -- Congress is asking with respect to securities, private securities litigation, Congress looked at that and thought some restraint had to be placed on private actions, but it didn't do anything with respect to antitrust private action.              Are there many situations in which a particular industry is subject to regulators and they sometimes conflict?            Like EPA and OSHA?              What happens on remand in this very case based on your theory?                    You are not adopting the district judge's position that this case should be dismissed outright.              What happens when it goes back?              But why, if this is a sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says too much or too vaguely?          A district court doesn't have to leave the pleader to its own devices.                 It can have a pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left alone to do what he or she will. But in complex cases like this, the district judge will often assert control from the beginning and not leave the parties to do what they want.                 What would, what would a satisfactory complaint for this party look like?
05-1240 +++$+++                  Mr. Flaxman, one starting point.   You say that this case should be just like Heck, but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983 and habeas, right?                 But at least this case involves no such concern about habeas.                I thought the Seventh Circuit said in -- quickly in passing that the damages would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful arrest until the time of arraignment.                    That would, that would be the -- be all of your damages.                    If there wasn't an arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to the seizure.                You asked us to take that case and we didn't.              But if that's the boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one happen later matter?
05-1256 +++$+++              Mr. Frey, are you talking about what is numbered, is it number 34?             That's the --             You don't think that would confuse the jury if they are first told that they may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and then the next instruction seems to say they can't?             Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties?     Your brief quotes something to that effect, but -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to the petition.    It says, what the Oregon court said is, Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties.            The Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly disease.             But Mr. Frey, we don't know what Oregon law is on that point.             They do have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they must adjust in the next case.             And how would you deal -- would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, but to some State fund?               But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?               We don't know what it is. We haven't had the second case.             But part of this award, at least according to the trial -- there's a footnote referring to an Oregon statute that provides for the distribution of punitive damages between prevailing parties and the State of Oregon.            Is -- was this award shared?             But would it be?             But if the State law provides that part of the recovery goes to the State, then at least as to the part that goes to the State you can say, well the State has recovered and you can't --             But then you can object in the next case if you're subjected to --             No, I mean when you lose the case on the merits and there's a determination of damages, Oregon says, we adjust for having a prior award.    We don't know what that adjustment will be.
05-1272 +++$+++               Otherwise, the Attorney General could just bring it all over again, a fresh complaint, and that would be wasted motion?                But the theory is not necessarily bad.   The, the relator has to cooperate with the Government, ideally he should.                 And if the Government said we prefer a variance of your theory, and the relator said fine, "I don't want to put competing theories before the jury, so I'll surrender my first theory and go with the Government's," why should the relator be penalized for that good litigation practice? It doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint is no good or even that it might not have been proved, if the Government had preferred another route.                There were other documents.     He said there were other documents and the district court said sorry, you came up with that too late, I'm not going to look at the other documents.
05-128 +++$+++               Would it -- would it if the employer were self-insured?                   Can you be self- insured for workers' comp?           Would that be a plan then?           So it would be an employee benefit program, but not a plan.         And why did --         -- why did you answer Justice Scalia's question as you did?                   That is also an employee benefit, that is, vacation, sickness.               I thought there's also, isn't there, the Pension Benefit -- even if there's no money in the till for the plan, isn't there a Government fund so that the worker would receive the benefit in any event if -- I don't see the distinction that you're making based on whether the worker would get a benefit whether or not the employer made the contribution.               Mr. Strain --               -- in -- in your brief, you seem to put considerable stress on something that I haven't heard you say one word about so far, and that is that these -- workers' compensation is State- mandated.         They're not negotiated or even employer- determined benefits.              They are whatever the law prescribes.              And you haven't -- haven't mentioned that, so I'm wondering where that fits into your picture.
05-1284 +++$+++                That is -- this is certainly not your revenue officer needing help from a citizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still during Prohibition.     But what about the Government contractor cases that are cited, the Agent Orange was one example?              Well, the prison case, there's not any if about it.             A State, municipality, has a contract with a private entrepreneur to run a prison. One question that I think must have come up in that context comes under the 1983 action in -- against a, a prison guard, a privately hired prison guard.                  I don't follow that.     The Government is always altering people's conduct when it regulates them.                  Has it been done?   I mean, this is -- I don't recall any case like this.                 Are there other product liability cases that are removed from State court to Federal Court on a similar basis?               Mr. Gornstein, was there any Government litigation against the cigarette companies?
05-130 +++$+++            Is that all in Judge Bryson's decision?        I certainly didn't see it there.           I didn't see anything about irrebuttable presumption.        One of the problems with the district court exercising equitable discretion without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just the thing that the Federal Circuit was created to handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among district judges.         I don't know that it's only in Marshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction or in the other.         So the Federal Circuit is put there not to say that the district judges have no discretion, but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't have wide disparities, which you very well might have if you just say discretion to the district judges and very light review on appeal.        Well, isn't it a concern that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to? It says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to have to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them. It just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.
05-1342 +++$+++                If the national bank set up its mortgage operations as a division or as a department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?                  But let's -- there are two different kinds of regulations.                       I think Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a chartering State.     This subsidiary was set up under the law of a State.     It wasn't Michigan.                    Is there -- is anyone contesting that --was it North Carolina?                  -- that they have to meet all the requirements for setting up a corporation and having meetings and all that that North Carolina requires of corporations that are incorporated in that State?               Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are launching into?   My understanding was that you did not question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that it says can do what the national bank itself could do in the real estate business, no more, no less.              OCC regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that right?   It is one thing for you to say we have the authority to regulate.       Are you saying at the same time that OCC is out of the picture because its dual regulation conflicts with the inevitable?                  Ah, you're saying, you started to say they can't have their cake and eat it too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the requirements of both?              You do have -- one thing that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC in its primary jurisdiction sense.                 It says customers, if you've got complaints about what this operating subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given you an adequate response to your complaint, we take over.              So it's kind of a reverse supremacy.   Where it's usually the feds that have the last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling of the consumer's complaint?               Do you know another arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we will take over?   I know schemes that work the other way where the state goes first, and then the Federal authority, but do you know another one?               Where the primary adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal authority, but then the state can override that if it thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate job?                 Isn't the action an inadequate action?      Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal authority can do with respect to this unit just what it would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the other, but if the -- it is the state judging the adequacy of a particular Federal response.
05-1345 +++$+++                But in the majority opinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read it, on almost every page it uses words like "local operator," "local enterprise," "local proprietor," "local business," doesn't speak, as the dissent did, about a municipal facility.             It seems great care was taken in the majority to not characterize that transfer pledge as a municipal facility.                 I'm sorry.    At least as I read the Carbone opinion, it didn't deal with the public-private distinction.             It seemed to assume it was a private entrepreneur.         And it didn't take a position one way or another whether there would be a distinction.              But not -- you know, you have a whole string of commercial products, but you have recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal function. And you also say that the total, the -- what is it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't be any commerce problem, right?              But if it does something less, there is?
05-1429 +++$+++                   But that's not what this bankruptcy court thought about the claim.                    This bankruptcy court said some rather critical things.              And I don't -- there was never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay our workers' compensation.              I thought there was a section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.               Yes.               Correct me if I'm wrong --               In -- in this case, I thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, then the claim can be made and is not lost.               I'm talking about 502(e)(1).              In any case, this has nothing to do with the, Fobian, so-called Fobian issue, whether the Ninth Circuit drew the bright line.               But it would be proper to remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider those other arguments?               On both their statutory interpretation and the contract?
05-1448 +++$+++               I could understand that if the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a change to the multiemployer plan while the business is ongoing.   But in this situation, you, you say if the employer elects to have an annuity, then choosing which insurance company is going to supply the annuity, that would be a fiduciary function.               Well, this is, the termination, the merger that's proposed here, is instead of having an annuity we'll put the assets into this other plan.    It's quite different from choosing a form for an ongoing operation and saying, we're out of it and we're now going to try to distribute the assets in the way that will best protect the beneficiaries.                 Suppose the argument is made very forcefully that the insurance companies with these annuities haven't been doing so well, but there is this multi-employer plan that has been just performing so well, and so the -- an appeal is made to the company, you're going out of business, you're not going to be running a plan anymore.         Put those assets, distribute those assets to the place where they will serve the employees best.                 You're making the same rigid argument that Mr. Baker made, that whatever the termination, even though the company is going out of business, it's bankrupt, it's always -- a merger is always characterized as a sponsor business, not fiduciary.
05-1508 +++$+++                Mr. Van Amberg, they were essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they not?     And those regulations had gone through the notice and comment process.               I thought that the formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of Education, which is not something that Congress did in other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was doing.     But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's own language that Congress enacted?                 Well, just as to that, the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?               Well, as -- as far as the difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the later Secretary's decision to retain, as you acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation.               You said it didn't go through notice and comment the second time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in --               Yes --   -- and I appreciate that. But the text of it, what the regulation said was not significantly different from what the earlier regulation said.               Mr. Van Amberg, if there is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant consideration might be how would this work across States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different results from State to State depending on whether they have large districts or small districts at the top and the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils rather than school districts regardless of size, you would get uniformity going from State to State.              Mr. Van Amberg, could a State get to the same result?             Let's say your reading of the statute is the only permissible one.                 By combining school districts, it's no longer going to be the X school district and the Y school district, it will be the XY school district, and then the population would increase.   Still only one LEA.               Thank you.
05-1541 +++$+++                And why did the court point out twice in Williams that section 7426 was not available?               Because there was no levy.   It was only a lien.               But when Congress provides a special remedy for a particular class of persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more general provision.               The court took care to point out why those were not realistic remedies.              But here there is a prompt and efficient remedy.               It was a determination that the word taxpayer encompassed someone who had, in fact, paid the tax.       Here you don't even have that, because the tax wasn't paid directly by the EC Trust. The trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the Government levied on it, as distinguished from Williams, where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the Internal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax liability.               Well, the whole case was about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having voluntarily paid the tax.               Yes.          It was an involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that she was the taxpayer.                But you just -- you just pointed to situations where one to expect action to be taken promptly.   You don't want to wait to, to get an injunction against a levy because the Government might be there and levy on the property and then you're out of luck.   Where the incompatibility exists is post deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if you can get the longer statute of limitations under the general refund statute.               That's why the code has that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in fact four-years because you have to go to the administrative process first.             The whole purpose of the nine-months is to get people to act quickly.               And the Government -- and the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet title route she would have lost the advantageous -- she would have had to make.          She could never complete a quiet title suit within the time that she needed to execute this sale.                And the, and the opinion suggests -- not merely suggests, determines -- that those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it applies, were ineffective.            The Government raised other remedies and the Court said they were ineffective.
05-1575 +++$+++               But you are -- what you are saying is that it was sufficient when he said, I don't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence, and the trial court said, do you know what that means, and he said yes?              That doesn't have to be fleshed out at all, unlike a Rule 11 colloquy.                  To see if he really understands?           Do you know what that means, and he yes and that's the end of it?
05-1589 +++$+++                  Is it relevant, General Clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union? It seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the election process, because they left the same old Hudson in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have to do with elections.              But the State of Washington seems to think that's fine for everything other than election expenses.               Well, the content means a category of speech as opposed to what is the political position you're taking.               But I thought that that was content.   You could do it, say, in the press, but you couldn't do it over the air.
05-1629 +++$+++                   Mr. Himmelfarb, does the government urge that we consider the point that you're now arguing and the other points?                  You started out by saying everyone agrees that the rationale of the Ninth Circuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we are deciding the question as a matter of first view instead of review. Does the government urge that we dispose of those issues anyway, even though they were not disposed of by the Ninth Circuit?                  But it wasn't discussed by the Ninth Circuit, was it?                Why would it have to be raised in the Ninth Circuit?             I thought this case was controlled by a prior decision of the Ninth Circuit. Therefore, there was nothing more that was needed to take care of this case.                 How do we know that?            I was looking at, what is it, 13-A?                How do we know that that charge is as a principal?              In the appendix to the petition.               Even though that position has been widely criticized, I think.                    Is it the ALI Model Penal Code, which thinks it's a bad rule?               Mr. Himmelfarb, before your time runs out, there's something curious about this California statute.     This one is in the Motor Vehicle Code, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called car theft.    Do you know what the difference between those two and what would move a prosecutor to charge under the Penal Code as opposed to the Vehicle Code?               That's mentioned in what, 487(d)?               It covers joyriding?               Temporarily.               But in California they would?    Or is there a separate joyriding --
05-1631 +++$+++                  But Mr. Savrin, there was an episode in the parking lot where things came to a temporary halt.     If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would have slowed down.     If he was -- he was trying to flee from the police, but if the police weren't after him there is no indication that he would have been speeding.                Mr. Savrin, one technique that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb- sparing measure.    One oddity about this case is that he called and asked permission to use that less risky method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask permission to do what he did do, which was life-endangering.                Where is that?              And he said he gave permission for more than PIT procedure?                  How do you deal with the Brower case?   That it was a 193 -- 83 action against the police for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder. And the Court said that the roadblock was enough to give rise to a 1983 claim?                What is the, the court saying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition appendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers and when there, when there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed an immediate threat of harm to others. This is a finding that there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming occurred.
05-18 +++$+++               Is it?      Is it?   I thought the -- there was a reference to hours of consultants, but not expenses.           But it also found that there were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't Justice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on for a couple of pages, including footnotes?                     I think it was over 30 that did mention experts.                     It mentioned attorneys' fees and expert fees.        Mr. Salmons, there's one difference, a marked difference, between this statute and the others, and that is, in -- in many of these cases, it is the consultant that is the primary, perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent.                 There's not a case where they have these determinations, a lawyer is in the front line.        Even in this very case, wasn't it true that it was the consultant who was the aide to the parent and there was no lawyer on the scene?
05-184 +++$+++           What, in addition to this case -- I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme Court.       There are many cases pending in the district court when this law comes into effect.                What about those cases?            You've mentioned -- you've mentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before the tribunal.          What are the other rights recognized by all civilized people that these tribunals do not guarantee?
05-200 +++$+++            Can you go back and because the -- the parties seem to have different views about it?         I think you said it was required by OPM to have this reimbursement term, and the other side said that there was no requirement from the Government agency that you include the reimbursement term.           But that -- all that says is that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they were okay.          It's not -- it doesn't show that OPM required these -- this as a condition for Empire to serve as the insurer.               But there's nothing in the statute that speaks about a Federal forum.                     And if you look at this entire picture, you're seeking reimbursement, and you're seeking reimbursement based on a tort recovery.              And why wouldn't the most sensible, the most natural thing for a legislature, if they thought about it, be to say, well, that claim for reimbursement ought to come in on the coattails of the tort claim?              You don't need to make a whole separate Federal case out -- out of it.                    Why would Congress want these claims to be subject to a separate Federal case?             Well, it's because there's an anterior lawsuit that everything rides on that State court suit.              There wouldn't be any recovery from which you could claim reimbursement were it not for that State court lawsuit.               You don't have any such problem here.             There's no conflict between the New York law -- you certainly could have gone into that lawsuit and --        I could see if this were -- what we were talking about everything is -- the insurance of a Federal employee and questions about coverage, questions about benefits, all of that between the employee and the carrier.              But this comes up because we have a third party who enters the picture in an estate law claim.         So I don't think you can just say, well, everything is -- this whole thing is -- is all a Federal contract.           I thought that the -- the purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was related to benefits and coverage.                 Some States have mandatory coverage for this or that.                    The case that was mentioned is the chiropractor.                And the -- in the Federal scheme, the Federal administrator didn't want to be saddled with whatever the particular packages that the States had.          So the coverage and the benefits -- those were to be determined on the Federal level, and you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever the State thought would be good to have in the plan.             What -- you -- you might follow along with that perfectly well if you're talking about the beneficiary, the Federal employee, saying I'm entitled to a certain coverage or I'm entitled to certain benefits.           You would expect that suit to be in Federal court.            But why would you expect what piece of the tort recovery the carrier will get to be in Federal court?
05-204 +++$+++           What about having a --          What about having a -- a plan that was put in place by the legislature instead of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?          Isn't there -- isn't it -- you -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting instead of as the very first redistricting done by a legislature.             I thought there was --             -- I thought there -- the houses were divided.             One party, one -- had one house; the other, the other.              And so they were at loggerheads and they --          But the court -- even from the court's perspective, was it the same three judges that did the -- that did the plan, the court-ordered plan?       And I thought that the -- the judge who presided told us in his latest opinion that they never anticipated that as being a permanent plan, and indeed, they tried to stay as close as they could to the then- existing plan.
05-259 +++$+++             They say one lunch, but not if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who gets left out is the person who filed a charge under title VII.          That's -- a one-at-a-time curiosity the EEOC guidelines leave out, but if it's a routine lunch with all the preferred employees and they leave out the one who filed a title VII charge, that would fit within the EEOC's definition.            But it wouldn't fit under your --            Under your definition, lunch is lunch, and so there would never be -- there couldn't be --            Well, does it or doesn't it?     The -- the facts are simply that the manager takes out all the employees, except this one that filed the title VII charge, once a week.                 Is that --            Does it once a week, and I'm not using any adjective to characterize it.                    It just happens once a week.                 But let's get the --            What about the --            -- what about the Seventh Circuit case that posed the question of same job, same character of work, except that the employee had flex time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just changed to -- same job except it's got to be 9:00 to 5:00.       Would that fit within your definition?            Even though the jury has made a finding that the only reason that was done was in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.           Right.           But you would say that's outside --           -- that would be outside 704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for filing a complaint.         Just switch her from a work routine that she could easily manage and still take care of her family and to one that is impossible for her to manage.           Not -- not --           -- not every --           Not everyone, but only the ones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person from filing a charge.            And that would not be every trivial --           But that -- this is a peculiar effect on one person, but for most people --           -- most people it wouldn't matter.        But --                So you're changing your answer.        You originally told me that, no, that that wouldn't fit because it's the same job.           But it didn't --           -- it didn't cure.     I mean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?           Not just 2 weeks.    And she understandably experienced much stress in that time. She worried about how she would be able to feed her children, could she get them Christmas presents.                   That was -- there was nothing that she got, when it was determined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that compensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the medical expense that she incurred because she had that stress.           But when -- when somebody is suspended, it seems to me that is as tangible as it can get.         It gets registered officially.             This person is suspended, and if she doesn't do something about it, she's out.            But --            -- official action is -- is different from -- the problem with Ellerth was that if there's nothing formally that had been done, the employer -- this -- Ellerth was concerned with vicarious liability, nothing official.                   There had been none -- the boss wouldn't know about it.                    But somebody who is suspended, that is an official -- that's a tangible action.
05-260 +++$+++         Well, what about --        -- what about if you're -- if you're using Great-West, it seemed to me the most relevant point made in Great-West was that the plan could seek restitution in equity where money identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan could clearly be traced to particular funds in -- in the defendant's possession.           The problem in Great-West was the money had already been dissipated.                 It had been set aside.          Do you -- do you not think that Congress had in mind no compensatory damages, no punitive damages?          Do you really think that Congress had in mind the distinction that you are now drawing in the ring case based on 15th and 16th century English precedent?             Yes, but Great-West also said money.              It said money, identified as belonging in good conscience to the plan.                    And why doesn't it belong in good conscience to the plan when the beneficiary has promised that, if it gets a tort recovery, it will reimburse the plan?        What -- what is the double recovery that you're talking about?                    The plan has paid out to the care providers the benefits in full.        And now it wants to get back its benefits in full.        But the plaintiff could so -- in the tort litigation, if that's what it is, the plaintiff could say, I don't want any medical damages. Give me everything for pain and suffering.        Well, but they look at the medical expenses were something like $75,000 and the settlement was -- what was it?               $750,000.          How does the -- how does the insurer show that if the parties could just say -- the plaintiff can say, I am the master of my complaint. I am not seeking damages for medical expenses.               I just want damages for lost earnings, pain and suffering.
05-352 +++$+++            But in this -- in this case, Mr. Dreeben, we have a defendant ready, willing, and able to pay for an experienced lawyer in whom he has great trust.         He's instead stuck with a younger, rather inexperienced lawyer, and he says, that doesn't fit within my Sixth Amendment right.                   I have a right to choose the counsel that I want and not the one that the court forces on me.           But it was a junior counsel. As I understand it, the counsel that represented him finally, when the judge wrongfully refused to allow his chosen counsel to proceed, was one chosen as a junior by the more senior counsel, the one that defendant wanted.         May I, Mr. Dreeben --        But compared to what?   You haven't fully stated what you would replace the automatic new trial with.            And you said -- you started to say something about if the defendant could show that his preferred counsel would have pursued a different strategy.         Is that it?    Or would he have to go beyond that and show that that different strategy would have a greater chance of success than the strategy that was in fact pursued?          Does different outcome mean --          -- if the defendant is found guilty, he would have been acquitted?        You said you had -- you said you had -- your first preference would be --        -- different strategy and would have been acquitted with that strategy.              What's your other --
05-380 +++$+++              General Clement, couldn't a similar record be made with respect to what is the more common procedure, the D&E, that involves dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb.            So assuming you're right that it is constitutional for Congress to ban the D&X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning apply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with respect to what is the most common method for second trimester abortions?             Even though we are told by some of the medical briefs that the procedures are basically the same, they start out in the same way and that the difference -- the differences are not large in particular cases.              Mr. --                General Clement, that's not what this case is about, because I think you have recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking about whether any fetus will be preserved by this legislation.   The only question that you are raising is whether Congress can ban a certain method of performing an abortion.   So anything about infanticide, babies, all that, is just beside the point because what this bans is a method of abortion.     It doesn't preserve any fetus because you just do it inside the womb instead of outside.                 But if this case were limited to postviability abortions it would be a different matter.     But isn't it so that the vast majority of these abortions are going to be performed previability?              But General -- General Clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract. Wouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the vulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't bring a preenforcement challenge as to that.             Maybe it's a question of hemorrhaging, that -- it's a combination of what the condition is and the vulnerability of the particular patient and I don't see how that could be tested in advance.
05-381 +++$+++                Mr. Pincus, how do you determine the price of the logs?                 Because we, the charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to determine cost, that's one thing.                  But we are, also in this picture is that some of the logs came from Weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term contracts that it had, and those, the price was not inflated on those.      So if you take those into account you may get one figure, but if you take only the high bid logs you might get a different picture.                     So how, what is it?    How do you determine costs?                   Do you look at all the logs that were purchased or only the ones that were allegedly bid out?
05-409 +++$+++            Yes, but you must take issue with the this is only a quick determination, unless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice -- Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the Federal court is only two things.                It's either remand or dismiss the action.           That is, the Federal court under no circumstances will keep this case for trial. Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand.           Yes, but that was not -- certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding.           Mr. Frederick, as I understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory authority to do one thing and to do that one thing finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case that Congress has left over for the States still to deal with.          That was the whole theory of the Seventh Circuit, that this is no quick look.                      The -- the Federal courts are making a final determination.                       And I think that would exclude what Justice Souter has suggested.          Mr. Frederick, will -- would you please explain something to me that you just said?       You said that our complaint isn't about fraud. It isn't about deception.            It's about negligence.        But the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation, not mismanagement.        The -- the Seventh Circuit said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, despite the court's invitation that their suits allege mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation.                So is that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it in your briefs?        Then how could the Seventh Circuit have gotten it that wrong?            Of course, if the Federal district court says there is preclusion, therefore, case dismissed, that would be reviewable.
05-416 +++$+++           But that's the -- a function of -- you want the first-line decisionmaker -- you need that decision, because, at the second rung, in -- at the court level, deference is owed to it.                  But in the prison setting, there's no deference owed to it.                  So, I would think that this kind of requirement, that you must file someplace else first, a place that won't get deference, is more like the EEOC example and the Age Discrimination Act.             Invoke what?             Are you -- are you saying, then, that those two go together, they're inextricably tied together?            If you've got an exhaustion rule, then embedded in it is always a procedural default rule?            But that was a comment made when the decision itself held that there was no exhaustion.          The -- wasn't that so?             I mean, the holding in Madigan was in favor of the Petitioner.            I mean MCCarthy.           Well, there was -- in MCCarthy, itself, the wording was something that -- of the kind proposed.           And so, it's not clear whether it's referring to -- what was proposed was a rule that would incorporate a procedural default motion.                 It's not clear, just from the -- reading that opinion.         In thinking --         -- of what Congress might have meant, one part of the picture is, we're not dealing with statutes of limitations enacted by legislatures. We're dealing with grievance procedures that vary from State to State, and maybe even from prison to prison.                      And some of them have a very short span.                   I think the brief said some of them are 2, 3, 5 days.          May I --          May I ask you just one thing --          -- about how this operates and who reviews what?           One of the claims that was made -- this prisoner filed twice.              And, the second time, as I recall, he said, "Every day that I'm here, the clock starts running again, because this is a continuing violation.          I'm restricted today, and I'll be restricted tomorrow."          And there was no -- is that something that would be reviewable in court?        Well, what --        -- role would govern whether a continuing violation occurred?              Would it be --        And what is the law of the prison grievance proceeding on that point?        Well, he -- that -- his point is that the event at issue happens every day.        But your -- but your point -- your -- whatever the internal grievance procedure is, there's no judge that would decide that, which you said, this is all for the internal procedure.
05-465 +++$+++            I think it's -- it's a little more difficult in your case because you're pursuing an interlocutory appeal, which you were allowed to do only because you've got double certification and you got certification on the questions that the district court addressed.                You can't expand a 1292(b) order to include things that were not decided below.              And they weren't --              -- they weren't --              -- they weren't -- your problem is you don't have a final judgment.                   The only way that you can get even to the court of appeals is on that 1292(b) order.            And I thought that the function of 1292(b) was to say specify the questions that are so important that they have to be decided and appealed before there's a final judgment.                And whatever there might have -- whatever one might read into a question presented, I don't think that 1292(b) orders have ever been treated that way.        If -- if --        -- if Mohawk were a partnership instead of a corporation --         -- the partnership is an association of individuals.         So if the answer is yes, if Mohawk had been a partnership, you would not have this particular objection.         So it's only the corporate form.         That's --         Well, that's why I'm asking you about the partnership because it is an association of individuals.              So I'm not clear on what your answer is.          No partnership could be treated just like a corporation.          They're not an individual?            Or partnerships are okay because there's not a separate entity.        It's a -- it's a association of individuals.        No.     Would the --
05-493 +++$+++                  Do you think --                 -- that the jury in this very case understood that, given the questions that were asked?                 What about the -- what actually went on?    I mean, the jury first came in and said, "What if we can't decide?               Can we decide by majority?"   And then the question was asked, that seemed to indicate the jurors' understanding, that we take all those factors that you told us about, and we just take those factors into account.              And there were clarifying instructions asked by the defense that were not given.              Well --                -- California itself recognized that there was a problem here of jury confusion.   And now they have amended the provision so that it would be clear to any juror.                Where does this factor (k) come from?   What was the source of it?                  Well, the prosecutor's closing was schizophrenic, because he said, "But really this shouldn't matter."                  Yes.                 Mr. Johnson, when I asked you about the derivation of factor (k), you gave me a California statutory cite, but is there -- does it come from any model code?       Does any other State have such a provision?   How widespread is it?               How many States have an instruction that talks about extenuating the circumstances of the crime?               Which -- California hasn't had it since 1983, right?               California hasn't used this instruction since 1983.               So, is this a one-of-a-kind case?   I mean, you said, in your brief, that the Ninth Circuit decision threatens many other valid California death judgments.   But these would all have to be rather ancient cases.                  And --                  -- that wouldn't wash out, on the other grounds?
05-502 +++$+++               One thing that was left out of the succession of acts -- Utah provides for telephone warrants, and there was no attempt to do that.       Once they checked to -- to determine that there was probable cause to enter, they could have called for a warrant, but they didn't.                   Is there a reason why they didn't?             Are the police instructed -- the city police instructed about when the telephone warrant procedure is appropriate?             In connection with the answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then?                   If it's an ongoing crime, they can go in?                   It doesn't matter whether it would be a misdemeanor or a felony?                   It doesn't matter how grave the crime is?             This wasn't -- this wasn't a domestic violence case.               It wasn't anybody inside calling the police and crying, danger, rescue me.                   It was an outsider who complained about the noise.                  So I am wondering why you are emphasizing the prevent somebody from being hurt instead of they're disturbing the peace and the police have a right to protect the neighborhood.            It seems to me that that's an easier argument to make.           My point was simply that this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse.                  This was a neighbor saying they're keeping me up at night, so that the -- the police response was to the noise, not to the violence.
05-5224 +++$+++            Counsel, when you say --           But you did use the word inquisitorial, and there's one large difference, it seems.       This is not a magistrate judge or a police officer coming to a person for an interview.                This is initiated by the caller, by the victim, and it's initially a cry for help.               No, I didn't say that.               I said that the call was initiated by the victim.                It wasn't a -- a police officer coming to interview her.               You're splitting up two things that I think go together.                    That is, this is not just a call.             This is a cry for help.            You said -- you said we don't know, but you -- that's slightly in conflict with what you said earlier.               They asked 26 questions.    How long was this telephone conversation between the 911 operator and the victim?              But a simple cry for help that doesn't say I'm being battered may not elicit an immediate response on the part of the police.                       This kind of call, I need help now, and the information that comes with it is likely to be given priority attention as this very call was.          Is there -- is there -- suppose the defendant procured the witness' absence by a threat.          Then the 911 statement could come in.           Right?        But those are -- those are three neat legal categories.               The practical reality, is it not so, is that many women in these situations are scared to death of what will happen to them or they're so insecure financially that they think they have to put up with the battering?             So your neat legal categories really don't conform to what happens in people's lives who are in this situation.
05-547 +++$+++               Is it --              Is it -- if this is an ambiguous statute, do you -- what mileage do you get from Barrett?   There is certainly an argument that what was -- Congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of saying, "If there is analogous felony -- if there is analogous crime under State law, that should be included." And that made good sense.                 What --                 -- about the --             And that --             -- that period has how many months to run?             Do you -- you said you rely primarily on that argument -- do you have another argument?             On --             On collateral consequences, do you have -- what is your best authority to say that in -- it would keep this case from being moot?               Because --               Because the length of the sentence counts heavily in the attorney general's assessment, is that --
05-593 +++$+++               Why is it a wholly State law claim if the principal matter is whether this Federal employee is immune from suit?                That's the threshold question that has to be answered.                 It's determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get through that Federal law gateway before you can go any place else in the suit.             But that -- it's not it never happened as though the Federal employee was off in Hong Kong.   He was there on the premises.           He is claiming that whatever he did was within the scope of his authority.   It seems like it's a question of phraseology that you're dealing with.             Well, is it?   I mean, that's -- the problem that I have with your argument, Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it happened or it didn't happen.          There is a middle ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at the relevant time or place and when I was there everything that I did was within the scope of my employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the scope of my employment.               Suppose, Mr. Grant, that the district court had said, I'm going to deny the substitution of the United States as the defendant, but I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not going to order a remand until the defendant and the United States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling that I deny the substitution of the United States. Suppose that it had happened that way?               Would you have any right to get back in the State court?               Wouldn't that properly go to a court of appeals?             Well, suppose that happened, and then the court of appeals said the United States should have been substituted?            How about the defense of, I was on the job and everything I did on the job was within the scope of my employment?             But then you're left with this question Justice Scalia raised.               If it's ambiguous, an employee says I did everything within the scope of my employment, I did nothing improper.                They allege I did something improper.     I didn't.         I was a faithful servant.     The negligent employee will be allowed the Federal forum, but the one who was a loyal, careful employee has to be in the State court.               Does that make any sense?              This is an employee who said I never did one thing that was inconsistent with my Federal employment.
05-595 +++$+++               Could you give an example, General Chanos, of one that is other than Gideon?    Is there any other one, or --               And none other occurs to you?               Well, suppose the state has, which is going straight to AEDPA.                 Does that mean that Teague is out entirely, even the first category, that is a decision, a substantive decision that would mean that what defendant did was not a crime?               That's a odd position to take, to   proliferate proceedings that way.              I mean, I thought your argument, AEDPA argument, was:               Too bad, the Federal court is out of it, but the state court is most likely, recognizing that this Court has said what this man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief.                 But if you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow we can change the substantive proceeding into a procedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to proliferate proceedings that way.
05-5966 +++$+++                Well, what --            What do you make of the very name that the State gave, not acquitted by reason -- not not-guilty by reason of insanity, but guilty, except insane.           Guilty of what?        Guilty of the charge. And the charge is first-degree murder.                     So, even if insanity is found, apparently that's defined to be "guilty of the charge, except insane," therefore not subject to criminal punishment.             Mr. Goldberg, may I ask you to clarify one thing about your argument?                     You say that you should have permitted -- been permitted to introduce this evidence to show that this act was not - - the "act" being, kill a police officer -- was not done intentionally or knowingly.                     But you seem to indicate that Clark could have been convicted, under the Arizona code, of some degree of murder.                     Am I right about that?              And, if so, what degree?        And what would --        What --        What was the second -- the definition of "second degree"?        Well, what --        May I just ask, what -- if the proof you'd like to introduce is that the defendant considered the police officer to be an alien, why would he have any intent?         Why wouldn't your argument go, as well, to second degree?
05-5992 +++$+++              What about, Mr. Zas, that the court thought it was home free on the Speedy Trial Act?      After all, it had gotten a waiver for all time. Isn't that why the 165 days?          Who -- who could complain? Because in -- in all of these instances, it was the defendant who sought the enlarged time.                     In fact, even though the judge had given -- gotten this all-purpose waiver, he didn't give defense counsel as much time as defense counsel asked for to -- to investigate the genuineness of the bond.             As long as they're not in jail pending trial.          This -- this was a judge who apparently was doing this as a -- a matter of standard practice.          He had a form that he whipped out. It must be a very old form.                It looked like it was typed on a regular typewriter.
05-608 +++$+++                   Against licensees who are not claiming that the patent is invalid?                      And where is the controversy?                  I mean, I can see, if the -- if licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patentee says paying its royalties -- how does it --              If it -- if the -- if the -- if the licensee came into court and said, "I'm not contesting this patent," that would be the end of it, wouldn't it?              Why aren't you -- you said, "The only question before the court is jurisdictional." If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was used.   It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative defense.   And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction box, but you're left with the same underlying question.                But what --                -- good would it do?   Suppose we said, "Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it. It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c), affirmative defense"?      Then you go back to the Federal Circuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that, as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties, you have -- and they just put a different label on it -- you have --                -- you have no -- you have not stated a claim.               But then --               -- the Federal Circuit distinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee had stopped paying royalties.             Isn't that so?                How about --                Well, what are those ways -- I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities in the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the other that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped.                   Would that be effective?                So, you have rejected both of the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder might do to protect itself.               Do you have anything concrete that you would concede the patent holder could do?
05-6551 +++$+++              Why is that, why is that so? Why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the guideline -- what the guideline would indicate?                   And if a Federal court would say, if I sentence within the guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many courts have held.    Not this Court yet.                 That would be presumptively valid. And if I go outside, I have to give a reason that will survive appellate review.               Well, why isn't the middle sentence identical in function to the Federal sentencing guidelines advice?             What would you think would be necessary, what would be the least change California would have to make to bring its system into compliance with our decisions?
05-669 +++$+++            Mr. Lamken, the point has been made that there are many indications that what Congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court. In addition to finding this provision solely in title 28, the judiciary code, and not in title 5, there's also, if you read the following provision, 2416, time for commencing actions brought by the United States.           And then it tells us the tolling periods.          And, in doing that, it refers twice to the "defendant," which is a term that's used in civil proceedings, not administrative proceedings.            It's not the typical term used in agency proceedings to designate the responding party.               And the content --               -- the content of the tolling provision, as well, seems geared -- seems geared to a civil lawsuit.     It talks about a person being outside the United States; therefore, they wouldn't be amenable to service of process.   That wasn't part of the original statute, was it?               I thought that (i) was added because it's -- for a very specific reason, that there was a debate between the Department of Justice and -- I forgot the other agency --               -- yes -- about whether an offset would be subject to the time limit.               Your position is, this would apply to the universe of administrative proceedings.               Now, this particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an express statute of limitations.               So, what we're talking about, for the future -- what would change under your interpretation?   Not gas leases, because -- there's a 7- year limitation for both administrative orders to pay and --               -- court actions.
05-705 +++$+++          But the administrative remedy that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private right of action, or isn't it?              Would you get the same thing?    I complained to the agency, and say, I didn't get -- the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and X under the commission's regulations was supposed to pay it.                  So I complained against X.       Could I get before the FCC exactly what I could get in court, so that we're only talking about which form is proper, or is there a difference in the remedy?         And before the agency, you don't get counsel fees?
05-7053 +++$+++               Mr. Jett, do I take it, from what you've just said, that you are recognizing this is a question of Federal common law and not due process, so that if Congress placed the burden on the defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity? You're just arguing that this is the Federal common law?              You -- you -- then you think that Congress could not say that the defendant has the burden on the question of duress.           Mr. Jett, there's one piece of this picture that's different -- that distinguishes duress from, say, self-defense.                   If it's self-defense, you take a snapshot on the scene.                   You know exactly what happened.                No one taking a picture of these gun purchases would have any idea of all of this. And the judge, when asked to give -- to allow the defense of duress, said, it's frankly a close call in my mind, but when it is a close call, better give it than not. Now, he thought that the defendant would have the burden of proof.            Perhaps the judge would call that close question the other way if he thought he was saddling the prosecution with the ultimate burden of persuasion.           But that's based on the defendant's -- the prosecution's conduct.                   The Government's conduct in entrapment concerns how the Government behaved.           But if the Government is out there trying to achieve that result, it's quite different from the Government having nothing to do --             Do you take into account that this was not something that occurred at once? This was a long-term relationship.                      There were many opportunities in which she might have, when her children were with the grandmother, say, gone to the police.
05-7058 +++$+++               Mr. Andre, didn't you have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail. Then the answer attached every piece of paper that came up at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and then the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, I'm going to copy all those documents and make them my own. And nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the record made it plain that there had been exhaustion. The rule that you are opposing would operate that way. If you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't matter that the deficiency has been made up by the answer.   You go out.     Wasn't that the decision in one of these cases?              If -- if we accept your first two arguments, then if there is no heightened pleading rule and you don't have to name the specific defendants in the administrative grievance that you end up naming in the complaint, if you prevail on both of those, then isn't the third question, have you, what happens when you haven't properly exhausted, is really not alive anymore in this case, because you will have properly exhausted.     So why should the Court go on to answer what would happen if you hadn't properly exhausted?              But the Sixth Circuit obviously would have been wrong; if he has totally exhausted; they have, gave that as a no alternative grounds, but if they are wrong on the first one and he has exhausted.     That's the end of it.               That was the case where the, where the defendant estate, wasn't that the case where they put in all the papers from the administrative record?               Yes, but they were wrong about that.     If, if there was exhaustion in the case, and if there is no rule that you must name everything the defendant that you end up suing, if those two are established, again wouldn't we be dealing with a moot question?     Moot in this case?               And you have in one of these cases, the person has said:                I didn't know who was the person who said I couldn't have the operation until the prison identified him.               Yes.          So even if you had a rule, a reasonable rule, that named the people that you know, if you have it, that would not encompass someone?   In two of these cases, the defendants -- the plaintiff, the prisoner, said, I didn't know who those guys were until they were identified.              Is the no leeway built into the rule itself, that if you don't know --
05-746 +++$+++          Mr. Phillips, the fundamental problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the judge gave on negligence.       There was an instruction requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injury."           That was the only instruction objected to, because the refusal to give that instruction.     But you seem to be using that as a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which no objection was made.       Mr. Phillips, the defendant requested a charge on contributory negligence that read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to cause his injuries."            You didn't want the direct relationship, you didn't ask for that.            You asked for one that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in part to his injury."            Now you are saying that that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.         Perhaps my memory is faulty, but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were devoted to what instruction should have been given on railroad negligence.    You were dealing not simply with what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language. Instead it said directly caused. So that's the limit of what we can deal with, whether the in whole or in part should have been in the contributory negligence.      But it was your brief that spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for the railroad's negligence.         But you didn't object to the charge that was given on negligence.             You didn't object to the in whole or in part.          So that should be out of the case.         You're not taking them up on any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about what the proper standard was for the railroad's negligence.          What was wrong with the instruction, in your view of the case, that was given, instruction number 13, negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to cause his injuries?            Would you have in your ideal instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury, that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?            Would you?            But in your model instruction, in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in order to hold the defendant liable, you must find the defendant's negligence is the proximate cause of plaintiff's injury?            Even though almost universally, the term proximate cause has been criticized as totally incomprehensible to juries?
05-785 +++$+++              We're concerned here with the court of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that opinions of courts other than this Court have in determining whether law is clearly established. Do you exclude entirely from the province of what is proper for the Federal court to consider any court of appeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?           So that the only thing -- your argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then that's the end of it?             So would there be any difference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.
05-83 +++$+++           I thought the deadly weapon -- the definition of deadly weapon -- that that could include a revolver or a pistol.               You -- you seem to be describing now deadly weapon.               That's one thing, and that excludes guns.         And then firearm, a discrete category.         But I thought that deadly weapon includes at least pistols and revolvers.            But -- but didn't the deadly weapon -- definition of deadly weapon include firearms?            But with a 1 -- 1-year enhancement or -- I thought that that could apply in a case where the deadly weapon was a gun.        Would you explain again why it was irrelevant whether the gun was operable or not?          But to be a real gun, it has to be operable.          But all that the jury found was deadly weapon because that's all they were asked to find.          Why was deadly weapon put in by the prosecutor at all?                 If -- if you're right that this is not a deadly weapon case, this is strictly a firearm case, it's not a lesser included, here the prosecutor charged deadly weapon --          --    to wit, a handgun. And then the special verdict form doesn't say one word about firearm.           So couldn't the defendant expect, well, they charged the main thing?                 They charged me with deadly weapon, and they asked the jury to find deadly weapon.
05-848 +++$+++                Mr. Donahue, were there earlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the position that it took in this action against Duke?               But were they, in fact, enforcing that standard?        So that -- you said that Duke could have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at the time Duke started up its --             And the ambiguity is the word "increase," which could mean different things?             The Government as I understand it now has a proposed regulation that would align the standards with the two programs.           It would bring the nonproliferation -- it would bring the standard for the nonproliferation program in line with the new source performance standard.             Well, since the government is now taking the position that another Duke could do just what was done here and there's an enforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed in that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though it's those against the current government policy?             Could it bring it up by a declaration of non-applicability?           Could the new company -- how would it --
05-85 +++$+++                The district court thought it was and one we did, the district court said I have no authority in -- under -- over any of these people.   So back it goes.               -- talking that -- where are these statements?              But Thermtron was such a far cry from this case.         In Thermtron the district judge said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so I'm going to toss this case back to the State court.                 I don't think the court said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject matter jurisdiction.                 Why?          Why was it wrong when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district court said I have -- these people are totally immune from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.                 Did you request -- when the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was before the district court, did you request that the district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the case -- the question up on appeal?                 Because that would have taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay the remand to allow this question of law to be determined by the court of appeals.               Did anybody in this case -- did any of the Defendants in this case request a trial by jury?               And have they asked for it?   Has any party asked for a jury trial?               If not, that part of the case seems academic.               The case is settled?               Well, that's different than it is in the Federal courts.                You have to -- can't wait to the eve of trial to demand a jury.                  Osborn made it very clear that was an extraordinary case where Congress had explicitly ordered two conflicting things.                       One, it said no remand of a case of this type, and then it said no review of remands.      So the Court was as clear as it could be that only when you have those conflicting signals does that court -- does that case have any application.               Under the -- under the district court's view, would there have been original jurisdiction against Powerex?               Well, we don't know --                And Congress said, those entities don't get any immunity, they get two things: They get a federal forum and they get a judge trial. That's all that's at stake.                Are those -- have they been sued by the plaintiffs in any of these cases or have they always been brought in by defendants?
05-8794 +++$+++               You're envisioning that one case will take care of it.                   That is, if the Court rules against you, that's the end of it.                   You can't come back with another inadequacy because you'd be barred by claim preclusion. On the other hand, if the State comes up with an acceptable alternative, you agree to it.                   That's one thing.       The Court holds -- but there wouldn't be a second episode I think.              One way or another this proceeding would end it.              You said --              You said there were other States.        You mentioned California.               There was a proposal by the State.               It couldn't be executed.           What was the experience -- you mentioned a couple of other cases where the particular combination of drugs was successfully challenged, but then the State did what?           Well, what did they have? There was the Sims case.              No -- no -- certainly not in the legislation.         There's no rule that emerges.           But you did know that there was a lethal injection procedure that had been prescribed for another prisoner, and yet you didn't challenge the lethal injection at that time.              Why did you wait until so late?           Have they, in fact, changed the procedure for the lethal injection?
05-8820 +++$+++               But the Chief's point is that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being more than 90 days because then you would have, in addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert petition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of the petition, and the statute of limitations would be tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed 90 days.              Do you -- does your argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court, wanted to file the habeas application in the district court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it would be premature because the, the state application is still pending?
05-908 +++$+++                  Mr. Korrell --                 But can they have a race conscious objective?        I think that that's the question that Justice Kennedy is asking you, and I don't get a clear answer.     You say you can't use a racial means. But can you have a racial objective?                      That is, you want to achieve balance in the schools.                 But don't you agree that those cases left someone out of the picture entirely because we were talking about a selection of one person or another?    The word "sorting" has been used in this context because everybody gets to go to school.                   Indeed, they are required to go to school.                  So no one gets left out of the system, and I think there have been Court of Appeals judges who have noted.               We have never had that case before, not like the affirmative action cases.              Mr. Korrell, before your time runs out, I did want to clarify something about the standing of the plaintiffs here. Do I understand correctly that none of the parents who originally brought this lawsuit have children who are now pre-ninth grade, but that newcomers, people who recently joined, do have children of pre-ninth grade age?                But you don't dispute that membership, for standing purposes, the membership is what counts, not the association but the members?                Well, if it is a member, jurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what the membership was when the complaint was filed and not what it has become in the course of the litigation?              Yes, but the transaction case situation is different.               Suppose it was faculty, and the school district makes a deliberate effort to have members of the white race and members of other races represented in -- on the faculty of every school, so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit. That's their objective and they're using a racial criterion criterion to get there. Would that be impermissible, to have a mix of teachers in all the schools?               Well, what would be okay? How would you get there other than having -- the point I'm trying to make has been made by others.             Let me read from Judge Boudin's decision.              He says:      "The choice is between openly using race as a criterion or concealing it through some clumsy or proxy device." If you want to have an integrated school and you site the schools deliberately to achieve that objective, it's very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.                 Was the board simultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or attractive programs in the undersubscribed schools?
05-9222 +++$+++               Mr. Fisher, there's another potential impediment in this case and I would like you to comment on it.       That is the petition from the sentence, it was second in time.             There was a prior petition that challenged just the conviction, and under the governing statute, to have a second petition, you've got to get permission from the court of appeals and it has to meet stringent criteria. How do you get past that?             You went out concentrating on the petition addressed to the sentence which is a second petition.              So did -- then you are bifurcating the judgment in a criminal case, which is not the sentence.   You are saying there's an earlier judgment, and looking at it as we would as if it were a civil case, if you have a determination of liability, that doesn't give you a final judgment.              The judgment will come at the end of the case when damages are determined.            There were decisions going the other way.            Yes.
05-9264 +++$+++              We're not going to be able to do that in time to decide this case.             But what do we know about the dimensions of the Florida attempt crime?             For example, you have said it doesn't mean that you possess burglary tools.     Does it mean or does it exclude casing the house, walking up and down the street, around the block? When is a step substantial enough to constitute an attempt under Florida law?             What is that concretely? It's not possessing burglar's tools, it's not casing the place.     What qualifies as an overt act that would make one guilty of the crime of attempted burglary?
05-983 +++$+++                  They are an aggrieved party for purposes of the administrative process.                 The question is whether that -- when that is done, whether they also constitute an aggrieved party.                 And one of the -- one of the points made by the other side is that there is an express provision for proceeding without counsel at the administrative level, and there's no provision for proceeding without counsel in court. So doesn't that suggest that the right to proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?              But then you would be establishing a right for the least needy.               I mean, if they're seeking reimbursement, they're able to pay the private school tuition.        It's the people who can't -- who have no alternative, they have to take what the school district gives them because they don't have the wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school. And your argument, concentrating on the reimbursement right, would leave out those people, would it not?                Are you claiming that hiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase "at no cost to the parent," if they have to hire an attorney, that the cost --
05-996 +++$+++                But if he isn't eligible -- the new case determined that he was not eligible because his debts were too high.              He didn't incur additional debts between the time of the proceeding one and proceeding two?               Or he didn't reduce the debt.   If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court that he is ineligible, that is number one condition to convert into Chapter 13.            If you don't meet that condition, that's the end of the matter.               But now there has been a finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be eligibility.    And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's findings in the later case have preclusive effect?               But that's a question you can argue on appeal in -- from the recent decisions, but for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that determination, which I think would be preclusive on another bankruptcy court.             If the decision is affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think you could still argue that there's qualification for Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a determination that there isn't?               We have now a judgment that this debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13.           If that judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals, can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no preclusive effect?              What is the status of the Chapter 7 case?     I was under the impression it had been dismissed and a determination of no discharge had been made.              But there's a determination that you're not entitled to a discharge? That has been made.              Mr. Baker, couldn't the -- let's say the conversion goes through.            The first thing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7 converted to Chapter 13 is say:           I'm going to dismiss this suit, the -- the bad faith taint stays with the case, it doesn't get -- you can't erase it; and so back you go to the Chapter 7.       Why couldn't the bankruptcy court now sitting as a Chapter 13 court say:           We're not going to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad faith proceed in this court?             But here there was a hearing on the motion to convert, right?          There was a hearing?             And as I understand it, there was no objection to the character of that hearing? There was no request for an evidentiary hearing?          So there was a hearing.    Now, does that get wiped out too, just the way, the determination that you couldn't convert?
05-998 +++$+++                But you concede that the error would always be harmless if you have a trial before a petit jury, and all of the elements are instructed to be found by the jury?               Did the U.S. Attorney in this case oppose the motion to quash the indictment?               Yes.             But you're making the concession only for purposes of this case.              That is, in another case you would be free to say the word "attempt" is good enough; you don't have to spell out in the indictment a particular overt act.             Do we know -- do we have the grand jury transcripts, so do we know that, in fact, evidence was put before the grand jury that false identifications were presented at the border?
06-1005 +++$+++               It is hard to see this -- that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being concealed.   They're not -- the money that's being paid to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and necessary expense of the illegal business. So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete statutes, one with much heavier penalties.              That makes it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's the same conduct that's violating both.               What about the qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said, at least where the crime is a business-like operation? He gave the example of gambling, he gave the example of selling contraband. And it seems to me that he was narrowing his definition of proceeds to cases where the crime is not robbery or a one-time event, but a business-like operation.               Wouldn't it be --                Mr. Roberts, the Seventh Circuit in this case was following a precedent in another case and it thought that the defendant was would prevail under its theory. If this Court should say that that theory, that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit, your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a question that was not necessary for you to reach because you had your precedent on the profits issue?              Mr. Robert, may I go back to something you said about -- of the options that Justice Breyer mentioned. You said the way to handle it is in sentencing. Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering.                        You said the statute has been changed.                  So what would be the sentence under the statute as it now exists?                     And this is vastly disproportionate.             60 months for gambling, and 210 for money laundering.
06-10119 +++$+++                 Couldn't counsel at that point have gone back and said, ah, now I see what's going on, so I'm going to challenge -- I'm going to interpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second and third African-American?              Mr. Bright, the Judge was quite passive, and was -- was the judge, in fact, present throughout the entire voir dire?
06-102 +++$+++                Do you know any case, Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different U.S. court to get a different resolution?               Either one.               You -- you were urging that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do with the merits; but there is an argument that the existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.               Uh-huh.       Uh-huh.                  One question that doesn't even have to do with the issue before us.                      I'm curious about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there was in this picture an agreement to arbitrate.                      What happened to that?               There was an agreement to arbitrate.    And we're talking about a suit brought by one party in the United States, by the other party in China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although I thought the contract called for it.               Thank you.                  But the Gulf Oil case does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal presupposes that the forum is one in which there's personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue.                       It's just another forum is more appropriate.                Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, because your time is running out, there is a question about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and other conditions.    If the Court has no personal jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to impose such conditions; isn't that so?
06-1037 +++$+++               I think the Congress recognized that what they were protecting was not age as such, but old age, where in the other case they say it's the racial criterion and whether it's -- or the sex criterion, whether it's a man that's adversely affected or a woman it doesn't make any difference; Title VII applies to them both.      But the Age Discrimination Act doesn't apply to younger workers.                It doesn't say that you can't discriminate on the basis of age, so you can't prefer the older person over the younger person.               There is one little piece of it that seems, that clearly does favor the younger retiree.   And that's the -- what is it -- you're guaranteed, what was it, at least 25 percent of your final monthly salary.       That's not under -- for a regular retiree; and also this 10 percent that you get added on for each child -- that's not part -- that's somebody who is disabled gets that, but not somebody who is already a retiree.   Isn't that so?              I'm not sure that I follow that answer.               But let's take the one who gets over the five-year initial period.                  The disability pay when you no longer can be in the hazardous occupation, it will begin immediately, right? You don't wait until you get -- you're 55 to get it.
06-1082 +++$+++                   If this officer had complied with the State law, that is he had issued a summons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would apply if he went ahead and searched.                  So would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate State law, then the evidence can come in; but when they comply with State law, it can't.                 Would you agree that there was no probable cause to arrest, given the State statute?                 You're talking about probable cause to believe that he committed an offense.                 But was there probable cause to arrest?               Could he -- could this officer have gotten a warrant to arrest Moore?                 Could he -- is it -- oh, there's an offense going on under Virginia law, I'm going to check with -- call in to see if I can get a warrant.        Could he have gotten a warrant?               How could he -- how could he have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's a nonarrestable offense?               He couldn't -- would a judge have told this police officer -- they have a call-in procedure, call the judge.                 You want to -- you need to issue a warrant to arrest him for driving with a suspended license, but that's not an arrestable offense.                Did these officers think this -- those circumstances exist?                If you're right, Mr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it GVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who was drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles.               There could not have been a warrant -- a grant-- a judge could not have given a warrant for arrest on these charges.                 How often and under what circumstances is that Virginia -- Virginia law rule?              I mean, when does a general district court give permission for a custodial arrest in a certain class of cases?              Any crime at all?                  Any crime at all; jaywalking, for example?               Mr. MCCullough, there is one thing that I was curious about.                       It is this Virginia law that allows the custodial arrest pursuant to an order of a general district court.               When is that used?                What would be the basis of a --   can a district court enter such an order just because it thinks it's a good idea?                      Are there any grounds in --
06-11206 +++$+++                 What was the sentence for that?               But he didn't get any extra jail time?              I thought he did this four times.    I thought there were four.
06-11429 +++$+++                May I ask you a question before going on with this line?                You say that both the 802(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44 definition, right?      But was 802(13) ever applicable to this situation?    What was the law prior to the 1994 amendment?    There was a section, wasn't there, that defined "felony drug offense"?               Right.               Would you take a look at that provision that was in 841(b)(1)?                       Because it seems that it would be duplicative of 802(13).               Yes.               But read -- read the end of it.     Read on where it says, "or a felony under any law of a State or foreign country," et cetera.              Well, what --              But it defines what the felony is:   "A felony under any law of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana," et cetera.              Why would you need to look --              Yes.                Mr. Fisher, could I just go back to what you quoted.              Are you quoting -- you're quoting a Sentencing Guideline, right?                Not a statute.                  But, of course, they had to leave it on the books because they need a definition of "felony."   "Felony" has to be defined in many places, but this is a definition of "felony drug offense."                      So --                Just one.      You said that in most States what Burgess did, his crime, simple possession, would not encounter a sentence of upward of one year.   Did you do a survey?              Did you document that in your brief?
06-11543 +++$+++                   Well, in one way -- in one way it is, in that like those other crimes it presents a serious risk of potential injury to another. That's what they all have in common.                      It's a residual -- one argument that was made was when the statute was first drafted all it had was the residual, "presents a serious risk of potential injury to another."                      So that's, the argument is, that's what drives this statute, and then these, these specific crimes, were added just to be sure they would be covered.              I thought you said that you -- you look at the generality of cases.                    In most extortion cases what they want is money.
06-116 +++$+++                Mr. Waxman, going back to what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold the petition if there were -- if the attorney general filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to dispose of it.                But isn't it just the case -- you've made several arguments, but you have a case that's lodged in the court of appeals.                    It's not simply a petition there.         They have accepted it for review.                So in the normal course when you have a district court decision, a trial court decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment is suspended until the appellate court is done.                    So you have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace else until that judgment is entered.                    I think that's the essence of your argument, isn't it?              Perhaps you should go on to the merits.               And on that I have a preliminary question, because we have a new attorney general and the question is whether the new attorney general continues to oppose the legislature and the governor on this bond issue.             Do -- in other words, do we still have a case or controversy?
06-11612 +++$+++                Mr. Newton, you're not claiming in this case that the defendant was any way disadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the voir dire, are you?               But there was no objection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate judge.     There were no objections to any -- well, she didn't do the questioning.            She allowed the lawyer to do the questioning.              But there's a big difference between having a judge trial and a jury of one's peers.    The difference between having a magistrate judge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire doesn't have -- is not a question of the same dimension.              Well, we're not talking about a trial.    We're talking about the voir dire.              And perhaps you could tell me one piece of information.                   In the Federal proceedings that I've observed, it's always the judge who does the questioning, and this one seemed to me extraordinary.       The magistrate said it was her practice to let the lawyers do it, right?               You were referring a while back to the Gomez case.              And if I remember that case correctly, it was the defense counsel who made the objection to the magistrate; and there's nothing to indicate whether the defense counsel had done that in consultation with the defendant.                We don't have any idea what the defendant's wishes were, but it was the defendant -- it was the lawyer who raised the objection.              It was the lawyer's choice, and we have no indication that it wasn't -- it was anything other than the strategic choice of the lawyer.   And your position is that it must come from the client, and there's no indication that it did in the Gomez case.
06-1164 +++$+++                  I think in Contracts it was used as an example of a so-called built-in statute of limitations, one that is thought to bar the right as well as the remedy.                 It said determining when and under what conditions Federal courts can hear cases falls within the court's adjudicatory authority -- or that are within the adjudicatory authority are jurisdictional, when and under what conditions Federal courts hear cases.      That would be very broad, but it did say that. Could not interfere with the plain-text reading of 2501 once you assume --                 Then there would be a built-in limitation, and usually that's not considered jurisdictional.   It would be under the heading of failure to state a claim; that is, your claim has been extinguished, so you have no claim to state, as opposed to the ordinary operation of the statute of limitations which bars only the remedy, not the right.               Bowles said that.               Bowles said if it's equitably tolled, it's not jurisdictional.               If it -- a provision that is jurisdictional cannot be equitably tolled.               One member of the court did think that Irvin -- Irwin overruled Soriano, but only one member.               Is it just Irwin or a whole line of cases?       There was a time when the jurisdictional label was used rather frequently.                     There is a more recent case that says "jurisdiction" is a word of many meanings, too many meanings.                     And I think the Court has been trying to cut down on the too many meanings.              It did say statutory time limits -- this is Irwin -- applicable to lawsuits -- well, the sentence about the suits:                      The rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government.    It says the rule that was announced is applicable to the government, the same as with respect to private parties. So it's hard to think of what territory Irwin would cover if it doesn't -- because in all suits, at least for money against the government, there has to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.               Even if -- even if you're right, couldn't the Federal Circuit say:                    Well, that's all very interesting but Day v. MCDonough told us that if we want to raise it on our own -- we don't have to if it's not jurisdictional; but if we want to, we can.
06-1181 +++$+++               Can we consider that in your case, given that the application to reopen was made when there were only two days left to run for the termination of the voluntary departure time --                    in other words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?                Why isn't -- why isn't it fair to say:     You have the short time frame by statute to leave the country if you've left in voluntary departure.     Yet, the Government has provided reopening for all aliens.    Okay. Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to voluntarily depart within "x" days, you are relinquishing your voluntary departure status?                Isn't that a perfect reconciliation of the two?               But you raised the question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert petition.    The Government advised against granting on that question and limiting it to the question of having it -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary departure and moving to reopen.                 But it existed?     You're not saying something that came up later?                  What was the ground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by the first counsel?                Going back to the question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first, like any other removable alien.                And Justice Alito asked you:   Well, then he could be removed immediately, is that not so?   My understanding was, yes, that's so, but you can move for a stay of removal when you have a reopening pending.      Is that true?
06-1195 +++$+++               Mr. Waxman, how could that be, because the D.C. Circuit never got to that question?     The D.C. Circuit, as I understand it, ruled that there was no access to habeas, end of case. So the D.C. Circuit never examined the procedure under the DTA, did it?               So shouldn't we, if we agree with you, that there is authority in the D.C. Circuit, send it back to them to make that determination whether habeas being required, this is an adequate substitute.              But your basic position has to rest on Guantanamo Bay being just like if we had the detainees in, say, the Everglades.                    But do you concede that if these people had never been brought to the United States, if the facility were in, say, Germany, that these detainees would have no access to habeas, no access to our courts?              I thought this was decided in Rasul.    That's why I am so puzzled by the Government's position.        I think Justice Kennedy said it most clearly when he said that, well, in every practical respect, Guantanamo Bay is U.S. territory; and whatever Congress recently passed, they can't, as you pointed out, change the terms of the lease.
06-1204 +++$+++                  That's been pending how long?                 So it's from 2004 to 2008?               Mr. Rothfeld, will you explain then how it was that the Philippine Government supported the litigation against Marcos that led to the, what was it, the $2 billion judgment?               Said that it had no objection to that suit.          In fact, he thought it was a good thing for the Philippines that that litigation go forward.    But if the government's position is the judgment would be uncollectible because all of those assets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to Marcos's estate, so the -- that whole litigation would have been an exercise in futility.              There's one other point of Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs.                The Respondents say they have no right to intervene in the proceeding that's going on before the corruption court and your brief suggests that there is a right to intervene.   What is it?       Can they become part of that litigation or will they not be heard by the corruption court?              Seek to intervene, but no right to intervene?               In privity with the estate?   You're suggesting that the plaintiffs would be connected to the Marcos family that wants to get these assets?                 When you say "great weight," Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with Mr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?              Doesn't that depend on there being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in this case?               Isn't it also a requirement that in that proceeding in the foreign nation that all claimants would have an opportunity to be heard, which is not true here?              Is there any explanation why the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987 was simply allowed to lapse?
06-1221 +++$+++               What do you mean by that? You repeated several times there must be -- must lay a foundation.    You do recognize, I think in your reply brief, that some other supervisor evidence would be relevant and admissible, but you refer to the foundation. Tell us what you think a proper foundation would be.              What do you mean by "nexus"?    If they both work in the same physical facility, is that a nexus?               And didn't the Tenth Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition?                 That it must be the same supervisor?            "'Similarly situated' requires proof that Paul Reddick was the decisionmaker." That seems as though that the district court thought there -- it must be the same supervisor, and I thought that's how the Tenth Circuit read --               -- the district court.               But that didn't present the other supervisor, which I think is more -- a better way to comprehend this, because "me, too" could be 10 witnesses working under the same supervisor.                   But these two people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain of supervisory command.               But that's not "other supervisor."    They are both supervisors of this employee.    She's in a unit that includes both superior officers.    I thought that the issue here was simply other supervisors, witnesses who had worked for other supervisors, people for whom the -- with whom the plaintiff had no connection.                  But you say -- I thought you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor evidence could be relevant.              I think you said in your brief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a foundation.    And that's the difference between you, I thought -- with respect to Justice Kennedy's question. Your brief takes the position that it is not necessary to lay a foundation in order to introduce other-supervisor evidence.               Mr. Garre, do I understand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit thought that the district court was ruling under 401, making a relevance determination, was that the court of appeals had a precedent in the area of employee discipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the district court was following that precedent, but that precedent doesn't apply in this situation.                    So that's why the court of appeals, as I understand it, read the district court as just applying an absolute ban.                But the -- how can we make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know why this district judge ruled as he or she did?                       We had a precedent.     It -- it dealt with employee discipline. We said, categorically, it's got to be the same supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant. The district judge was simply applying that case to this case.                So it wasn't any 403 question.    It was this doesn't some in.                But that's not -- the point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an absolute rule:    It doesn't come in.                     We know why he made an absolute rule; that was our precedent.               Do you not think that there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute bar?   If we just assume in favor of the district court, when we don't know that the district court didn't take it as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law that should be clarified for the benefit of district courts.    Either there's a categorical bar or there's not.               The -- the Government said it was not necessary to lay a foundation. Mr. Garre confirmed that point.
06-1249 +++$+++                Mr. Waxman --               It didn't say -- it didn't say IV across the board.              It said IV push is the claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was aware of the IV use and a certain risk.                   But did it ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV administered the usual way by a drip bag?               But that doesn't answer the question of was it -- the risk of gangrene and amputation is there.       No matter what benefit there was, how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?               Mr. Kneedler, at the outset, would you clarify something that is central, I think, to this case?     Some of the briefs tell us that this represents a change of policy on the part of the FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's own efforts to protect consumers.               They helped because they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that were either unknown or under- evaluated.               Was that once the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?              But why is that -- why is that likely, considering the huge number of drugs?              I mean, one figure said that there are 11,000 drugs that have this approval.      Is the FDA really monitoring every one of those to see if there is some new information that should change the label?
06-1286 +++$+++                Mr. Rubin, you were not willing to agree with the Chief when he said:                 Well, maybe there are some investment expenses that are special because this is a trust.                 But there must be some that any investor would incur.                But you say it's got to be all one way.              Is that true?          And I'm looking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986 when this measure was before Congress, and in that written testimony is the statement:                      "First, the treatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a separate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be taxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained direct ownership of the trust assets or given the assets outright to the beneficiaries." So apparently the Treasury was telling the Congress that there is a problem.              A grantor trust would be one of those pass-throughs.               Why is it not administerable?   Whether you think it's a faithful rendition of the statute is one thing, but this is exactly what Justice Breyer was talking about.                 It says these are the things that are special to the trust, and then these are the things that are not.                 That's what the proposed reg does, right?               As far as a tax return, are there accountants this specialize in trust tax returns as opposed to individual or corporate returns?
06-1287 +++$+++                 There's something not quite right about that.        Wasn't all the evidence submitted, but the district judge said, I have all the evidence, but I can't consider.              It isn't a question of introducing new evidence when it goes back.                     It's a question of looking at the body of evidence that was submitted.              Could the district court appoint a special master to help her?
06-1321 +++$+++                Why?          This Court hasn't so held.     We haven't had that issue before us.              Did the government -- well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind of qualified that in their brief.                 The brief says that the case -- this case presents no occasion to consider whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private sector retaliation ban.         So they haven't made a concession.                 She could complain; it's just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.               Why is that so clear, because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall govern civil actions brought hereunder.                 And if there is no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't be applicable.                It isn't that simple because the government hasn't conceded that, with respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for retaliation.   If the Government -- we'll ask them -- will make that concession, then the argument is very strong.   The words are identical.
06-1322 +++$+++                Well, why don't we do exactly that here?      I mean, you say that the proper thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60 days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated.                      Why shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we have a proper Form 5.        The employer didn't get a chance to engage in settlement.           So we hold on to the case and allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is there.     Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this case?              But you said the same complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation. What difference does it make that you have a piece of paper there? What I don't understand is the only effect of your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days, start over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an additional filing fee.        The complaint has already been filed.   The filing fee has been paid. Now, everything would work out just the same except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee.                     In the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first dismissed and then they have to docket it again.                  So I don't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to me.               After she had a lawyer. But is it -- is it not the practice at the EEOC when you're dealing with an unrepresented person who files the intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks that it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be filled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC officer herself?               But that's not the question.     The question I asked is if they decide that the, what the intake -- the information on the intake questionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim can go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the layperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do it itself?               Well, it has to be signed.               Well, she filled out hers after she was already in court and had a lawyer.                But I thought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC administers, are designed for claims that are put forth initially largely by unrepresented people.               And the notion is that the agency should make it as easy as possible for them to get through the legal process.                What happens -- what happens if -- in this case it's not a problem, but I can imagine it would be in many cases -- - if you have a 300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are totally out.   That's why it's important not to follow -- to say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if we dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days. Well, but 60 days may be 360 days.              Wasn't she appealing?              Wasn't she appealing the dismissal?                Well, I don't understand that, because EEOC is a responsible agency.                      Congress has told it:    You weed out the people complaining about something that happened in Paris, and then you give notice.   But the notice obligation -- and I understand it is EEOC's, not the complainant's.                    So we would not expect this agency -- yes, it messed up in this case -- routinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage the employer in conciliation efforts.              What about the new form, the EEOC's new form -- I suppose responsive to this case and others like it -- that says if you don't file any other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake questionnaire as the charge?                 If the EEOC treats it as a charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice.                 Where -- where does it say if you don't file it's only --                 Yes.                 That's the new form.                 And where in the form that --                 The new form does say that, that if no other paper is filed, this can be treated as a charge?               Do we know whether that's true in this case?               Do we know whether -- I mean the difference -- what you are suggesting would be perfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is a lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever, but you would be under exactly the same disadvantage if the time lapse has meant that employees have left, that you have -- you have removed evidence as old and disposable.    It wouldn't -- you would -- on your scenario of what would be the right way to do this lawsuit, you would be -- you would suffer the same disabilities in terms of documents and witnesses.              If she had the obligation to give notice, you would have a much stronger argument, but the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on the lay complainant.
06-134 +++$+++                But what New York is seeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest in the land.     It runs with the land, doesn't it?                 The counterclaim sounds to me very much like it comes straight out of the Federal Rules, not out of any convention.                       It's the same transaction and occurrence, right?                 Well, that's exactly what it says in the Federal Rules about compulsory --               There was nothing vague about the State Department's brief in the Englewood case.               But anyway, at a time closer to the passage of the Act, the State Department was taking the position that a lien was an interest in land.               And in reality, you will never get there, because the Vienna Convention deals with the substantive liability -- you're talking about jurisdiction.     On your theory, you would never get to the fee for picking up the garbage, because you wouldn't have any jurisdiction.               The commercial activity, it's applied to that same building that you say can't be -- it can't be any suit for taxes.               Even -- even if this, the building were only the mission and the representative, the minister to the U.N., even then --               -- the water of a municipal service, garbage collection, could be charged.                 Well, it's the city.   Not a private company, the city itself.              You could easily say there has to be a relationship to the property itself.               In a very practical way, you're expressing that right means ownership means ownership.    But the title is certainly impaired by this lien.    India could not turn around and sell it to anyone without doing something to discharge the, lien right?               So the title is certainly clouded by this lien.               How long did the United States take the opposite position and when did it change?               How long did the United States adhere to the position that's reflect in the Englewood brief and when did it change?
06-1413 +++$+++                You are saying to me, Ms. Brinkmann -- we talk about an asset, an investment. This was one company.         This -- it's strange to talk about unitary basis or investment.                    This is a division of one company.      And we are talking about a sale of assets.   Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary. So what more is there than this is one company, it sells some of its assets?                 Do we have any cases -- do we have any decisions that go against the state taxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to subsidiaries?               What is -- what does the domicile State -- we have Ohio.              But you say as a matter of constitutional law, not State tax policy, as a matter of constitutional law, the only State that has authority to tax the capital gain is Ohio?               Does Ohio -- would Ohio give credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is due?   What is, in fact, Ohio's tax law in this respect? Does Ohio give credit to taxes paid by other States -- to other States?               Can I have an answer to a very simple question?       If Illinois claimed the tax, would Ohio give credit for the tax paid in Illinois?               Do we know what -- what Ohio does in these situations?               Why isn't the answer both?    Why isn't the answer both, just as here it is both a paper or office supply company and a Lexis/Nexis, electronic data company?                  They're raising it in -- in support of the judgment.              So if it's novel, but it supports the judgment, then at least shouldn't the Illinois courts have a chance to look at it and say, oh, that's what we really meant, we just got -- explained it the wrong way?              It was a sale of stock in that case, wasn't it?              It was the sale of a subsidiary.    And here we have a sale of assets of one company, and that's why it's so hard for me to see this, as, why are we talking about unitary or not?              There is only one company; it's Mead.              You told me that there was no case that the tax -- taxing authority lost that involved divisions of a single company and sale of assets, rather than the sale of stock.               Well, we're talking about what Due Process permits States to do, and you're asking us to declare a restriction that, as far as I know, has never been declared in any case.               It's not just that it's an investment, it's not just that it's holding on to the shares in another company.         It's both of these are ongoing businesses, Lexis/Nexis and Mead, and they are both generating income, and all along Illinois has been taxing the income of both of them, right?                  Weren't those foreign corporations?                  So running them as -- as a single company would have been a little harder.                Yes, there is, Ms. Brinkmann.   The Illinois appellate court never got to that question.   Illinois argued all along this is a unitary business.     The only one who said it wasn't was this trial court, and the Illinois intermediate appellate court says, well, we don't have to deal with that because if you use the other label, operational function, that comes out all right, too. But this argument was certainly the number one argument that Illinois was making.                    It lost only in the trial court on -- on it.              And the appellate court said we don't have to get to it.                 So I think your answer to Justice Souter really wasn't accurate because it isn't --                All we know is that a trial judge said that was so.               Maybe when we're talking about Due Process and Commerce Clause limitations on what States can tax, we ought to ask ourselves if those three -- is that it?      If we're trying to measure, is there a sufficient relationship between Lexis/Nexis, Mead, and the State of Illinois to make it fair for them to tax? And you say, oh, yes.               Each year when they're making income, when they are a going concern, Illinois can get a piece of it.               But when the assets are sold, assets that would have generated income for Illinois year after year, but when those assets are sold, Illinois can get nothing to represent -- to substitute for that stream of income that it would have gotten.              But Lexis/Nexis is gone.              Suppose it had been Delaware, and there was nothing there in Delaware except it was a Delaware corporation.               Ohio.
06-1431 +++$+++                "EES-ter-brook."              Are you saying that before the 1991 amendment retaliation was included?              Why isn't that true here? Because we're not talking about retaliation in a vacuum; we're talking about retaliation for complaining about race discrimination.              What kind of -- what kind of right to be free from discrimination would there be if once one complains one can be fired, demoted?                 That would not be a very effective right, would it be?                But one can say the same thing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act.                 There are a lot of overlapping antidiscrimination laws.                 That doesn't mean that we shrink one because another exists.                Well, that's -- that's often the case, isn't it?          I mean, the argument you just made could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to complain about a racially-based demotion wasn't able to use Title VII because he filed too late.                That's a typical use of 1981; is it not?               So what is the difference between this case -- you say, well, there's Title VII and this would erode Title VII.             Doesn't it erode Title VII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?               And you say --              Of course, it's just for race claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin.              My point is that 1981 would not be available to other categories.                It's only race, right?               But it's a statute that has the same derivation.         They're both from the 1866 Civil Rights Act, and they're both set up the same way. 1982 also says "same" as 1981 does.                     So wouldn't it be odd to take these twin measures and say one includes retaliation and the other doesn't? Wouldn't Congress, when it revised 1981 in 1991 been aware of Sullivan and expect this Court to interpret those twin statutes the same way?               Wouldn't you look at what Congress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments?                   That is, Congress changed the law that this Court had declared; and the message, the essential message, was this Court has been too stingy in its interpretation of Title -- of 1981, so we're going to change it.                 And it seems to me that we wouldn't be hearing -- we wouldn't be grasping that message.                 There is something to that effect in the legislative history that explains why Congress made the amendments it did in 1991.
06-1456 +++$+++                 If he were a courier bringing the marijuana into the United States what would be the crime and the penalty?                If he was bringing marijuana into the United States instead of returning with the proceeds?               But now he possesses money.   And you're not saying this is innocent behavior. It is criminal behavior, so what is the crime if not money laundering?               But that requires knowing that it's illegal to take out more than X amount of money, and there's nothing that indicates that the common courier would know anything about such a provision.                 And it doesn't matter for purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal. It could be perfectly lawful money.              It sounds like he was making the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge make between -- the dissenting judge says transporting to conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is okay.                Why isn't it simply to change the nature from being drug money to look like it's apparently innocent?            I mean the change of the nature -- the nature going in is it's always dirty. It's drug money.     And the purpose of the concealment is to get it converted to some different nature, i.e., clean money. Isn't that what "disguise the nature" means?              And if he -- if he didn't know about the currency-reporting requirement, then he's not guilty under that statute because it requires knowledge.              If he's not -- if he doesn't fit into either category, then there's no crime?              Would you say the same thing for -- if you just put it in a safe deposit box in a bank in the Bahamas?              The point -- the point about aiding and abetting something, this money reeks of marijuana, and that was very puzzling to me.                    Why this is the standard operating procedure to take this money and wrap it in containers that had contained the drug. So when the police find it, they know it's drug money.
06-1457 +++$+++                  But FERC thought it could live with the Ninth Circuit's decision, because the government recommended that we deny cert in this case; isn't that so?               But, Mr. Kneedler, this is a decision, the Ninth Circuit decision, that empowers FERC.   FERC says:    Oh, we don't have that authority. And the Ninth Circuit said:               Yes, you do.        So this is an agency arguing that it can't do what the Ninth Circuit says it can.     And why can it not?               Because of two decisions of this Court.           Is that right?                  I thought -- let's go back a step.   I thought FERC's position was:                    We could not decide as a matter of discretion to do this because we are limited by those Supreme Court decisions.                  So it's not what FERC -- FERC independently interpreting the statute to reach the conclusion, which it might, to reach the conclusion the Ninth Circuit did.      It's FERC saying:                 We can't do that because we have our marching orders from the Supreme Court.               Did the companies who were involved in this case make those reports?                  I mean, there was something about during this energy crisis there was rampant noncompliance with the filing, with the quarterly report filing.               Mr. Kneedler, I do have one question.   It was the position that FERC took in December of 2000, when it was encouraging the entrance into the long-term contracts rather than using the spot market, and in that order FERC said that it would monitor long-term contracts vigorously for rate reasonableness and that buyers could challenge rates through 206 proceedings.         What happened to that position?                And how did FERC monitor the rates vigorously to make sure they were reasonable?                 Well, those decisions are puzzling transposed to this setting, because in those decisions it was the seller who had made a bad bargain; the price was too low; and the seller wanted to get out, right?                 And now we are transposing that.     And one of the main themes I think of Justice Harlan's decision was this Act was meant to protect the consumer, to make sure that the consumer wasn't going to be overcharged.               And that runs through those two 1956 decisions, at a time when there was no market-based authority, or any such, right?              That's the same order where they said we are going to monitor the rates for reasonableness.                You said the Commission is on the job, but one of the pieces of information here is that the Commission staff said that the dysfunction in the spot market carried over into the forward market, such that prices in the forward market were inflated.               Mr. Dellinger, wasn't the staff saying something more than that in that -- in that report?               But the Commission didn't -- didn't respond to the staff report, right?              Didn't say anything one way or another about it.               Did they say it with respect to the staff report?           Or -- I thought they thought the staff report was irrelevant?
06-1463 +++$+++                Well, you may have a right to go to arbitration under this context, to proceed at once to arbitration.              But could you stop a parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor Commission?    In other words, your adversary says under the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't do that.               Could the arbitrator decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the arbitration?               Take out the exception. The arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have the advice of the Labor Commissioner because the arbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency arrangements.              I thought Buckeye was -- was such a case, going to court despite the arbitration agreement.                 But this is not a proceeding brought by the administrative agency.                 An agency like the EEOC Waffle House.               This is somebody who's bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor Commissioner commencing a proceeding.
06-1498 +++$+++                 Mr. Phillips, isn't -- isn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance, right?               -- drug manufacturers, we are going to give you an invigorated defense.                Instead of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld information or misrepresented information. It seems to me that what -- you could say this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory compliance defense. So why shouldn't it be looked at as the second, rather than the first?                If you're right in your argument, the Michigan statute provided two things:                 One good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a qualification on it.       It seems to me that those two can't be unstuck.     So to strike out one, as was done in the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these two things together.                Mr. Joseffer, let's assume that -- that you're right.                The Second Circuit, because it thought your position it was wrong, never got to the severance question.          It had been decided by some intermediate appellate court.               But would it not be appropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on remand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification process to say, well, we want to find out from the Michigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet stays, but the bitter goes?                I didn't think that the Second Circuit discussed severability, but I can go back and check.                I thought that it had been raised there, but they didn't get to it because they --                In a very, very quick -- it isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion.                    It's a is very -- it's just one paragraph.                I mean, because it is odd -- I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that says:   Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity, but there's an exception.            They seem so tied together and it really would be a case of letting one side keep the sweet and get rid of the bitter.                      And it seems to me that there is -- that there was no discussion of that in the Sixth Circuit.                  But the question is whether the legislature would have passed the statute that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer could have the immunity without the exception.                  It would be -- it would be open to the Second Circuit on remand because it's not foreclosed.               The government told us in its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing public complaints -- this was in their brief at page 24 -- because that would divert attention from their primary mission.   So there's no action for fraud that one can bring to the FDA.               But The FDA doesn't have to do anything about it?
06-1505 +++$+++               Mr. Russell, this is the problem that I have with your double inquiry.                 First, you decide business necessity.              Then you decide reasonable factor other than age.                Once you determine that there is no business necessity, there is a readily available alternative, so what you're left with is a pretext for age discrimination, what -- what function is there for anything else to perform? I mean, I understand the business necessity, whether you have it pre-1991 or post, but I don't understand putting this other test on top of it.                 It sounds like you're making it harder for the -- for the plaintiff.              The expression comes from the Equal Pay Act, with a substitution.                In the Equal Pay Act it's "any other factor other than sex" and here it's "a reasonable factor other than age."                And my impression is that that formulation in this Equal Pay Act has been rather problematic.              First, you have to find there is a differential between the pay of men and the pay of women, so -- and then you go to any other factor other than sex. Are you suggesting any different analysis for the age category than for the sex category.               Your point that it's sandwiched between two things that are clearly affirmative defenses, BFOQ, the employer has the buried of production and persuasion.               And I forgot what the third one --              Is also an affirmative defense.     So I take it your point is why should this middle one be any different?              But the argument was that EEOC never spoke to disparate impact?              The problem is that you would be making this provision more generous to the plaintiff than -- for example, in Title VII the defense is business necessity; the employer has the burden of production; the employee has the burden of persuasion. Here you'd read -- you're saying you come into the covered category, you were shown because of age through impact, and then the burden -- the total burden is on the employer. Am -- am I making myself clear here?
06-1509 +++$+++               Well, perhaps because -- because the Government might very well be on the other side of that question, that is the dominant shareholder takes money from the corporation, gives it to his girlfriend, and the Government is saying that corporation had earnings and profits, we want to tax this as a dividend to you.              Yes.                 But you did say something about the interception that -- your argument is that this corporation had no earnings and profits, so what the shareholder got was a return of capital.              But part of what was involved was he was taking, I thought, receipts for goods that customers were -- had paid and giving them to the girlfriend. In determining whether that corporation had any earnings and profits, wouldn't you have to credit the corporation?    In other words, did you prove that there was no -- that there were no earnings and profits? You would have to prove that, wouldn't you?               What about the -- the Government did say that this accountant -- what was his name, Monango, or something like that?               Testified at the trial that there was no return of capital in the relevant year.              Do you recognize that he would have the burden?       If he said this corporation had no earnings and profits so what I got was a return of capital, it would be his burden to show that?              Coming forward, he had the burden of coming forward?
06-157 +++$+++                   If this -- if Congress had enacted this executive order that's in question here, if it had been congressional legislation, would there be standing?               Taxpayer money.              Would -- you've covered the case where the Government itself, the executive is the actor and said that's not covered by Flast.                     But it is covered -- what is covered is if the give the money directly to the religious organization. If the money goes instead of to the Government -- take this case, if the conferences are run by a private contractor -- contractor with the executive, where would that fall?                  This claim, these conferences are run now instead of within the executive branch by various agencies, they are run by contractors, specialists in conferences that have been engaged by the executive to help people make grant applications.                  That's --that's a question on the merits.          Right now we have to take the allegations of the complaint on the merits as -- the allegation is, I take it, that religious organizations are being favored over secular organizations; but that's a merits question. You've -- you've -- you have been clear that if the Government itself spends the money, then there's no standing.   You've, you've been clear that if it gives the money to the religious group, there is standing. Now money is going outside the Government. Going outside the Government.               But is not going to the religious organization.       Where do you fit that?              The difference was that it was because it was under the property clause, and made a distinction between property and money.              We are talking about money, not property?               Was it just --               Was it just a ministerial act or did the Executive have discretion involved, about who would receive the grant?                But you can reconcile Valley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the Federal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation or a specific appropriation, it is money from the Treasury, and that's what Flast is about.               Because whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive program, which you have said can violate the establishment clause as well as a congressional program. So why isn't that the line to draw based on Flast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the difference?                You're talking about an incidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program is quite different from looking at a discrete program. The Faith-Based Initiative is a discrete program, and one component of it is this set of conferences.                    This is not an incidental something pursuant to a large regulatory program.     Faith-Based Initiative is the name of this program.
06-1595 +++$+++               Mr. Schnapper --              But why are we -- why are we spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so far from this case?      This was a person who appeared at an internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very specific testimony.      She wasn't saying:              I'm against harassment.    She said:      This boss harassed me.            It is about as specific as you get.              So we're dealing with a particular case of somebody who was a witness in an internal investigation.         Why do we have to reach the outer boundaries of this claim in this case?               But I thought that the -- real case -- the real case that we're dealing with is somebody who appeared in an internal investigation, and I thought that what was the debate between the two sides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in the investigation, I thought that the other side's position was, well, this is not an "investigation" within the meaning of the statute.   That what goes on internally doesn't qualify. "Investigation," "proceeding," or "hearing" under Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII charge.   I thought that that's what the controversy we're talking about today is about:                      Is this a qualifying investigation?              The -- the other side says this is not an investigation.                  There was no charge filed.   She's filed no charge.              So this is not a qualifying investigation.           What is the government's position on that?
06-1646 +++$+++                Does it matter what was the sentence actually imposed in the State court?              That is, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor chooses not to charge as a second offender and so, although it is in fact the second offense, he is sentenced in the State court as a first offender.            Would it count under your reading of the Federal statute that it was a second offense?                Do all States treat first convictions from other States -- do they all count for recidivism qualification if the prior offense was committed and the conviction was in another State?
06-1666 +++$+++               There's another difference, too.    There was a conviction and a sentence in Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as far as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts, certainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the conviction has been quashed.               Mr. Garre, just to clarify one point.      The -- at the time of the briefing, the U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of 2007.   Has it been renewed.              Mr. Garre, it is at least equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was going on its lack of power "to review, to affirm, set aside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed" there.    And here we have no judgment or sentence. So I don't think you can pick one of these strands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it isn't the judgment and sentence.                 So I think we know your position.    This is an opinion that says "under the foregoing circumstances."            I don't think you can take it much further than saying citizenship was one of those circumstances.              There are --              There are in the U.S. custody a number of non-citizens.                  Is that -- how many people are being held in the custody of the Multinational Force that the United States controls?               But the Court certainly listed it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's the only thing that's repeated in the opinion.                But I think that we've come to a standoff on that.              There's an important distinction, I think.       At least in this case it has been alleged that if these people are released to Iraqi custody, there is a high risk that they will be subject to torture and other abuse. You know the brief that was filed on behalf of the NGOs where there is a quotation from Iraq's deputy justice minister:          "We cannot control the prisons.   It's as simple as that.                Our jails are infiltrated by the militias from top to bottom, from Gaza to Baghdad."              This is a quotation from the deputy justice minister.               I didn't see that in the junction, itself.    It just -- the injunction was very spare.              If one could go agree -- let's say one could agree that was overbroad.                     Does that mean that the whole injunction falls?                     Let's say, take two pieces out of it:       No information sharing; that's beyond the pale.   And you can't make an order that a foreign court shouldn't hear a case.                     Take those two out.              But how about the rest of it?              So we have a basic question:   Is there habeas jurisdiction; and, as I understand the posture of this case, the Federal courts did not examine the merits of the habeas petition.                   They were just hung up on the bare jurisdictional question.
06-1717 +++$+++                  Mr. Wolfman, what about the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in EAJA?               Mr. Wolfman, if there's any discretion in the district judge in setting the amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer is $200?    Does it do the same thing with the paralegal? The true market rate is X, and we're going to knock it down so that it will match the knock-down for the lawyer?              But isn't it likely that when Congress said that, it was not thinking of paralegals.
06-179 +++$+++                And how does it -- how does it compare with another process that the FDA looks at very closely, I think even more closely than new devices -- new drugs.     New drugs also go through a very long testing period.       Is there -- and the FDA gives its approval, and the drug is marketed, and it turns out it has risks people didn't understand and there's a tort suit.   Is there -- is there a defense to the manufacturer, "I followed to the letter the permission that the FDA gave me"?                So it would certainly be at least the same here, right?               That compliance with the Federal law would be a defense on the merits.                Is there a reason -- as I understand it, tort suits are not preempted with respect to new drugs.    Is there a reason to treat the two differently?    For new medical devices and the new drugs?                So that's the difference. So the question -- what does the express preemption provision mean?                Take a --                Take a concrete situation where the FDA is asked:        We'd like to make this improvement.   And the FDA says no, we don't think that enhances safety.   And then there's a tort suit based on the failure to make that improvement.                   Wouldn't the FDA rejection of permission to make that improvement -- wouldn't that at least be preemptive?               I thought your response was it wouldn't go to the jury if the FDA had said no, you cannot make this, and the plaintiff's point is you must make it in order to make this device safe. I thought your answer to me was that the FDA regulation -- the FDA's action in refusing to allow the change to be made would be preemptive and you wouldn't give it to a jury to second-guess that determination by the FDA.               I was asking you, if it was -- as a matter of Federal law, if the FDA says -- rejects.               -- a proposed change, can a State court say, well, we think the FDA was wrong in rejecting that, so we're going to let it go to the jury. I thought the question I was posing to you is, isn't Federal law preemptive in that situation, when the FDA says you can't do it and the personal injury lawyer wants it to convince the jury that they had to do it?              How about the --              Another variation -- the FDA says you must include X in this device or we won't give you the pre-market approval.                And so the manufacturer puts X in, and then there's a lawsuit that wants to charge that putting X in made the device dangerous. Would the FDA's insistence that X be put in take X out of any State court's tort litigation?              That is, wouldn't -- if the FDA says you must have it, a State court couldn't put to a jury whether you should have eliminated it?               What about the label -- that you're pressing?       So you said you really don't know what the design defect was.             How about the label?    That would be the other thing.
06-219 +++$+++               General Garre, there's a record here that the district court said there was substantial evidence, enough to go to trial, of a pattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on this man's lodge and leaving the place in disarray, videotaping the guests, selective enforcement of the grazing laws, a whole pattern of things, even asking the Bureau of Indian Affairs to impound his cattle?              This man says, this has been done to me by officers of my government.    Is there a remedy?              Well, what is, what is there that will really be effective, because if you tell me challenging each citation for violating the grazing permit --               And then the behavior will continue and he'll get one more and one more and one more.                  Well that's exactly what he alleged and he said, and it happened for over a five-year period.                  I thought there was one aspect of the videotaping his guests, that the Government was doing it on its own land, on public land. They had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they weren't trespassing, they were just making the guests feel uncomfortable.              I would really like to have your answer to my opening question, and I said:                 If your only answer is each time something, he is charged by the BLM people, he goes one at a time, engaging a lawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the briefs called it, dying a thousand deaths.              He doesn't want that.   He wants to say:           Stop, stop this whole pattern; not one citation; stop this whole pattern.              How does he get that remedy?              What does, what does he have?                Who made that, who made that determination, including the selective citations?                I thought the Department of Interior reached a settlement agreement in which they told the line people at BLM to stop.               Nonetheless, they did enter a settlement which included that this behavior was going to stop.               Would you agree at least to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this proceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the district court said on summary judgment, there was sufficient evidence to go to a trial.                   That that's true. So we have to accept his allegations that there were selective citations for violations of grazing -- grazing laws, that they broke into his lodge and messed the place up?               Okay.         So that's --               So that's the case we have.   And you're telling me that the only remedy a citizen, assuming the truth of those allegations, is to fight these actions one by one?              Can he get injunctive relief?   Can he get injunctive relief?                  You said something about, that, you said they may seek to enjoin conduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated taking. Can he have this litany of things that have happened and go into a court and say court, enjoin those --              He can bring, he can bring this, he could bring this not one action at a time, but he could complain all at once about everything?               He could -- he could not go into a Federal court with a Federal question?              He would have to go to the initial decision maker, then the I --              But that's what his predecessor had.               That's a given in the record.    The record is that he was not on notice.             So whether one says, gee that's unlikely if he wasn't --               And it's trying to cover for its own sloppiness or carelessness in not recording --               But the Federal Tort Claims Act is against the United States.                It's not against the --                But then it wouldn't be a Federal Tort Claims Act.              I thought there was something about Nelson having assigned his, the right-of-way that he had to the Government.              Yes.          But it wasn't that it was a new assignment; it was the former owner assigned it and the BLA -- BLM approved.               The prior owner did assign it.    The stopper was the BLM.
06-278 +++$+++                So if the sign had been "Bong Stinks for Jesus," that would be, and Morse had the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be a protected right under Tinker because the message was not promoting drugs?                 But it may have made a difference in Tinker.       If the school had a policy, defend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought this into the category that you are now carving out? You said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the school did have a policy, patriotism, we support our troops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam.                 Should Tinker have come out the other way?                 Suppose it were Saturday instead of a weekday.                 Suppose it were Saturday, not a school day.     And the school children were not required to show up at the Olympic event but were encouraged to and the same thing happened.               Would it make a difference that it wasn't in the course of a regular school day?              But those were the words and characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could look at these words and say it's just nonsense.                      Or one could say it's like mares-eat-oats.                      It isn't clear that this is "smoke pot."              And at -- at this very rally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay to work for change in existing law which such a sign would be, but it is not okay to violate the law.                And no one was smoking pot in that crowd.                 But it wasn't, it wasn't like an assembly, was it?            As I understand it, the children were released from school, but they were not required to attend this event and they were not required to stand in front of the school on the opposite side. They weren't monitored by their teachers, so they -- and there were nonstudents in the crowd.                      So it's not like a school assembly.
06-313 +++$+++                 It's not just in isolation.     Didn't this prosecutor constantly say this case is not about Weaver, this case is larger than Weaver.    I think several times in the closing the jurors were told:     Think big, think the large picture, don't think about this individual.               But you just -- that's a bit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is distinguishable because there were no objections at all and that was the reason for the court saying this goes too far to the prosecutor.           But now you say when there are objections --               Certain statements. There are were many objections made here that were overruled.               To that extent the two cases were the same because in Newlon there were no objections either.               Do you think --               There were two cases cited as involving the same prosecutor?                   Was it Shurn also?               And that there was a significant overlap in the three charges in the three cases.   The prosecutor had been told in two of them, you went too far.   In this one, just in terms of what the prosecutor said in the closing argument, is this less offensive or would you say they're all on a par?               That was a slip on the District Court's part, wasn't it?                 I mean, that original petition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert petition to this Court should not have been dismissed, it should have been held, in which case the petition would have been timely and would not have been trumped by an AEDPA variant.
06-340 +++$+++                Isn't there a difference between denying the application because the Endangered Species Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and saying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get your application.    But then, so it's not just automatic that the thing becomes the State's domain rather than the Federal.    But isn't there something rather detailed called a memorandum of agreement that's worked out, and couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be accommodated that way instead of saying one statute is out the window, even though EPA in a number of states has made an accommodation. Why couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be reflected in that memorandum of agreement?                Are you referring to, in what you just described about the cooperation among the Federal agencies, to what has been called in their brief, it's referred to as a coordination agreement?               And that agreement, I take it from what you just said, is in full force?                EPA hasn't retreated from that agreement and it will continue to --               You mentioned a whole string of states, I think, Texas, Florida, Maine were mentioned as states that -- in connection with the transfer of the permitting authority had conditions that made the Endangered Species Act applicable.               So what was done in Texas, Florida and Maine?              So that, would that apply in this case?   Would that apply to Arizona?
06-376 +++$+++                 That's a -- on that point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax court to be restricted in the people who could claim the abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax court on your theory, if there is authority in the claims court and in the district courts, they're not limited to the net worth restrictions.                 Can I go back to something you just said, that I thought you said that the people would have no remedy if the tax court -- were the only forum for abatement claims?                     And it would be the exclusive forum but nobody -- it wouldn't deny access to anyone.                 Abatement claim, if you read this as the Government does, is one place where you go, and the tax court but everyone who has an abatement claim could go there.       So who's being cut out?              Oh, yes.      But -- yes. And I had asked you before well doesn't it seem, it seems strange that Congress would want to limit the authority of the, of the court where most people go and have no limit for the wealthier taxpayers.               I thought Congress was operating on the assumption that no court could hear an abatement claim?               Well, give me a decision of the claims court or a district court that said courts have authority to abate the interest before Congress enacted this legislation?               And it didn't exist before this statute?      I mean, the lower courts as I understand it said, routinely, yes, you can have jurisdiction, but have you no claim for relief because there is no, no law to apply.             This is a totally discretionary matter of the Commissioner's grace.                 So Congress perhaps didn't grasp the subtle distinction between no jurisdiction, and you can walk in the door but you go out the next door, because there is no justiciable claim.      And it provided peculiarly in the tax court for relief that was not available anyplace before?                The Fifth Circuit -- I thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.                I thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.              But the point that Mr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on interest abatement, and it involves mishandling within the Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other questions that have to do with the -- with the intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code --
06-413 +++$+++                But one piece of evidence that -- one piece of information that wasn't given apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about it, was that life meant life without parole.                   Because when he was questioned, he was surprised, he didn't know that that was the law.               He gave that as an example.     He didn't say and that's the only circumstance in which I be willing to vote for the death penalty.               He was asked to give an example.     He didn't say for example.                   But he didn't say this would be the only situation in which I would vote for the death penalty.               Is it a finding?       It's listed under "Summary and conclusions."                 Under "Findings," I thought under "Findings" the -- the findings were that he misunderstood the standard.                  He said beyond a shadow of a doubt, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.    And what other finding of fact was there?   Because this one is listed under conclusions. "From the facts, I conclude that he would be impaired." But the impairment is the conclusion from what facts?                But even at this point, this juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating circumstances.   He doesn't know about mitigating circumstances.   He hasn't been told what the standards of -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt. And to say that he should be criticized because when he was asked to give an example he said one thing and not another, it seems if you just read the transcript, that there's nothing disqualifying.             So as you said, everything is the weight falls on the demeanor, which an appellate court can't review.
06-427 +++$+++                  May I ask you a preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney? And that is, we are told that at the time this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and it was all right for one school to invite students from another school to join the invitee school's practice. And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its own students and not -- others are not invited.                But if it was permissible under the association's rules to invite students from other schools, then why is it impermissible to talk it up?             I mean, you can do it, but you can't talk about it?                But then that's part of the trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of the year.
06-43 +++$+++        And was the price four to five times higher than the normal rates for advertising?      Who told -- who told Charter that it was necessary for them to have a time spread between the contract -- the $20 above the contract price and the advertising payment?      Well, if it told them that, didn't it have -- it sounds to me from that that the accountant says, look, if you want to make this appear on the balance sheet as though the advertising revenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you better separate these two.    That suggests that Arthur Andersen knew all along what was going on.         Mr. Grossman, before you finish, there is one statement made by the other side that you are trying to use this -- small in comparison to all the fraud that was involved here in order to collect on the entire loss.      That is, you are asserting that the vendors are liable for the entire loss when they were just a bit player.        So what are you seeking? How would you measure your damages?
06-457 +++$+++                Mr. Stern, at the time that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect, were there any products where Maine told the retailer, if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services?             Was there any -- is tobacco alone or were there other commodities?              Does the Postal Service adhere to -- or I don't know if the Postal Service is used to ship cigarettes, tobacco products.              But if it is, does the Postal Service adhere to Maine's requirement?                 But it does -- you say the Postal Service provides something that conforms, that they have the -- you must deliver it to the person, to the addressee herself?               I thought that wasn't clear from their brief.          I thought they had a footnote that said they weren't arguing the point in this case, but I thought they didn't concede the total ban.                But isn't that the result of a settlement?                And nationwide, not just in New York; isn't that so?                So, then, practically, you don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New York settlement takes care of it.                You're just talking about other tobacco products?                But I thought, as a result of the New York settlement, carriers are no longer shipping directly to consumers anyplace cigarettes.                Mr. Stern, you told me in -- in response to my question earlier, you mentioned only, I think, game; and you said that those prohibitions were directly on the carrier --   -- that is, prohibitions and instructions for how you can ship game.              And I don't know if that -- if there are other food products.              You mentioned only that one. And is it not the case that explosives -- that that's Federal regulation?                 But is there -- in addition to the Federal regulation, which I take it would cover various dangerous substances, does Maine add to what the Federal regulation is, say, for sending fireworks, firearms?
06-480 +++$+++               There was an argument made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context, that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made with the dealers was more successful in getting a horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers had attempted it themselves, in which case some might have held back.               But it was not so long ago that the Department of Justice took a different view.   And of all of the vertical restraints, this is the only one where Congress has been a player.                  I mean, Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate.                  And then it withdrew that.       There's no other restraint where they are has been congressional action, where the argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if they so will.               But in those cases you didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and MCGuire.    That's what makes this -- this one different in terms of congressional intention.                Mr. Olson, before you sit down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to discount.   And if that were true, as a matter of fact, then that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust law, wouldn't it?              -- in the complaint,.                If the rule of reason is the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly, from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never get to trial.    How do you think the rule of reason would operate if it were the rubric under which this case were to be decided?                Well, that's the formula, but I take it from what you said and Mr. Olson said that the plaintiff could never get across the first threshold?              But in this case, this case has none of those features.              Leegin loses under the rule of reason, right?
06-484 +++$+++               Mr. Phillips, the Seventh Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line it's has the plaintiff proved a claim.                   But you're stating two different claims.              The claim that must be stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be proved, and I don't know of any other instance where that is so.               I wasn't asking it as a matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do you construe these words, what is it, "strong inference?"     And the words come out of, as I understand it, a Second Circuit decision.                So I would think the most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied. But your definition of strong inference is quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.              Is it fair to say at the pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it would only be more probable than not?              So you do --               -- there was a pleading stage, I would like your clear view on how much that changes.    It has been the understanding that when there is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the complaint and you construe the allegations in that complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Is that rule not applied under the interpretation you are giving us of strong inference?               You said the Court of Appeals to apply it.       Could the Court of Appeals applying the standard that you say is correct come to the same decision that it came to using a different verbal formula.                 But then you're doing away with reading the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.                But Mr. Phillips, you don't look at these things one at a time.                   You look at them altogether.                Is the statute all you had?                It says you must plead the facts with particularity.              But when one judges the adequacy of the complaint, one looks at all the facts pleaded with particularity, not just one.              Well, I think that this case was a good example.         There were two defendants and the court of appeals --              Well, to take the two that were at issue in this opinion.                     The court of appeals said the CEO, yeah, there's enough there to get over that threshold.      The other guy, no, there wasn't. So it's not that she's saying what you find for one, you find for all.          She is going at it defendant by defendant.               What do you do with a report that you know exists because you had one of these 26 confidential people tell you?                 But you haven't seen the report, so you don't have the date on it?                 And you won't know that date unless you have access to discovery.     Do you have to assume the date is later rather than sooner?               But you -- if the plaintiff --                  The plaintiff can't know for sure without seeing the document with a date on it.                  Congress -- Congress used words, "strong inference."            Those words are not self-defining.   One can think of several ways, in fact the courts of appeals did think of several ways.                  Why should we pick your way as opposed to the other ways one might define them?
06-5247 +++$+++                I thought the State court didn't find that there was error.               I thought the State court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it in.               It wasn't until we got into the Federal court that there was an error found. As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman or not, because there was no error.               Is that a question on which we would be likely to grant cert?                Are you talking about what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix? That was the only place that I found where the magistrate expressed a view on this.                    It reads:   "The court does not find that there has been" -- "the court does find that there has been an insufficient showing. So that "insufficient showing" means showing by the Petitioner."   Is that what you're relying on?               And that would put 2254 out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on post-conviction relief?                But there were all kinds of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony, including the time, the timing of the murder.
06-5306 +++$+++                  But wouldn't a reasonable lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I made this motion for extension of time.                   The rule said 14 days; this judge obviously made a slip.                   He miscalculated. Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order, say the judge probably made a mistake?                   So I better, if I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?               That means that a rule -- that -- 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion of the district judge.       If the district judge feels like giving a little more, this would be no control, unless the opposing side objects; is that right?               But the respondent said he had no reason at that time to believe that you wouldn't follow the rule and file within the 14 days. So if they made an objection, the moment the judge put down a date that's 17 days later, the judge might say that's premature.                This is, this is all at the top of page 151 of the joint appendix, right? That's the that entire thing.                Yes.          It was handwritten --
06-531 +++$+++                But do we have to judge all preliminary and judgments alike?                      I mean, in some cases, the preliminary injunction is the thing.                      For example, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had said yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge but we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration, and we got it; so we're -- that's enough.                      We're not going to fight on.               But why should a plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be -- this is a one-time only demonstration.                    We're not going to repeat this. Why force litigation, especially when we can say in this case, you lost on the merits?                    The judge made a prediction.      Turned out that -- that that was wrong.                So you get a case that involves a student.       And -- and something like the DeFunis case.     The student is admitted to the law school event.    They have much controversy over this affirmative action program.     The student graduates.                And -- but the student has prevailed up until that time.               But can't fight on because first, the student had gotten everything that he wanted and the case is moot.             The student has graduated.               On if you had a class action.    He had a single action, and he's graduated.               Apart from the class action, what -- what else is there?               Oh.      Yeah.              Ms. Seitz, would you clarify that point about costs?              Did your client have to pay costs?
06-5618 +++$+++               What would be your test of reasonableness for appellate review?              Could you describe it again?   Because I'm not clear what your answer was to what the appellate court stance is.                     I take it the appellate court would owe deference to the district court's determination?              And no particular deference to the guidelines?              So what is it other than -- is this arbitrary and capricious?              But the -- one problem is that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the facts in this very case differently.                      That is, one as in this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence him to more than 15 months would throw away his life. Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had been out on that same street every night for two and a half weeks.    So the quantity is much larger.                    And he was in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less. Those could be reasonable determinations, two different reactions that judges would have to the same set of facts.              Mr. Dwyer, before we get to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district court -- different district judges could act reasonably, one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the other giving 15 months, both of those would be reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal. But one of, one of the arguments that was made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack and the penalty for powdered cocaine. Your predecessor thought that was so wrong, he thought it was unconstitutional.                     I think at the very least you ought to take into account that if this man were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the guideline sentence range would have been six months to a year.   Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that disparity.   Is a district judge free to say under advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though he possessed powdered cocaine?                 Well, specifically, can you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him as though he possessed powdered cocaine?                   Can he do that?   Yes or no?                 Even though we know that Congress didn't want that to happen?
06-562 +++$+++               Mr. Hungar, was this Court wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the case in Key Tronic when it said, "Section 107 unquestionably provides a cause of action for private parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs?"              So you think that when the Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs would be included among private parties?               How does it work with "or a State" because I thought that there was some suggestion that States, they don't want to bother with the Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay under the State legislation.            You can't force a State to -- to take on that responsibility.              The States, we have a brief from the States telling us look, we don't want to put our money on that kind of thing.                    We've got very high-risk sites and we want to spend our resources making sure those are cleaned up.              Well, they -- they can. Of course they can but the States are telling us that this puts a burden on them that they don't want.               Well, let's just go back to Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a major point of the Eighth Circuit.                That is, they said the United States, the United States is a big polluter, could avoid its own responsibility by not bringing any enforcement action and by not settling, and you -- you said there would be a disincentive for the PRP -- a disincentive to settlement, but you didn't answer the question of why wouldn't the United States when it is a polluter and it would be responsible on this site, to say well, we are going to, we are not going to settle?                Then why this case -- there's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and also in the States' brief on page 24, and that is that the EPA was engaged in settlement negotiations with Atlantic Research, and then after this Court decided Cooper Industries that negotiation terminated.                The person who settled, wouldn't that person be protected?                 Wouldn't the court say, this person has made a bargain with the EPA and we're not going to extract any more from them?                Yes, but to make the statute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it seems to me that would be an altogether reasonable position for a court to take.             If someone has settled and is protected by virtue of that settlement, then when someone else tries to go after that same person the court could say:    We have to make the statute work and we're going to honor the settlement.
06-571 +++$+++               Would you address first whether receipt of the gun constitutes possession of the gun?              But under the statute as amended, possession is also indictable.                In Smith, the Court said that the reason that selling the gun in exchange for drugs -- what was dangerous about that was the potential for instantly converting the gun from currency to a cannon.    But here isn't that even all the more of concern because one who receives the gun can instantly turn it around and shoot the drug seller?               But it's the same on both sides.    It seems to me in both cases there is a risk of using the gun.    The one who comes in with the gun can use it; the one who receives the gun can use it.                  Mr. Koch, but the government answers that, a dollar for coffee, by saying it depends what question you ask.                  So if you ask was the coffee part of a beverage transaction, the answer would be of course yes.                  This is a gun transaction.               I don't remember whether you ask in your brief as an alternative argument for the overruling of Smith.               It has to be used by somebody, some human, and the human in this case is Mr. Watson.              And in answer to my question, you said you were not urging the overruling of Smith?               If he has a gun in his hand he is certainly carrying it.
06-5754 +++$+++                 How can you say that, given that at the sentencing hearing, that military record was brought out, his physical ailments were brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that was brought out?   And indeed, the judge was assisting the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it was presented.               So your position would be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed would have to -- that the trial judge would also have to go through -- now this defendant maintained his innocence.   He didn't express any remorse.             He accused a Government agent of perjury.            All that, he would have to take into account, just as specifically?              Isn't that what the Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?               How about the point that Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been taken into account by the sentencing commission because Congress told them to consider those same factors?                The, the judge also pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant protested his independence, and the jury had found him guilty of false statements.                The judge was bound by those.
06-593 +++$+++                  I thought the words were home of the person who employs, not who receives the services but who employs.                 By -- reading out the words "of the person who employs" her?              I thought that the Department of Labor's first take on this was that the exemption did not apply to third-party employers.                That was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't it?              I'm referring to the notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great stock.   I thought the original notice and comment rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to third-party employers.                  And -- and there was no further discussion of it after -- after it sent out the notice of proposed ruling that said third party employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?                  Some would be the ones that qualified as -- what is the phrase, enterprises engaged in commerce?               Were they covered before, before there was any provision that dealt with household workers?    If state and localities were considered enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they were -- they had no exemption before, their companion care people, just as household workers, would be covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.                The statute treats together babysitters and elder care people, but I take it the babysitters if they were working for an agency rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any exemption?   Is that right?               Isn't it odd that this -- the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were not covered before.     So it added household workers.        And yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on adding people, it also subtracted people who were covered before, took them out, removed them from the coverage of the Act.
06-618 +++$+++               Do you think -- do you think that we owe any special measure of respect to the Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is, this legislation is compatible with that clause?              But what we are involved with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the laws that govern all other employers.               That's part of -- how many second selves would there be? (Laughter.)               On the Senator's staff?               How many second selves? Of -- what universe are you covering?                    Who is not a second self, who works in a Senator's office?
06-6330 +++$+++               Mr. Nachmanoff, in the absence of anything further from Congress, and accepting your argument that there's no -- that the Guidelines did not have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the mandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I see that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs are a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for powder as high as for crack?              But if we throw out the 100 to 1, what is the range open to the district judge -- hundred to one is okay, but I have to use the -- I'm going to use the crack for both?                 Or say there is a difference between the two, so I'm going to set it at 20 to 1 and another judge 5 to 1. What is -- are all those reasonable within the position that you take in this case?                 Would all those have to pass muster at the court of appeals level?                  And Mr. Nachmanoff, I think that you are agreeing, although you don't want to come right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point; that is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to one is open to the district judge; and within that range, there is no abuse of discretion.               In any case, your answer is anything from what Congress has said, down to one to one, would be a reasonable sentence that would be -- that would pass muster on appeal because it is not an abuse of discretion.               But you've given me a bunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy for a district judge to say:            Here's my laundry list; and I'm going to go through every one of them; but in the end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's what I'm going to impose.              So -- Congress not having done that, then the range is open to the district judges, 100 to 1 to 1 to 1.
06-637 +++$+++               So that enabled the parent to remove the child immediately and risk that --              -- the public education would be found inadequate.              But all that section does is to repeat the Burlington scenario.                    It says, it codifies what the Court held.              The Court didn't say anything in Burlington about the situation where the child was never in public education.              Are there not children -- I think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism Society that says many school systems simply do not have the facilities to attend to the needs of these children?              Are there not cases where school districts have said from day one, look, we don't have facilities to handle this type of disability?               But isn't it true that the parent will never be reimbursed?                   Let's take the parent that Justice Scalia has hypothesized, will never get one penny of that tuition unless that parent carries the burden -- the parent would have the burden of showing that there was no appropriate public education?               That's not the question I asked.                I said that the parent -- let's assume that the parent never sends the child to public school, nonetheless seeks reimbursement.              In order to get reimbursement that parent would have to show, would have bear the burden of showing that there is no appropriate public education available; is that not true?                Then the conclusion would be that that parent hasn't met the heavy burden of showing that there is no appropriate public education.               What is the basis for saying that, when the one thing that the statute is very clear on is that the starting premise of any reimbursement claim is that an appropriate public education is not available?            That wouldn't concentrate, testing that wouldn't concentrate on what the private school is doing but what the public school could do.               But you don't have the burden; the parents do.                 I thought this statute was also premised on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, in which case it wouldn't have spending clause notice argument.
06-6407 +++$+++                 If you bring it earlier, it will be unripe.      But it did, I think, leave open the precise procedural posture that we're in now.                       It didn't resolve that.                One problem with a mental illness that is a peculiar feature of this case, in other cases something different is introduced late.                    It wasn't ripe.    It wasn't there before.                  But here you have an individual who has a severe mental impairment.                    He had it before he committed these murders.                    He's had it when he was -- when there was the original competency to see if he could stand trial. He had it all along.               It may have manifested itself with different delusions at different times.                And yet at every stage he says he's incompetent to stand trial.    They hold he is competent to stand trial.              Then he says, well, I'm competent, so I want to represent myself.   The judge says, yeah, you're able to represent yourself, you're competent. Every -- this is not anything new that has happened to him.   He has been in this delusional state all along.   And now to say at this point it counts, but at other points it didn't?
06-666 +++$+++                  Mr. Trower, were private activity bonds considered at all below?                   As far as I understand, this is not a private activity bond, it's not, what's at issue here.             And there was no adjudication with respect to that type of bond --                 -- in the lower courts.
06-6911 +++$+++                So if you had a statute -- a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't take away any one's civil rights, not even a first degree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would be equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away and then restored.               They're not anomalies because the gun prohibition would cover them, even though they never had their civil rights taken away?                 Is that -- is that what you're saying?               Well, then, maybe the problem was that Congress included misdemeanants who were subject to over a two- year sentence. The point has been made that, on your reading, that was a futile gesture, or Congress did one thing that was cancelled out by someone else, by another provision.   And then they put in this group of misdemeanants who were subject to an over-two-year sentence; but most of that group -- and in many states all of them -- would not have their civil rights taken away. So what is left of the group that was put in, misdemeanants with over-two-year sentences?               What was the point of putting that group in the statute as covered by the Career Criminal Act?               But how many would be -- take a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun rights from misdemeanants. What effect in that State would this legislation have --     what effect would the provision of this legislation -- that says misdemeanants who are subject to a two-year -- over-two-year term are covered? It wouldn't be covered because the -- because they're not having their civil rights taken away.
06-694 +++$+++               But Ferber confined the meaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater extent than this statute does.               It talks about artistic value, but this -- there were several examples given in the briefs.    One was this film depicts 12 year old child having sexual relations with an old man.                  Now that statement could be perceived as this film shows child pornography. Just that statement.               But it's a truthful statement about Lolita, is it not?               Why not?      If you say -- if you say, 12 year old child -- this film shows a 12 year old child, and it doesn't tell you that the person who's playing a 12 year old is a young adult?                But --                I just wanted to clarify the footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote 4 in your reply brief.       It says, to the contrary, the government's brief expressly acknowledges that the statute's proscription encompasses noncommercial speech. So I think Justice Breyer's suggestion that you said in your brief, that the statute is limited to commercial speech, is something that you -- say, no, that's not so; we say it encompasses noncommercial speech.               Even though -- even though what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does not fit the definition?        Even if what you're showing -- you say, have I got some hot child porn and here it is, and the "it" is -- is -- an adult pretending to be a child, or a virtual image. So the -- the problem is not an accurate representation that this is hardcore porn, and it is, but saying, have I got the real stuff, but what you present is not at all the real stuff.               You could -- just one question.     You mentioned a film, "Traffic," which I did not see, but one of the briefs said there was an actual 17 year old playing that part. But you said that wouldn't be -- that wouldn't fit.               But the statute says simulated.                How is it different it would be strange to trust out the document -- the doctrine as I -- as I understand it is what we relied on when we had the predecessor to this statute before.               How did that occur in -- free speech coalition.
06-713 +++$+++               You have two choices and I think there's another one on page 12, is there not? So are you representing, General MCKenna, that one of these will be what the State of Washington ballot will look like?               General MCKenna, may I ask you at that point --              -- if that's a correct statement of your position. I didn't understand you to take the position that a candidate has a constitutional right to state on the ballot.    The State of Washington has chosen to give the candidate that option, but is -- I have not read anything in your brief that suggests that a candidate has a right to do so.              But you did say that it is unlikely voters will be mistaken, that they will mistakenly consider a statement of party preference to be the equivalent of a party endorsement.                You did say that, and on what basis are you predicting that the statement of preference will not be confused with a statement of endorsement?
06-7517 +++$+++    is two questions; time question and the content question. What would she have had to say to comply with the rule as you read it?              That's a complex answer. And I -- this seems to me to be a clear case of what was in the judge's mind.        She said I have a record here of repeated e-mails to this woman, threatening to kill her, threatening to kill her new husband, threatening to kill her mother.     He did it again and again and again. I have seen this person, he appeared before It is my educated prediction that he will do it me. So I'm going to put him away for as long as I again. can. That's -- her reasoning process is not at all mysterious. What notice is the defendant lacking?              Why should we put into rule 32(h), as Justice Scalia suggests, the 3553(a) factors, when we know that the rule makers did make a change in 2007?    That is they put 3553(a) into 32(d)(2)(F); so they made a change there and they said the judge could ask to have these things included in the pre-sentence report; but they left (H) looking like it's dealing just with the guidelines.                  Why couldn't the Court say well, we didn't put 3553 in (h), and so it's not there?
06-766 +++$+++                That convention -- conventions can come in all sizes and shapes.                The argument here is that this system shuts out rank-and-file party members and gives the total control to the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the primary or selection of delegates, but it's really a sham because nobody is going to run for that except the party faithful, someone picked by the party boss. So the argument on the other side is that this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to the party leaders choose the candidates.              So the party is -- you're identifying the party with the party leader because the argument comes down to this is not the rank and file that's making this election; this is the party leader; and the party might like that or the leadership might like that, but the rank and file might not, and the argument is that they have rights of association, too.                In practice, how many people other than the slate selected by the party leaders run in New York for this delegate position?               But if the autonomy of the party and, let's say, the leader is the justification for this, the party -- how -- how autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you want to be more democratic about how you choose your candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this system on you?
06-7949 +++$+++                What about the Eighth Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the whistle, so the conspiracy continued.                   He could have stopped the conspiracy. And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe there's some kind of obligation to pay back. So could a court of appeals try to instruct district judges and say:         Now, in this factor, leaving a conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.               There is no indication that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to it.                How?                How can it fix the --               But you said -- you said before that, and very definitely, that Congress could fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at him.   You said yes, Congress could fix that.             Well, how other than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?               What in your view would be -- would fail the abuse of discretion test?             If we have a sentence of -- what was the guideline range?              And the judge gives no prison time, three years probation.                      What would it take to be -- describe what an abuse of discretion would be?

06-8273 +++$+++                  That issue is not a necessary part of your case at all, but you don't have to suggest that you could depart.                  You could do less than Teague.     For example, Griffith.                   You can accept that as a given because it doesn't touch your case. Isn't that so?              But there is -- there is -- it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply it from this day forward.          Crawford is retroactive at least for cases that are not yet final.                  When they were on trial, Crawford wasn't there, but maybe somewhere toward the end of the appellate process, lo and behold, they can take advantage of it. So it's a question of where you want to cut it off.   And at one time, didn't this Court cut it off in a different place?               I'm -- I'm confused on this one, because I thought it was part of our retroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply that new rule while the case is still in the pipeline, while it is on direct appeal, not that they -- well, they just may, but they absolutely must apply it retroactively.   I thought that's what Griffith said.                If it comes up after -- if the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of course, the decision has to apply.               But if you can say -- it is a little odd that the State executive can say, yes, as far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what was always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive enough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to raise Teague.   It would be an anomaly, would it not, that the executive of the State is not bound by Teague, but the courts are?               It's subject to the floor, that the floor that this Court sets, it must be retroactive to a certain extent.

It's a question how many will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation costs.               They haven't -- neither has been certified, has it?
06-856 +++$+++                Where does it say that (a)(1) is available only against the plan?              I thought your own argument was that (a)(3) is the catchall.                So if (a)(2), which is described as very precise, if that's applicable, you would not get to (a)(3).                You would be asking us at this point to assume that somehow the (a)(2) case folds, and then we flip over into (a)(3). But why should we get there prematurely?                  It seems to me if it's right that (a)(2) comes before (a)(3), it isn't -- it's not quite a ripeness issue, but it's close to that.               Mr. Roberts, would you clarify what the government's position is on this (a)(1)(B) argument?     Are you saying it is available, but (a)(2) is available?               Well, now we know what benefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when he made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he could have made an unwise investment the next time.                  And --
06-9130 +++$+++                Did you say IRS officers, because they would be covered?               It's tax and customs.               You gave an example in your brief that didn't seem to fit.                       I mean you spoke of a DEA agent who was searching for narcotics, and that sounds to me like what DEA agents do.                      They were not auxiliary to a customs officer.               But they were doing it for their primary business, which was to detect narcotics.                Does that still exist after the Westfall Act?               Because now, the -- there wouldn't be -- the United States would be substituted --               -- for the agent's abuses.               Wouldn't they have IFP status?               Here there wasn't that much at stake.
06-923 +++$+++               Let me follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief really goes astray on that.              Think of the many situations like the remainderman who is the trustee.                 He has to look out for the interests of the live tenant, but he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants to be economical.    That's not saying that he is.              So I've always understood that the term "conflicting interests" means just that; you have conflicting interests.   It doesn't mean that you necessarily slide And I think that if you would over into misconduct. keep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting Has the trustee in fact interest?   Yes, there is. slipped and taken unfair advantage because of the conflicting interests?              But then you come to the end of the line.    You have to prove that the authority was misused.    And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's decision, what those judges were doing, they say we're going to look at this with some skepticism because of the conflict.    And let me give you a concrete example. This woman got Social Security disability benefits and she did it at the suggestion of MetLife is; that so?              But she got a lawyer that they recommended that she have.              But the point is they came to her and said:        Get Social Security disability benefits.   Now, to get those she would have to show that she is totally and permanently disabled.              So here is a company that says:   Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and permanently disabled, but -- and then we'll recoup all that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not disabled.    Why isn't it appropriate to regard just that set of circumstances with suspicion?              Yes, I'm not questioning that at all.              That sounds fine.   It's a question of why, after helping her tell the government that she was totally disabled, they, after the initial two-year period, turned around and said she's not.              Well, let's take these facts.              As the trier -- I mean ERISA, yes, it certainly says you can be both the plan administrator and the payor, but all it says is that that's permissible.       But it also provides for review of those decisions, judicial review in court.                And here is, say, a district court is looking at it and says:                 I don't understand why the company didn't look at the doctor's explanation and put such heavy weight on a checkmark.   And I also don't understand the suggestion that she is totally disabled to the government and then saying, well, she's really not, in this very close time frame.   So it might be okay and it might not. I am in equipoise about this case, not the terms of the plan but the decision that was made to deny her benefits.   So which way do I call it?              That's the question that Justice Souter posed, and you seem not to want to face up to it and answer it.              How does that bear on making a determination that the --              -- employee -- that the plan administrator has to make:              Is this person disabled and is she not?              Where, where is this decision from that you're --              There's one feature of this that I don't understand.               It was referred to very swiftly in Judge Merritt's separate opinion.                      He said at one point there was a proposal by MetLife that they give this woman a trial run at a sedentary job to see if she could do it.    And he said that that made a lot of sense to him, and it was MetLife's proposal, but then it got withdrawn.    Could you clarify what that was?              Then why did MetLife withdraw that proposal?              My question was not what Dr. Patel said, but how did that proposal get dropped?
06-937 +++$+++                May I give you a specific example?   I think the Chief has something on this order in mind.   Could the patentee say to the licensee, to the Intel, that, I license you to sell only to buyers who have a license from the patentee?               Could -- could the licensee be limited in that way?               But explain to me -- perhaps I should ask Mr. Phillips this question -- but why isn't it done that way?            The way -- if the patentee wants to maintain control further down the line, why doesn't the patentee just limit the licensee to selling to people who are licensed?               Mr. Hungar, is there a reason why Congress codified this doctrine in the Copyright Act, but not in the Patent Act?               And the PTO didn't take any position on whether it should be codified?
06-939 +++$+++               Then why did Congress in several statutes have a provision from which California copied when it enacted this measure?                     In several statutes, the Congress has said this Federal money will go to the grantee, if the grantee says it will not use any money that we give them to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.                But they run against that principle because they say at least under these programs -- I think there were more than three.                   Wasn't Medicare --                Those -- those grantees would be subject to the NLRA.              So, as to them, it is modified.                I thought you -- you are bringing a facial challenge, and I thought that you must show, not that the State must show, and the State -- the simple argument is look we are paying for certain things, and we want to get what we paid for.                There are a lot of other things that we could have paid for, but we -- we want to get, say, a training program for elementary schoolteachers.          And that has nothing to do with union organizing.        We don't want to pay for union organizing.              Where did the lower court say it has nothing to do with the State getting what it is paying for and not paying for things it doesn't want to pay for?              That in --               So it would come out -- it would come out differently if the statute has said, we want to get what we pay for and we don't -- we choose not to pay for labor relations?                Did they say something different from what Congress said in those three or four statutes that were mentioned earlier?               What policy was Congress implementing in the Federal funding statute that California copied?               But they do say that the money is not to be spent to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.               And why do they do that?               But you don't -- there's no reason, rhyme or reason to what they would have done in these three statutes that you say is flatly contrary to national labor relations policy?

The relevance of this same group having a poll strongly opposed Feingold every time he ran for election.           It's no secret that they were opposed to his candidacy.
06-984 +++$+++                Does the ICJ ever issue a judgment of that character?             It issues a judgment between two nations, two or more nations, and it is instructs the United States to do something.                 I'm not aware of any -- any decision of the ICJ that says what a sentence should be for a particular individual.              If you had a --              If you had a treaty on the recognition and enforcement of judgments, mutual recognition and enforcement, then we would enforce the judgment that we agreed to enforce by treaty.                We wouldn't look behind it to see if we agreed with it on the merits. Are you saying that this undertaking, this agreement to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ gives the judgment in the particular case, although not precedential effect, the counterpart to full faith and credit?               Then it becomes --               Then it becomes a penal judgment, and I thought the rule was that no country forces -- enforces another country's penal judgment.               But if we say --               -- this man goes to jail for 5 years, it seems to me that's a penal judgment.                You didn't mention the --                You didn't mention the Optional Protocol which is -- is where the United States gave its promise.     It voluntarily accepted this jurisdiction.   It didn't have to.              But that would take an action by somebody in the country.              Here that hasn't -- that hasn't happened.   94 would never be triggered because we haven't said we're breaking our promise, we're not going to comply.               If you don't -- if you don't comply, you don't comply.              But we -- certainly not -- in that situation here, the President said the United States agreed that it would submit to the binding jurisdiction for one case only, and we are bound by that judgment and I'm going to enforce it.              General, can we just clarify something which I think is important?                  Justice Scalia suggested that this wasn't self-executing.                  The State Department with respect to the Vienna Convention itself told Congress very clearly:                  You don't have to do anything; this is self-executing.                 And then the protocol says:   We the United States agree to accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ in a certain class of cases. And Congress ratified that, too.                So I don't think that self-executing has anything to do with this case.               But in Nicaragua the United States took the position from day 1 that the ICJ had no jurisdiction over the case.                 So the absence of jurisdiction is always an exception to the obligation, even within the United States, to give full faith and credit.   If the court had no jurisdiction, another State doesn't have to give full faith and credit.                 But if it does have jurisdiction, then the obligation kicks in.
06-989 +++$+++                Mr. Phillips, would you say the same thing if the agreement provided for de novo review in the district court?               That would be -- I am assuming that the parties wrote that standard into their contract, so to the extent you're relying on party autonomy why couldn't the parties elect whatever standard of review they wish?               But they were both -- they were both in this agreement, both the substantial evidence rule and the standard of review of legal error. So are you saying that you -- we don't have to deal with that question or you're not going to defend it, because the standard was dual.        Am I not right about what they --               It doesn't read like one. 10 and 11 don't read like default --               What else is there besides the manifest whatever?             The --
07-1015 +++$+++                  General Garre, will you clarify one point?      You said "fails to state" enough to overcome qualified immunity.              But, usually, these -- the pleading is analyzed discretely.                 This is a 12(b)(6) motion, is it?                 And so that tests just the pleading.    Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense which hasn't even been stated formally.                So isn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good complaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but when the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the plaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off a summary judgment motion?                General Garre, I think that the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that Justice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this, but most of it is about what it takes -- what are the essential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge.              And there's a big mistake that the pleaders are making; that is, there has to be an agreement, and they haven't alleged an agreement. This case seems to be quite different.              And I think you have taken Bell Atlantic, frankly, for more than is there.   That is, twice -- at least twice in the opinion, the Court says, we are not developing any heightened pleading rules.           Form 11 is as good today as it was yesterday.    What we are talking about is a missing -- is an essential element to a substantive claim for relief.     I thought that's what --               How about --               How about Rule 11 to take care of Justice Breyer's problem?                 The judge would say to the lawyer:   Now, you signed this pleading, and when you made -- you signed it, you made certain representations, and I'm going to read the Riot Act to you if it turns out that this is a frivolous petition.              I was responding to Justice Breyer's Coca-Cola president.                  I think Rule 11 would work quite well to answer that.              General Garre, there was a reference, I think, in Judge Gleason's decision in the Eastern District to the Office of the Inspector General report on the detainees' treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center.     Is there nothing in those reports that lends some plausibility to Iqbal's claims?              Is there other litigation, General Garre, pending with respect to the detentions?              Is there -- is there a Tort Claims Act action pending or -- I don't know where I got that impression -- arising out of these detentions?                But it -- it did happen? At least it did --
07-10374 +++$+++               That's not how it moves through the courts.      That is, you don't have a forum. That sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling.                 Those cases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where the parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts don't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in Timbuktu, those sound like, we don't offer a forum for that type of case, as distinguished from here, where New York does have a forum, it just won't kind of give one kind of relief.               What Justice Kennedy has asked you:    Say, you could have this Federal claim, but we are going to offer you a substitute under New York law, which the Federal authority could not force us to do, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity.               Now, why can't New York take the position, we want to be realistic about these suits?    New York has provided that it is going to -- it's going to pick up the tab.                If you sue a correctional officer, New York is going to pick up the tab. So -- so we are going to channel this suit to the court, the one court in the State that deals with the State, the sovereign, paying money, the court of claims.   So all they are doing is recognizing the reality that this is a suit against New York, not the correctional officer because it won't cost the correctional officer a dime; New York is going to provide counsel and is going to pay any judgment. So really where this case belongs is in the court that hears claims against the State of New York.                  Was there any substantive change from what the original enactment to the amendment -- the one that's currently enforced?
07-10441 +++$+++               Before we -- before we get to the statute, MCNabb-Mallory are exercises of this Court's supervisory authority over the lower courts?              And they were both pre-Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of his right to remain silent.              Whatever Congress put in 1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, MCNabb-Mallory are no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.              Do you need fundamental principles when you have got Rule 5 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure?      Don't they say that an arrestee shall be taken before a magistrate without unreasonable delay?               At least one time limit that has been complied with -- and that's the Fourth Amendment, how long you can keep somebody seized without taking them before a magistrate -- there is no violation of that time period, is there?
07-1059 +++$+++               Mr. Stewart, we're reviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit.              And the Federal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power case in which the same issue was presented, albeit under a different statute. But I -- reading that Florida Power, where the Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position, the Government's position then was that this very same transaction involved the rendition of services and not a sale of goods. Does the Government have a distinction between those two cases, or are you now saying in hindsight you realized that the position that you took before the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?
07-1090 +++$+++                  Mr. Franklin, even if you are right about that, the legislation was an emergency measure with a sunset.         It was revived for 1 year, but then no more.     So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back?                Didn't the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency law sunsetted?              Including -- including the provision that repealed 1605(a)(7).                  So that would be revived?                Do we have any other instance in which a jurisdictional provision is withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?              Were there judgments, outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on appeal?              And you're not claiming that those could be reopened?               I thought we were just told that because there -- of the limitations on enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.              Is -- is all of this -- I won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying, well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's no cause of action.               Where the wrong occurred would have been Iraq.                Wouldn't any such settlement have to take into account that Iraqi -- the Iraqi people themselves were the most numerous and probably the worst victims of the terror?              You said that there should be deference to what the executive did because of his role in foreign affairs.             But in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Congress deliberately withdrew what had been the executive's traditional authority and said:   President, no more; we are going to set rules of how sovereign immunity will operate.
07-1114 +++$+++                  But it was -- it was decided.   It was decided -- wasn't it decided the first time around?   I mean, the Chief Justice calls your attention to page 25a.         The reason the court said they're not Brady material -- we said it before, we said it the last time the case was before the court.                 52.               If it is --                  But your proposal would be that they would never do it because you want to send it back to the Federal district court, and it's -- and if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that didn't make sense. But now you're proposing that the State court will not be the one to look at these materials; instead it will be the Federal court.                     I think there was something that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that indicated he thought that the State court ought to be the one to do this close examination.                     Didn't -- didn't he propose a stay of the Brady claim in the Federal court pending exhaustion of that claim in the State court?               Where is that colloquy? I remember witnesses saying he looked weird, he looked wild-eyed.     Where was the answer that he looked --                 You recognize that a -- a defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs, that isn't ambivalent?        I mean, a jury, just like it might react adversely to the defendant if he says I was drunk on alcohol, that they might say this is a person who put himself in this condition where his will could be overpowered, this is a voluntary act, why should we consider it, why should we consider it mitigating, we -- we could just as well consider it aggravating?
07-11191 +++$+++            Mr. Friedman, one of the problems that has been brought up is that this is an inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the analyst.   Do you recognize any economy -- for example, that the analyst could testify from the lab, have video conferencing, and so the analyst, while the prosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab instead of coming down to the courthouse?             But, in your view, it wouldn't satisfy the Confrontation Clause if, say, the supervisor shows up and said that this is -- this is the way the analysts operate and describes the procedures.            So is the proper solution to grant, vacate, and remand in light of Melendez-Diaz?
07-1122 +++$+++               Then you're doing away with the first Terry factor altogether.                  Do you think all you need is reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous?       What happened to the reasonable suspicion that a crime has just been committed or is in the course of being committed?              Then you are doing away with the first Terry factor.             There are two factors recognized:    One, reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime is afoot; and two, this person is reasonably suspected of being armed and dangerous.                  Your answer to Justice Souter suggests that you don't need the first one, you don't need to have any suspicion that a crime is afoot; it's enough that you reasonably suspect that the person is armed and dangerous.                  But Officer Trevizo herself testified that she thought the seizure part was over.   She asked him would he get out of the car, and then she said -- I think she used the word "consensual" herself, that it was a consensual encounter.                 That after the initial seizure was over, and then she wanted to question him about gang, his gang affiliations -- and didn't she testify?   I seem to remember she did, and she said it was voluntary.               When -- when did this end?    You just said -- you said when the car is stopped everyone is seized, the driver and the passengers as well.     The seizure ends at some point.                    Is that when the driver is ticketed and the police cruise off or --               Then how did the -- how did the officer come up with the marijuana as well as the gun?               But you say -- your brief goes much, much further.           And I'm looking at page 9 where you say:     "Police have to be able to protect the officer's safety from a person reasonably believed to be armed and dangerous whenever the officer encounters that person in a place where the officer has a lawful right to be." I read that to mean if the law -- the officer is on the street, in a pub, any place where he has a lawful right to be, that officer can, on the basis of a suspicion of armed and dangerous, pat down, and you don't need the first Terry.              It's only -- it's only the armed and dangerous.
07-1125 +++$+++                  Could you raise the podium?                 But we can hear you.              Mr. Rothfeld, I follow your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights area there are a lot of overlapping statutes.                     You can sue under Title VII.       It doesn't take away your right under 1981. But in this case, as we get down to what this case is about, we have a determination by a court that the school district acted reasonably in relation to these complaints.    And then you say:                   But we have constitutional claim.       A constitutional claim requires you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an individual; if you are talking about an institution, some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a pattern. What, when you get down to the merits, is different about those?        In other words, is it on the wrong track to talk about precluding a statute?                        Instead of talking about just plain old issue preclusion, what is different about 1983? Yes, you have two claims; but if you lose under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.               What more?      What more is alleged in the complaint?            I thought the complaint just spoke about deliberate indifference.              Spell that out -- spell that out practically.       I know you used --              But there was no allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.               I still don't follow. What disparate treatment?          Did you have to have that they treated girl's complaints one way and boy's complaints another way?              And as far as this record shows, there has just been this one incident of harassment.                But we find that out on remand.               What you're saying is they made a basic legal error.               You may have a losing case under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?               Well, because they were relying on case where we did say that a very detailed scheme was pre-emptive?               It did that because if you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism that Congress had set up, who would use it?               Just on that one issue on attorneys' fees.               Have there been any decisions on Title VI and 1983?               And those constitutional rights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 case, given that, as to the individual, you have qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have to show a custom or practice.                It would be a different claim, but there would be issue preclusion.              And the official -- it's the plaintiff who would be precluded.              And the plaintiff has had a full and fair opportunity to argue those issues.
07-1209 +++$+++                  Can we go back to the question that was just posed?              We have never held that every agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes, but in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on the petitioner.    But this Court has never held that across the board, no matter what agency we are talking about, that's the rule.                But if the government has the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to say to the court, "this is what, if we had done what we were supposed to do, this is what we would have included in our notice."    And looking at that, the court can tell whether there's anything the veteran might have done. But why shouldn't the government at least have the obligation to say what it would have done had it complied with the statute, what it would have said specifically in this case?               What is the experience? When the case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does it go back to the regional?              Suppose the -- the veteran is now given an opportunity to present whatever additional substantiation.
07-1216 +++$+++                Mr. Shapiro, we are dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line always reads "for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion."     And it was my understanding that a State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law ground, if there is such a ground in the case.               Didn't -- did the Court -- suppose the -- what is it called -- "correct in all respects" had been raised and decided by the Oregon Supreme Court in the first instance.                      Suppose it had said, well, we don't have to deal with whether Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular, because it was wrong in other respects.                      Suppose that had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme Court said.    Would that have offended any Federal due process?    Would that have been an appropriate disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?               How could we have determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself hadn't made any determination?               But we don't decide questions, particularly questions of State law, that may have a Federal check.       But we don't decide them in the first instance. And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I think affects this concern of fairness to the parties who raised this "correct in all respects" from the beginning.   This Court had not clarified, had it, until the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others. In State Farm we were talking about harm to nonresidents.    So if I recall correctly, Williams was the first time we ever clarified that harm to others included people within the same State; is that correct?               I thought the notion was one issue, one charge.         And it wasn't in just one practice manual.     There were a few cited in the brief that the charge should be limited to one issue, one point of law.               But I thought the whole thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were discussing?                -- that this was something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung at the last minute, that it was not like this rule. There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court applying the rule.      It seemed to be quite a novel rule.               She didn't get to the -- the other grounds, because I think it was all about that paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under our then precedent.       And I don't think that -- that the -- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now -- are now before us were -- were even reached then.                And where is this colloquy?    I mean, we went through the parts, she said I think it's covered and it was okay.                       You seem to be saying more than ws included in that colloquy.                You've made it much clearer than it was.               Which portion of the charge specifically are you referring to?               What about this point that was made that in 2002 that is exactly what Philip Morris did, give one simple, precise instruction?               Is it -- is it true that they gave one simple sentence stating their position on -- on what harm to others, how that --               But -- but was the instruction stated in a -- in a single paragraph, but all the other requests to charge were broken out?
07-1223 +++$+++               I didn't hear the -- the last part.               But the Virginia Supreme Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them.               They said specifically "all facts alleged in the petition will be taken as true."               They said they did.               I don't get the diligence part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's counsel that's been ineffective.               So, it doesn't translate into ineffective assistance of counsel because the client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not been diligent, but there is nothing that the client could do.     I just don't see how --               -- how you could talk about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.               But you use the -- to say that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be, right, but it's such an extraordinary use of "claim."                      I mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional evidence in support of the basic claim.                    The basic claim is ineffective assistance of counsel.                 I that what it was saying is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question. Strickland has two parts.           Part A is were counsel inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference? It seemed to me the district court was just making a straight out Strickland determination and not deferring to anything else.     It was just saying no, I've looked at all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they were not effective.      On the other hand, there is no prejudice because using the strict Strickland test, there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would have come out differently.                I think she said --                -- she answered -- the answer that I wrote is the same thing that you could have on the Brady claim you could also have for ineffective assistance of counsel.                  It's a wholly new matter.   I thought that's what she said.
07-1239 +++$+++                General Garre, when you address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as originally ordered by the district court or are you taking account of the modification made by the Ninth Circuit, and would you say that the three points you just made would apply as well to the injunction as modified?               You didn't mention the 564 exposures that were typed Level A in the environmental assessment.                 I thought the 564 number was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure resulting in severe harm.                 Rulemaking to do what? To set up an orderly regime for Federal agencies to carry out their obligations under NEPA?               But what good is it if, as I understand it, the whole training program will be over in December, and then the environmental impact statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to come after the whole project is concluded?               Near -- "near certainty."                 I thought that you were not suggesting --                 And you are not suggesting that -- that there is a probability of success on the claim that you had to file an environmental impact statement.               Yes.          I thought you conceded that point.
07-1309 +++$+++                Mr. Fernich --               -- are we talking just about the instruction to the jury?                I know you think that the instruction given here was incorrect.                But is it just a question of charge error or are you saying that there was insufficient evidence of enterprise for this case to go to the jury?               You're saying if a proper charge had been given, this jury on this evidence still could have convicted the defendant?               Did you make that -- did you make that objection in the trial court?                 What does "structure" mean?   I think you said it doesn't mean that this has to be an organization with a president, a treasurer; it doesn't mean that.                 What is -- what is the minimum to qualify as having a structure?                 The jury -- the words that you asked for, what was it?                "Ascertainable structural hierarchy."        And suppose the judge gets questions from the jury:          "Your Honor, what do you mean by ascertainable structural hierarchy?"                 Those are the words that you wanted the judge to include in the charge --                 -- and it's your requested charge, as to say to have an enterprise you need to have -- the group has to have an ascertainable structural hierarchy.       Those are the three words in your requested charge.                 But those -- but you did ask for those.                And now I'm asking you, what does that mean?      The judge gives your charge, the jury is puzzled:   Your Honor, we don't understand what you mean by "ascertainable structural hierarchy"; would you please tell us specifically?                And some of those examples it seems are present here.                     One you gave was longevity, well, this has been going on for 10 years; another was a unique way of operating, and they are specialists in deposit boxes and they have look-out people and they have people who actually break into the bank, and they have a certain amount of skill. So we have longevity, modus operandi, and a division of labor.      They have some people being their lookouts and other people doing other things.                       So I was looking at your list in the reply brief, and it seems to me that this organization, this association of individuals, has some of those characteristics.              Would it include, let's say, a street gang?      How about -- this may be before your time, but "The Lavender Hill Mob"?              The Alec Guiness movie, "The Lavender Hill Mob."               Isn't there a record that this is a more or less steady group that hangs out together, except when one of them gets caught and put in jail, and then they replace him with someone?                    But this is -- this was explained as a group that meets regularly in the Brooklyn Social Club?               But one of the members owned the club, right?               How about during the period that this man -- what was his name, Mangia --               Yes.          When he was running the show, it seems that he was a leader, and that the -- and that the group wasn't quite as democratic before he got sent to prison.               That wasn't what I meant.               I meant, would the organization, as it was described to exist at the time Mangiavillano was there, would that have satisfied the definition of "structure" because it had a leader?
07-1315 +++$+++                How about getting another jury?   That was -- one of the reasons that counsel gave why he, counsel, was withdrawing the NGI plea was the jury had just found -- rejected the second-degree murder charge and found that he had acted deliberately with premeditation.   But couldn't -- because the first jury had -- in the guilt phase, couldn't the attorney have requested a brand new jury to hear the NGI plea?               We should treat the district court proceeding as though it had never happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never should have remanded it to the district court, and we just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the State supreme court in the district court.                And then the district court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just applies the standard.        So that the whole thing about clearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that should be out of the case.              But there was also something about the revocation?               There were three revocations involved, I thought, two years on each.
07-1356 +++$+++                Would it make no difference, I take it, General MCAllister, if this had been a police officer who was pretending to be a cellmate?    In this case it was a snitch, but it could be a police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't do outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to interrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to be a jailbird and they can get the information that way. Is that --               So, the police know that they can get around the clear prohibition of their questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be a jailbird?               No, I am assuming we are not in the area where the jail mate is simply passive. In this case, the jail mate made a statement that encouraged the defendant.          He wasn't just passive.        He was encouraging the defendant to speak.               Anyway, your answer is the police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?               And for your -- you are talking about impeachment only.              We are not talking about the case in chief.         So if the police -- he can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and gives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?               You are making no distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment?               What about the argument that essentially this is like taking a pretrial deposition, only one side isn't represented?               Is that internal discipline verifiable?      Do police officers who engage snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they are then able to accomplish what was accomplished here? That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able to testify after the defendant testifies.               On the Federal level is there anything one way or another, any manual that instructs a U.S. Attorney about the use of snitches to extract confessions?
07-1372 +++$+++               But, General Bennett, if I understand correctly, looking to your question presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the Apology Resolution.      The question presented doesn't say anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands Resolution.    So shouldn't we just stick to the question as you presented it?       Whatever the picture is, does the Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?              Why is it necessary?   Why isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the Hawaii Supreme Court?                There -- there may well be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds, and it said at one point the resolution dictates the preservation of the ceded lands.                At another place it said that Federal law provides the basis for its decision and that State trust law is interwoven with that Federal law.    It also said that Federal law grounds the decision and provides the governing legal standards. Now, they could not have been clearer.                    They repeated at least five times that their decision rested on the resolution, that everything turned on that resolution having substantive effect.                    That's why they said that their decision was driven by Federal law.                    And I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme Court at its word repeated so many times.                We don't --              And the legislature, if they had wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act, it lists five purposes to any one purpose.              And the legislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this property -- the proceeds from this property to be for the exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native Hawaiians.   They could.       It would be up to the legislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians.               More than significance. I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the one that General Bennett brought to our attention on page 85A. It says, "Accordingly, the Apology Resolution dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved pending a reconciliation between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people." It is very fear language, dictates.            And that's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any business wading into any question other than telling the Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the resolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are wrong because it's a nice apology but it's without substantive effect.
07-1410 +++$+++                But the question --               But the question presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the Mineral Leasing Act.               That was the government's question presented.              General Kneedler, the last time -- the last time around, we remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.                      Would you advocate a different bottom line this time?
07-1428 +++$+++                That was pursuant to -- to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact. And let's take for one example a test that's given by a police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a physical fitness test, and it disproportionately excludes female applicants.             And when the results come in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the department reconsiders.        It thinks there is something wrong with this test.       It can probably test for the necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those results. Would it be similarly impermissible, similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the department said:   We're not going to -- we have got the results of that test.       We're going to throw it out and substitute another that will not have those skewed results.                Not more women on the force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of excluding most women, just as the high school diploma had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.              So they would have to go -- I take it from what you said they would have to go as far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against themselves.    They couldn't do anything short of that to prevail when it is the majority race that is complaining about discrimination.              It wasn't my --                Well, that can't be right if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy is -- is right. Suppose they had very strong evidence that the test that they had given that had these results, just as my physical fitness test that excluded all women -- that had it those results, it wasn't job-related, and there was a better test available, they wouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions under those circumstances, would they?              Then why did they have the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about -- somebody from another testing company said this is a multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could have come up with a test that would better test the skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization, but something about command presence.                    There was a term used, assessment centers; that this test didn't effectively test the skills that you needed on the job, and others did.                  But I thought the whole idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it has askewed racial results.              How do we know whether something is discriminatory or just that it will have a certain effect?    Because it's in spite of.                For example, the Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have a high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working staff, was told by this Court you can't do that because you would disproportionately exclude one race.               How does that --               I know you said that in your brief when you made a distinction between mere good faith and reasonable belief.           So how does one determine whether the concern that the employer is expressing is really in good faith or is reasonable?                 What are the indicia of reasonableness?               Can you be --               Can you be specific about what facts you think should be tried on remand?                Because you do distance yourself from the Respondents.                You are not urging affirmance of the summary judgment.                  You say there are or may be genuine issues of fact.                  So what are they?               When -- when I asked that you question, you said that one issue of fact was whether the board was acting in response to improper influence, to racial politics.                 But if it were shown that, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in fact, the majority of fire departments scotched this test years ago and substituted what most agree is a better test, even so you would say it would violate the rights of the plaintiffs you represent, even --                 Even if there's strong evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?                 But what -- what would that do to the civil service merit system that says if you pass the test you should be certified?
07-1437 +++$+++                   Isn't there something odd about saying if it's really fundamental like the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that is not reviewable?      It's not disputed, right?            That if the district court says, I lack subject matter jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?                  Though that could be a very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion, that that would be reviewable.                And I appreciate your statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that Congress would want to be firm that if the remand is for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no review, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could keep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to say the judge could keep it or remand it, that that action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.               But wouldn't it be -- here the district judge said:            I got rid of the RICO claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's no Federal interest in this case any more.                    They're all State law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye. I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a sound use of the resources of the Federal court. Now, even if you're right that this is a discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction because the discretion implies that there is power, isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals, assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the district judge about questions of this nature, the district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time of the Federal court?               But wouldn't you -- as a practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is pending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction over the State claim, but the district court is told by Congress:   It's your call; it's a matter of discretion. And the judge gives one of the reasons that's enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed, thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case. Why would a court of appeals overturn such a judgment?              But that was because we would have to retread the same ground in the State court that had already been covered in the Federal court, but that's not the kind of case that was presented here.                I know the case has lingered for a long time, but there was no processing of those State law claims.                The judge concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said "the rest of the claims I'm not interested in." So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit where there was a large investment of Federal court energy and time and sending it back would mean going over once again what had already transpired in the Federal court.              Could you explain why that is a Federal question?           It's a dispute over the ownership of this invention, right?                    So it's not a question of the validity of a patent or infringement of a patent?   It's just the invention is like any res, and two parties are disputing about ownership.              Why is -- why does that become a Federal case?               But the --               How could we do that in light of Thermtron?     Thermtron went against the clear text of the statute that says remands are not reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a district judge to say:       Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a -- this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court. The court, I think, was outraged by a district court thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was too busy with more important things. That was the setting of Thermtron, and to reach the result that the court reached, the court had to go against the language of the statute when read in absolute terms.     But anyway, the court did that, and then they gave a rationale for what the new test was going to be.     It was no longer going to be remands are no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447?                      The -- it -- the court read the statute to say less than it in fact did. That's what Thermtron did.               Well, one clear way to do it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has asked for that.    You haven't asked for it and the other side hasn't asked for it.                  But your concern is what was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.
07-1529 +++$+++               Mr. Verrilli, the defendant himself could say, "Police, I'd like to talk to you."   That would be okay.             But this is police initiation.                 Mr. Verrilli, do I understand correctly that the scenario here was the defendant, uncounseled, was taken before a judicial officer who read him rather standard information, one piece of information was, I'm appointing a lawyer for you?   Was there any opportunity for the defendant to say anything at that hearing?               He didn't get -- he didn't in fact get a lawyer.            I thought he was told that the public defender --               Right, and the actual lawyer didn't show up until later.               But, Mr. Verrilli --               -- you just struck two chords:   One, harmless error; the other, that this defendant testified at his trial.                 We have held that a defendant's statements, although he wasn't given his Jackson right, can come in by way of impeachment if he testifies.   So in this defendant's case, even if we accept everything you say, the -- that condolence letter could have been used for impeachment purposes.
07-1601 +++$+++                Ms. Sullivan, would it be altogether different if, instead of the FOB destination term, Shell continued as owner of the product until it had gone from the hose or whatever delivers it, so that there is no transfer of ownership until the delivery is complete?               The problem I have with that line you're pursuing is the FOB destination term is an eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be a punishing statute, but the one thing that was not intended was for the parties to arrange themselves out of arranger liability by providing neatly that the moment the product reaches a destination there's no continuing responsibility on the part of the seller.                Well, one benefit would be avoiding CERCLA liability through a means other than what I call the fixable connection.                     Is this the first occasion on which Shell because of its sales of D-D has been charged with CERCLA liability?                     Is this a case of first impression, or have there been other instances in which Shell did very much the same thing, delivered the D-D FOB destination?              I thought there was as part of this picture that Shell had a manual which told its purchasers how to handle this material, and that Shell was well aware that B&B was not following the precautions laid out in the manual.                 This court -- - this court, Ms. Mahoney, didn't deny apportionment. Apportionment was never requested.                  The court said: "I'm going to have to figure this out on my own."                     In fact, the court deplored the parties for following what he called a "scorched-earth tactic." So the apportionment is not something that has been denied to the PRPs in this case.                  It's something that the court thought was proper and fair, but it didn't deny any request made by parties, isn't that so?               Can you point to me the part of the district court opinion that conflicts with the part that I remember so well?                 He is saying, this is a really tough assignment; I have to figure it out.               Is it -- is it a judge's responsibility, no matter what evidence may be in the record from which one could make a finding, when a finding hasn't been sought?                But that hasn't been -- that hasn't been the position of most courts under CERCLA.   I thought they -- I thought that there had been relatively few cases where apportionment, when requested, was even allowed because the theory is the act provides for contribution.                One PRP can go after another, but the party who shouldn't be left holding the bag is the public, the innocent victims of the pollution.               I thought -- I thought -- and tell me if my recollection of the facts is incorrect, that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B to expand its operation, the waste went into a pond, what was called South, that was on the other side, that was on the original B&B parcel.             So you had the waste flowing from one part to the other.               That's not normally how -- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a burden of coming forward.          And the one thing that we do know from this district judge is he's saying, I was left largely to make it up.       What he -- the components of his allocation did not come from -- yes, there is some evidence in the record.        But ordinarily when you talk about a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean they put in a piece here and a piece there and left it to the district judge to figure out.
07-208 +++$+++   concrete illustration that was brought up by the other side.   If you have this coherent expression test, what happens to the person who has a bad speech impediment? Or someone who needs -- who isn't conversant in the English language?    Are they -- automatically the right of self representation is automatically ruled out?              Mr. Fisher, are you making essentially a "we know it when we see it" argument?    Because you're not talking about some abstract notion of what would be an abuse of discretion, but you have in your brief -- you have at pages 15 and 16 -- some examples, concrete examples of this defendant.    And you could say when it gets to that level, you don't have to wait to see how it's going to play out.    If this is how this man speaks and thinks, how could a jury be exposed to it?                  It would be gibberish.
07-21 +++$+++               Mr. Smith --              -- suppose at the time of registration there was a photograph taken right in the registration place and on the spot they gave you an ID with that photo, and everybody who registers would get one and there isn't any question of paying money to get a birth certificate.     Would that be satisfactory?            Ir that -- if you could make a photographic ID universally available, you would still have the problem of the religious objectors, but wouldn't everybody else be covered?                And you could, you could do it twice.   You could make the two trips, one to your local place and one to the distant place.                As I understand, they were going to have some years in between when their proposal was enacted, and they were going to have a mobile unit going around to all the neighborhoods, lots of advertising, because a premise of that Carter-Baker report was that everybody would easily and costlessly get this photo ID.
07-210 +++$+++               So what about a case, say, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of -- an organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of rivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those rivals to customers and suppliers, not to the -- to the rival.   So there was no -- there is no misrepresentation made to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers and suppliers. So on your theory, is there no RICO claim because the misrepresentation was made to someone other than the plaintiff?              But no civil case in that -- in that situation?               Well, why --               Why isn't it -- there is reliance on their allegations by the county.                 The county thinks that each bidder is putting in only one bid.                 So the county has been deceived, and the plaintiff suffers the effect of that deception.             Why doesn't that qualify?              Yes, but that's a different point, the point that you made in your reply brief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system, and maybe they can't prove that they were -- that they were injured; that they would have gotten a greater share.   But your case is about -- it doesn't matter even if you -- you have to accept the allegations of their complaint as true, even if everything they say in the They have no complaint is true, they have no claim. RICO claim. That's correct, Justice              So we have to assume what they say about the rotational system is right and -- but -- but you are hanging your hat on no misrepresentation was made to them.              May I just go back to a statement you made?      I thought you -- you conceded that on their allegations your client would be indictable for mail fraud?               But those -- those weren't mailed, or at least that's not what you're relying on.   You're not relying on the affidavits that make the misrepresentation using the mails.                       I thought your reliance on the mails is only the tail end of this transaction, the notices that get sent to the property owners. MR. DeBRUIN:         That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.   The mails here are an essential component to allow this fraud to have any effect.                       If it weren't for the use of the mail, the Petitioners could never realize the economic value of the liens that they obtained through the fraud.      And in that sense the use of the mails are essential to the scheme.                   And that's what this Court held in the Schmuck decision:                       That the mails, themselves, don't have to be false so long as the use of the mails is essential to the scheme. Here it clearly is.              Absent the notices given to property owners, there would be no way for the Petitioners to realize the value of the liens and obtain the benefit of the fraud by -- by making the false statements to the county and literally obtaining thousands of additional liens that otherwise would have gone to other entities.              One concern, because RICO can be a very broad statute, is that if you are right, then any unsuccessful bidder could look through a rival's submission, find a false statement, and sue under RICO. MR. DeBRUIN:        Your Honor, I believe that is not true for the reasons this Court set forth in Anza. The standards set forth in Holmes and in Anza are very rigorous tests to establish proximate cause.               So the merely assertion of falsity by a competitor -- I mean, Anza involved a competitor situation.                     There the claim was that had been mail fraud that caused the competitor harm. The Court recognized in Anza that that case was different than Holmes.            There was an allegation of a direct injury in Anza, but nevertheless the relation between the violation and the harm was far less direct than it is in this case, as Judge Easterbrook, Chief Judge Easterbrook explained.
07-214 +++$+++                What about the certificates of conformance with specifications of?             I believe they were the Navy's specifications and Allison submitted to someone those certificates of conformance.               Could the government have asked -- could the Navy have asked for them?               No.      In connection -- the Navy -- the engines are being supplied for Navy destroyers and the Navy obviously has an interest in making sure that the -- they measure up to the specifications.     So my question is whether in this procedure for dealing with subcontractors there is any kind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the certificates of conformance for those engines or other documents relating to them.              But if it's disguised, how would the -- how would the prime contractor know?              But there wasn't any trial, was there?              There was?              Well, how could -- they would have at a minimum, even if your theory is not correct -- they would have to prove loss to the government.    Otherwise they would have no claim.               Well, the government certainly has that in its brief.              Well, perhaps we should ask the government to explain what its position is.                     But one of the points that has been raised in opposition to your argument is that your interpretation would cut out claims that today are regarded as properly presented under the False Claims Act. And the one that was featured was false claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, because those are presented not to the government but to an intermediary.               So the whole difference -- the whole difference, then, is if the -- the invoices are passed on, as opposed to the government having the right, if it so chooses, to inspect the books and records?               The difference is if the government gets the invoices from the contractor, then there's a claim under the False Claims Act.               But if, instead, the subcontractor is required to make its books and records available on request to the government, that's not enough?                  But it made -- I thought you said that it is this case that the government had the right --                  -- to audit the --
07-219 +++$+++                  Mr. Dellinger, how was that rule settled?      You go in that story and The Amiable Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive or exemplary damages in those cases.                      So what is the long-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime law that you are relying on?                 That was on land on the railroad.               You are talking about maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy.                And my only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided. So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a long line of settled decisions in maritime law.               Well, the Lake Shore case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial employee.   It involved a conductor on a train.              But I thought that you're talking about a different level.                I think we ought to be clear on this.    I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood was, indeed, a "managerial agent" as that term is used in the Restatement of Torts, right? So you are talking about it's not good enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in a higher echelon in the company.                That's your position?               But there aren't many States that follow the Restatement position.               Am I right, Mr. Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was dealing with the concept of respondeat superior?                     It didn't make any distinction between regular employees and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not dealing with a managerial employee.               But I don't recall that they made anything about managerial.                     They were just talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.                Are you --                There was -- there was sufficient evidence of that.              I mean --              The jury could have found that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after voyage and did nothing about it. So the jury could have found:               Never mind the captain.    Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a captain who was certainly not fit.              It was a jury question. There was evidence both ways.               So, on this issue, am I right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get is a new trial?               And, I take it, next time around the jury would get a special verdict and be asked:     Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this captain to stay on the ship?                  Mr. -- Mr. Dellinger, before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after the jury verdict.     And the trial court, who had very carefully managed this case -- and it was a humongous case -- would never list it as an issue in the case. And so he said:     I won't hear it 13 months after the verdict. Why shouldn't we instruct the court of appeals that when a district judge does a diligent job like that one did to try to get at all the issues -- says you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after the verdict and argue a point of law that would have overtaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.               No.      Well, what did you make -- you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water Act as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made that motion 13 months after the jury verdict.               And what is the basis in the Federal rules for that motion?               13 months after the verdict.                 But I -- that's not my question.   My question is:           Under what Federal rules did you move to bring up this issue 13 months after the verdict?                 49 is on special verdicts.   What did this have to do with special verdicts?                 Rule 50 is pretty strict, isn't it?   I mean, rule 50 -- if you want to use rule 50, you have to first move before the case goes to the jury.   And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it.                   Then you move again after the jury.                And if you don't, it's got very tight timelines. And you are arguing to a court that has held that these limitations in the Federal rules must be strictly observed.      And I don't know of any time limit in the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that involve 50(b).               And you didn't appeal on that.     You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you didn't appeal on TAPAA.               Statutory.      But the statute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.              As you know, there were or at least some strong amici briefs in this case that have asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's no way to operate vis-a-vis district courts.                  What about looking at what this Court said in TXO was proper in a punitive-damages case?         That is, this spill was horrendous, but it could have been far worse. And so, under TXO, you look at what was the -- could be the maximum damage that could have been caused by this occurrence, and that could be many times --                  But it wasn't --                  -- a factor here.   I mean, wasn't the example that the captain was trying to maneuver the ship after the disaster in such a way that would have made it much worse?              Just as a class, if you take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher say 15,000 something?
07-290 +++$+++               Mr. Dellinger --              -- short of that, just to get your position clear, short of reactivating State militias, on your reading does the Second Amendment have any effect today as a restraint on legislation?              But it doesn't, as far as I know.              But wasn't there a leeway for some weapon prohibition?            Let me ask you, in relation to the States that do have guarantees of the right to possess a weapon at home:                 Do some of those States say there are certain kinds of guns that you can't have, like machine guns?              It's in interpretation.
07-308 +++$+++                 It might help if you raise that lectern a bit.                Yes, thank you.               But why shouldn't it be a suit contesting the constitutionality?                    I mean, in the usual case where you seek a refund, there are adjustments that have to be made.               But here, if the only question is the constitutionality of the tax, then what is the point of going through any kind of administrative process of the refund route?                Mr. Jay, I hope in the 15 minutes, you will state what the government's position is on this Enochs case that's been mentioned at least a dozen times. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
07-312 +++$+++               There's another assumption then that was in Justice Breyer's question about, well, you have to have the petition, the bankruptcy petition.        But in this very case wasn't the sale -- wasn't the basic arrangement made the day before the petition was filed?              But are you not -- are you questioning -- what I understand to be the case, it's not at all uncommon for a Chapter 11 these days to have the 363(b) sale of property, then have some kind of global settlement, and then distribute all the assets, never have any kind of reorganization.                   And I didn't understand that it was necessary to kick the case over into Chapter 7. Aren't there many cases filed under Chapter 11 that end up with no reorganization?              What I don't understand about the -- how the Florida system works, I thought you don't get -- you don't get the transfer recorded until you pay the tax.    I thought that's what Florida law was.
07-320 +++$+++                How is the government speaking?   You have already acknowledged that the wealthy candidate can spend as much as he or she wants and the end result of this scheme is that there will be more, not less, speech because the non-affluent opponent will now have money to spend that he didn't have before. So I think you have to concede that overall the scheme will produce more political speech, not less.                 Has it done it?   I mean, we do have some experience under the statute now.              But it was a four-year record and the numbers are rather startling that -- is it 110 senators or representatives qualified for the enhanced contributions and only 6 of them were incumbents?              Well, if that's so, one of the reasons that has been given for this statute is that it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier candidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but highly meritorious.      So -- and it gives the public the perception that the seats in our Congress are there to be bought by the wealthiest bidder.                      And if there's anything to that -- well, do you reject that out of hand as what the statute is all about?              But I thought -- I thought your brief -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- said at one stage that there is -- what Congress was driving at is a valid concern, but there are less restrictive alternatives.         And I was trying to find what those less restrictive alternatives were.               But isn't there something different between what the statute was at the time of Buckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X amount of money, and a statute that says we're going to let you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're going to give a boost to your opponent?               I'm talking about the statute as it was originally enacted by Congress did have expenditure limits and this Court said that was no good.   This statute doesn't have that problem because it doesn't put a lid on the candidates self-financing.                 Could you clarify with respect to that question two things:                      The party is not at liberty to give anything it wants.                      You explained that it would be -- it's tied to that formula.                      So the wealthy person could still have a lot more to spend. But the party also is -- there's no obligation of the party to give one cent to anybody that it doesn't choose to give money to; is that right?              Where did the money come from?   Was it a war chest left over from prior campaigns?              Yes, because he didn't -- his opponent did not take advantage of the relaxed contribution limits.               Because he was just a good fundraiser?   That --
07-330 +++$+++                 Is that based on any -- any precedent of this Court's?                So just on the cross-appeal rule?              This would not be a mathematical error?              Double jeopardy if it's a new judge?     Is that what you said?              Let's go back to where you started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what is it?   42?              -- (f).       And the -- that has two subparts, and the first part just says the court of appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in violation of law, period. And (2) has two subparts that refer to the party appealing.   So why doesn't the first one cover both sides when the second one is distinctly divided into (a) and (b) parts?              What difference does it make?   Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rule because its no rule.      What difference does it make if it is labeled "jurisdictional," or if it is just regarded as a tight procedural requirement?                 Even though the prosecution didn't ask for it?                I thought that you were relying on the division of authority between the executive, the prosecutor, and the court.                And that is that a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor brings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher sentence, the court has no authority to grant it.               Why not?      Why wouldn't the prosecutor still have control and say:                Judge, the government is asking for ten years, no more?                Why didn't the Government cross-appeal in this case?
07-343 +++$+++               Can you go over that, Mr. Fisher?   Because the -- there was a plurality opinion, right, in Coker?           And Justice Powell wrote separately, and I thought he left open an outrageous rape resulting in serious, lasting harm to the victim. He said that the Coker jury was not asked and could not have found from the facts in that case that the offense was outrageous or want only violent in that it involved a aggravated battery.                   So you don't have an opinion of five Justices saying that, in any and all circumstances, rape that leaves the victim alive cannot be punished by the death penalty.              I'm questioning -- you're saying it's off the chart because the Court held that you cannot have a death penalty for rape.              And I suggested that that's not so clear.              At any rate --              There were four justices on the plurality opinion.          That was the only point I wanted to make.               There's a brief in this case on behalf of several States, and the argument that's made in that brief on the point that the Chief Justice has raised is we can never know whether there is a consensus one way or another so long as Coker seems to cover the waterfront, so long as Coker admits of the interpretation that you cannot have the death penalty for rape, period. So the argument is on this question -- not talking about the universe of crimes, but as to rape -- we cannot know if there is a consensus one way or another until this Court clarifies what Coker stands for.              There was, at least in the amici briefs in Coker -- may not have been explicit in the Court's decision -- but the argument was made that the rape law in question, the Georgia law, came from an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as as good as dead once she was raped; and the crime was thought to be an offense against her husband or her father as much as it was to her.                 And that was the background of Coker, plus the racial element in it was very strong. I imagine that that -- if the question were -- the Coker question were to come up again, those would still be factors.    I mean, the notion was that making rape equivalent to murder was no kindness to women, because it said once you've been raped, you're spoiled. That's not -- there's no parallel with child rape. So I think that what was going on under the surface in Coker is quite different.                But it isn't -- it isn't the notion that she's somebody else's property; and -- which was the history of the rape statutes.              It was 25 years, right?
07-371 +++$+++               But --              The claim that Justice Souter has posited is not one that the second person would have been -- he was soliciting.                      He was solicited to be a plaintiff in that second case.                      That is not the case that is involved here.                      As far as we know --              As far as we know, Taylor didn't even know about the first case.                      He brings the second case.    There is no indication that it was solicited by Herrick.        So I don't know why you're even reaching the case where someone -- someone is -- you say has to be controlled, but why are we getting into the details of such a situation when we have no solicitation?              And it does cover idle curiosity.   I mean, I suppose if anyone in the courtroom were to file a request for the same information, there could be no argument that there would be any kind of preclusion just because it's been heard before.              And the judge's obligation to look out for the trial to see, for example, any settlement has to be approved by the judge to make sure it is fair to the absent class members.              The word that we use is privity.   If you are in privity with somebody else, you can -- that's a pre-existing legal relationship.              As the beneficiary and the trustee.              Which is the case here. It is the statement lawyer that's involved?              But in the case of the Chief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up, if the client sends another lawyer to bring this.                     But there's no automatic preclusion in that relationship as there is in the traditional relationship.               Why isn't that not like Montana, where the government was not a party to the case but it was in control of what the contractor was doing?              You don't think that somebody who finances -- who solicits a litigation, recruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and then says, "I recruited a very good law firm, so I can stay out of it.    I'm not going to try to -- I don't know anything about the law, I'm not going to try to manage this case."    But someone who recruits the firm and pays for it wouldn't be bound.              Ms. Stetson said that the district court unlike the court of appeals, did find collusion, and she referred to a page that I didn't check.
07-411 +++$+++               Can you give any example of that?   I mean, I found that rather surprising your brief.   The Montana -- a clear case that Montana talks about is tax, the imposition of a tax.                    Well, if a jurisdiction has authority to tax, then surely it has authority to sue to collect that tax.                    So I am not aware of a case where a State or tribe or nation has authority to regulate, to legislate, but lacks authority to And if you have an example of enforce that regulation. that, I would appreciate being enlightened. Well, I think that there's a              What was the regulation that was authorized but unenforceable in the courts?                     I don't recall -- Montana -- Hicks having said anything on that subject.              It's being imposed.      But, say, at the gas station, they don't ask you when you drive up:    Now do you consent to the tax?              But that's different from consent.    You can say I don't consent as loudly as you like and as often as you like, and you still have to pay the tax.               Well, do you recognize that the bank was on notice, at least that it was a Federal requirement that when you deal with individual Indians or what this loan company was, it was an organization of Indians -- that's what the Federal law calls it -- there is a duty of fair dealing?            The Federal law requires that.    Isn't that so?              But it's not -- it's not uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as its -- as its own on a question of civil rights.                A State might stay, well, we choose to construe our human rights law in accord with the Federal -- Federal law?              But it is an organization of Indians?                 Did they --                 I thought that the bank -- I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff in the tribal court?              And as I understand it, the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals, contract claims?              But the Long Company did not make a tort claim?              So why isn't this judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as to the contract claim, which are not challenging and which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has nothing to do with the tort claim that you are challenging?                So the consensual relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or other commercial.    So the consent is to the commercial relationship.              Certainly not in Strate, which you quoted before as saying if you have jurisdiction to regulate, then have you jurisdiction to enforce the regulation.
07-440 +++$+++                Ms. Spinelli, there's something confusing about your presentation of this, because you say that at this initial appearance that's called a magistration, you are not contending that there was a right to counsel at that very proceeding.               So when, at what point in time, did this right to counsel attach?                   If it didn't attach during that magistration proceeding, when did it attach?                 But you are taking the position that there was a right to counsel that attached in this case.     And I'm asking you at what point in time that right attached.              But that was at the magistration, and you -- you have said that there was no right to counsel at the magistration.              Any time prior -- any time prior to indictment?              So you're saying that that is the critical stage that he needed to have counsel's advice about.
07-455 +++$+++               General Mukasey, is there any indication why this prosecutor chose to hook the carrying an explosive onto a false-statement charge, instead of some charges with which it would have been more logically linked, like the one -- the first one, conspiracy to commit an act of terror -- terrorism?              So it's a difference in two respects.    One is 924(c) has the "in relationship" requirement, and it also has a shorter term.                   It's only -- in one it is five years, and the other is ten years. Is that right?
07-463 +++$+++                   Mr. Kneedler, why -- why -- why is that so?      I am reading this ARA statute, and it seems to give people a right to notice, an opportunity to comment, and to undertake an administrative appeal. Why isn't this statute that says, interested public, you have those rights, you have essentially a right to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute like FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in the Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information about APAC? These were people who said:                     We are concerned about saving our forests.                       That's why Congress said that before these actions occur, there should be notice to the interested public, comment, and we are being cut out from that seat at the table.                      It doesn't do us any good after the project has been authorized. We want to be there when the decision is made to take action.               But this statute says says before there is a specific action you have a right to notice, comment, and administrative procedures.              Maybe he has no --              Why is that different from FOIA?   I mean there anybody can request anything. You don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only have to show curiosity.        You say:          The statute gives me a right to ask for this information.               Then you are saying that this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute is supposed to operate before the project?               The question is where do you draw the line?               I thought that you said the government's position is that the line is to be drawn for cases that don't require either an EIS or an EA.     Those -- in those cases you don't have to do this notice, comment, appeal thing.                And I thought the other side is saying, no, that's the wrong place to draw the line.     It would be the same thing in every case, from the government's point of view, no environmental impact statement, no environmental assessment required, no notice and comment.      And they are saying you put the line in the wrong place.
07-474 +++$+++               What about on the Federal level?    Could a Federal employee who says just what was alleged here come right into Court to bring a Bivens action and says, I was discriminated against and similarly situated people were not, and it was irrational?     Could a Federal employee come to court with such a complaint?               And it doesn't matter that the State has civil service remedies that were not used --               -- or there were union grievance procedures that aren't used?                    You can go right into Federal court and say, I don't have to use those State remedies?                 Let's take this case. You say there were 30 similarly situated people with regard to this employee being let go.                     Wouldn't that be a contested matter?       The employer will say they are not similarly situated; each of them is differently situated.   How does that get resolved on summary judgment?                I thought they withdrew from saying that it was a budgetary matter.                 I thought you did not agree with that in your brief.                I thought --                 -- you said no hypothetical justification is there.                      Not like legislation where any conceivable basis, even if the legislature didn't conceive it.                I thought you were quite clear in saying no, that's not what rational basis means in this context.                All of those involved a group characteristic.       One involved people -- Beazer, wasn't it was methadone users?               But none of them involved a situation like this, where she is not claiming anything about being a member of any identifiable class.      She is just saying, they discriminated against me -- not because of sex, race or anything else.    They were out to get me.                 But you brought up -- you said this is 1983.      It's a cause of action provided by Congress.   So that's why this is something State and municipal employees can do, but no Federal employee could do.   1985 also uses the word "person or class of persons," and yet this Court held that 1985(3), that claim, it has to be some group-based animus, not malice directed toward a particular individual.              Well, maybe because 1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could say 1983 -- we know the classification to which Justice Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting out.              But it's a -- it's a general statute.   It's not a precise statute like Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act.                  So it's the kind of legislation that seems much more amenable to court interpretation.              Well, it certainly opens a can of worms to say that you take every claim against the government, every claim of wrongdoing by the government, and make it an equal protection claim because you say other people were treated properly and I was treated improperly; therefore, I have an equal protection claim.              I thought if you have a peremptory challenge it means that you can't challenge on any basis other than the group -- the groups that Batson has recognized.      You - you said you could challenge a peremptory, exercise a peremptory challenge if it's unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury. Well, I thought that a peremptory, outside of the class cases, is matter of the prosecutor or the defense attorney don't like this juror.              Has there ever been a challenge to the exercise of peremptory challenge on the ground that the challenge was unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury?
07-499 +++$+++                Why shouldn't the starting point be what this Court decided in the Fedorenko case?    The wording of this provision is very close to the wording of that statute, much closer than the UN covenant that you have referred to.                What would be -- what would be the minimum.      You say the statute is clear.            It requires some culpability, how would you verbalize what is the lowest standard that the Attorney General could impose to read statute to infuse in it some element of culpability?               What do you mean they were made all the time?
07-512 +++$+++                I thought they asked to have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated.                They didn't ask us to affirm it.     They said vacate that decision is wrong.               When this comes up, we usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have appointed a friend of the court to represent the position of the circuit. And here we don't have that.                We don't have anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the position.   You defend the position below.
07-513 +++$+++                  But how do you know?    How do you know?     That's the problem.                 Well, one is that you -- you are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says if it's the court --               We don't know if these records are good, bad, or indifferent.                    As far as this record shows, this could be an isolated incident, or it could be typical of what goes on.               We just don't know.
07-526 +++$+++                But we're told that that -- that effort was ridden -- ridden with mistakes.               So could you have, under your definition, a tribe that is recognized relatively recently, whether it is about 16, but that was, in fact, a tribe in 1934; that is, the -- although it wasn't formally recognized until later, it was, in fact, a tribe in 1934?               How did it get to be recognized?    I thought the recognition reflects that it's had a history going way, way back?
07-542 +++$+++                But not if it occurred in the station house, right, if the -- if the arrestee had been taken into the station house?              Well, why isn't this situation more like the station house than it is like -- the Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a driver.   They are concerned about weapons, about being assaulted.   But here we have someone who is locked up inside a police car, handcuffed, can't go anywhere. That sounds to me more like the station house than it does the urgent situation where the police have a legitimate concern for their own safety.               What happens to this car? Now, we had no passengers, just the driver.                       He is put away in this squad car, so he is not going to drive that car home.     What happens to the car?                    Let's say there was no search.     The car is there.            It has no driver.            What do the police do with it?               But suppose they didn't? Suppose they said, well, he is secure; he is no danger to us, so we are not going to search the car without a warrant.     What -- what happens to the car?                    It just doesn't stay there stranded on the road, does it?              In Belton, wasn't the notion what was within grabbing distance?                 And the trunk wasn't within grabbing distance.              That was -- and here nothing is within grabbing distance.               Could they have impounded this car?     I thought they didn't have grounds to impound it because it was -- we were just told it was parked in an alley of a private house.               So they could have impounded, and then could they have done an inventory search?
07-543 +++$+++                  But at the time -- at the time of the original reduction of credits, was there any right claimed that any of these women had?                      I mean, nothing had happened to them except there was a bookkeeping entry.      They wouldn't be hurt until they sought retirement or sought some other benefit that increased seniority would give them.                      But could they have come into court just from, on the books of AT&T, they were docked X number of days?                 Nothing has happened as a consequence of that.              But it hadn't been applied in any of those situations yet.                  At -- at the -- at the point when the person returns from leave and is docked a certain number of days, it hasn't been applied to any of the situations you mentioned.                  I grant you the case would be totally ripe if there was a better job to bid for, if there was an early retirement opportunity. But here there was nothing -- nothing to be done.               But you -- you have to, I think, recognize that there's a big difference between Evans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have to resign -- a definite act that had immediate consequences -- and this, where there -- there is a potential for future consequences but no immediate consequence of the kind that existed in your model case, Evans.              But that was when Gilbert was prevailing.   Certainly, we would not regard it that way today.               At that time, even --               -- even more so.    You -- you've said several times that it was perfectly legal, but isn't it true that the law in all of the circuits was the other way, and it wasn't until this Court decided the Gilbert case that the law changed?               But if you were -- if you were an employer and you were advising a client in, say, 1975, look to see where the circuits were, the circuits said, yes, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is surely discrimination on the basis of sex.   It wasn't until this Court decided first the Aiello case and then Gilbert that -- that that law changed.   But --              Miss Blatt, that was not the position of the only representative of the United States in the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, the EEOC, the brief in the Ninth Circuit.             We don't hear from the EEOC in this Court, but I think it was not just that brief but in the EEOC manual, they are taking a position that is 180 degrees opposite yours.                    Am I right in --               But this is not a situation like Evans, somebody who was out of the workforce for 4 years and then is going to come back and bump some people who -- who filled in while she was not working, and get that credit.             This is quite different. This is just a question of weeks.
07-5439 +++$+++                But would you -- would the monitoring suffice?        In other words, you started out by saying there is no way that it could be administered and assure 100 percent against risk, so it would be helpful if you clarified:          Yes, there is a way of monitoring adequately and tell us what that would be, or no, there is no way.              Mr. Verrilli, I think that your main argument in this case, I mean, there's -- barbituate only seems to have come up rather late in the day, as Justice Alito pointed out, but your main arguments seem to be that the controls were inadequate. So you were beginning to say what controls would be necessary to render this procedure constitutional, and one that you said -- trained personnel to monitor the flow.              Yes.              And what is --              Two questions the trained personnel be?           And, the second question, what would be the measures that they would employ?               Could you use those EMTs? Would they be qualified?           Would the team that inserts the IV, would that team be qualified?                And the government has told us they do.                In the Federal response.                I mean the people who administer the --    who place the IV lines.
07-544 +++$+++                I thought there was -- that there was this -- there were three possibilities, and one was that the defendant didn't do anything before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an accessory after the fact. If the jury believed that, then there was no way it could convict him of the crime that he was convicted of.               How do we know that?    Was there a special verdict?               How do we -- in this -- how do we know what the jury found?                    They just came in with a guilty verdict; is that right?               The district court didn't say that.               So if we were to say, Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court was right --                 That's what the district judge did, right?                 It could just review the district court's decision using the standards that the district court used?              I wasn't questioning that.   The issue, is the United States position say structural error was wrong, harmless error was right, and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district court's decision that held that there was harmless error the way it would ordinarily review a district court decision?
07-552 +++$+++               But it would be just the same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was that the aggregator gets a piece of the action?               Let's take out the de minimis one cent.                A significant stake, like the qui tam plaintiff has.              So you would have the same problems that you're complaining about with regard to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem with respect to counterclaim. That's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the prudential objections that you are making here would apply just as well.              But --               Would there be review? The FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III barriers.   So the FCC decides one way or another.             One party ends up losing.       Is there review in Federal court?              What is the advantage? You have proposed the FCC route.                That obviously wasn't taken here.   What is the advantage of going to Federal court on claims like this?              Why would the plaintiff make such a choice if the agency --               But you said --               You said the aggregator had -- that the aggregator could sue on behalf of these 1400 plaintiffs naming every one of them as a named plaintiff in this complaint and still the aggregator would run the show because they each authorized the aggregator to conduct the litigation.              Now, it seems to me that it's not very prudential to require that there be 1400 named plaintiffs instead of one.              But I thought your position was they could all join in one complaint just as long as they're all named separately.                Is there any significance to this being the -- this assignment transfers legal title.   True, there's an obligation to pay, to pay the separate PSPs.    But does anything turn on legal title? For example, suppose the -- I gather the check would be payable to the aggregator if the aggregator prevails. Could a creditor of the aggregator come in and say, stop, you owe me lots of money and I want to reach those proceeds?              No.              These are just the creditors.    Or the aggregator goes bankrupt.              But wouldn't you --              Suppose this had been mounted as a class action.           I take it you would oppose certification.              And one of the reasons would be that these are all different situations, different amounts involved in each case?                  Some -- you would have a counterclaim, not others.                  I assume you would say they're not a lot alike.                 Not at all alike.
07-562 +++$+++               Is it a question of just how you phrase it, Mr. Olson?              Is there any scope -- does your argument leave any scope for attorney general, state attorney general imposition of state law remedies against a deceptive practice involving advertising cigarettes.    To give you concrete examples, suppose a state attorney general said in every - suppose the practice were in every carton of cigarettes the cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says:                  If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes. And the state attorney general goes after that statement in the carton as false and deceptive advertising.                   Would there be any scope for that?                 So your answer then to my specific example would be the attorney general could not go after such a statement, "If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes"?               Is it the jury fracture? You said the attorney general could not stop, my example, "If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our lights."   The attorney general could not proscribe that. So nothing that you're saying turns on it being the jury rather than the attorney general, does it?               So your position is essentially that Congress, as -- as far as the advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one decisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't act then the cigarette companies can say anything they want about low tar and low nicotine?                Does the -- does the consent decree say anything about advertising low, light, those specifics?                Yes.
07-581 +++$+++                But here it wasn't.              Here we are dealing with claims that the union said:              Sorry, we are not going to process these claims because we have some tension since the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent them. So you are proposing, as far as I understand it, a situation where these workers would have no individual right at all if the union says:                  We -- we won't represent you.              Where does -- where does the contract say anything about the -- the individual succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the union and the employer?              I thought that only -- only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an individual.               But the union could not bargain about these anti-discrimination rights.                 These are rights given to individuals by Congress.                 The union couldn't bargain about them the way it bargains about collective rights, the way it bargains about wages and hours and -- and other things.                This is, this is not a bargainable right.      This is a right Congress says you as an individual have a right not to be discriminated against.    This is nothing that the union can bargain about.               And nonmembers, too? What about the people who -- who are not members of the union, but they have to pay an equivalent amount for the union's services in collective bargaining?                They would be bound as well?     They couldn't --               You said -- the -- fine. I -- I grasp your answer to that.             But you said that the employee would have the absolute right if the union says, "sorry, for whatever reason we can't represent you," absolute right to that arbitral forum. What -- who pays then? I mean, if the union is in it, then the union and the employer are going to split -- split the cost.    But what happens when the union drops out and you have the individual and the employer in this arbitral forum?                 Mr. Salvatore, would you just clarify something for me?               I thought that the union ceded its rights to the employees and said that they could use this collective bargaining agreement's arbitral regime so long as they paid for it.                    But you tell me they don't have to pay anything; the employer pays everything.               Mr. Salvatore, would you straighten out this business it seems about who pays? Mr. Frederick said that 50 percent would have to be paid by the employee.     If the union bows out and there is just the employer and the employee in the arbitration, that employee would have to pick up 50 percent.                   I think I understood him to say that.                What page did you -- did you reference?               If the -- if the idea is that the union sees this right to the worker, then doesn't have to -- doesn't the burden go with the right as well?     I mean, the -- if the union would pay, you're saying that the employer will just accept that the employer picks up the entire tab?
07-582 +++$+++               Wasn't the Commission -- the Commission asked the Second Circuit, said:                    We've changed our policy; we want you to remand the case to the Commission so the Commission can explain what its new policy.    I mean, isn't that how this whole thing arose?   The case was in the Second Circuit and the Commission said it wanted to have an opportunity to explain its position more fully?               One of the problems is that, seeing it in operation, there seems to be no rhyme or reason for some of the decisions that the Commission has made.    I mean, the "Saving Private Ryan" case was filled with expletives, and yet the film about jazz history, the words were considered a violation of the Commission's policies.         So that there seems to be very little rhyme or reason to when the Commission says that one of these words is okay and when it says it isn't.                Are there only those two words in the FCC's new policy or are there other words on the list?               How are the contemporary community standards determined in this context?               Does the FCC survey any particular audience to find out what their standards are?               That was before the Internet.   Pacifica was in 1978.               Wasn't there a different word?   Wasn't there a euphemism in the script?              I thought there was a euphemism in the script.               Because you had gone from Pacifica until 2004 with a different policy, where this kind of thing would have been okay?               Remind me about that, because there was -- the statement that the networks don't do this at all at the time of Action for Children's Television, the fight was, was it going to be from midnight 'til whatever it was.                      The networks wanted more hours for adult viewing.              They said the only hours that the Commission gave them were hours when most everybody is asleep.                 May I just ask one question?   It's about the bottom line of your brief. This whole argument has an air of really futility, because the Second Circuit more than tipped its hand when it said:     And even as they gave a reasoned explanation, we have grave doubts whether this would be constitutional. You suggested in your brief a remand for briefing and a hearing in the Second Circuit on the constitutional issue.        So, is there a way that we can say, well, really, this issue that's before us now is ignoring the big elephant in the rule, room; we have to get to that anyway?               Could that be -- could that be done without deciding this APA or are we forced to decide that?               You have the F-Word in there too, and even Judge Leval says he didn't understand why that word should be on the list.
07-588 +++$+++               The Second Circuit recognized that latter kind of taking account of costs disproportionate, more than the industry would bear, and they also recognized a cost comparison.                  If you have a cheaper method that is almost as good, you can use that and you don't have to use the one that will capture the extra fish.    So everybody agrees that there is some consideration of cost.        The question is how much, and the concern is, as Justice Souter says, that you are comparing things that aren't comparable.                 Does it make any difference --                 You have the two labels The BP, "best practical," and then "best available." And isn't it so that the best available technology, thinking of the Clean Air Act, what they call "BAT," is considered the most technology-forcing standard and then there are lesser standards?             But you seem to think that these can be --                So if it "available to reduce"?    "For minimizing" is no stronger than if it had said "available" --       if it meant what you suggest, why didn't it read "available to reduce"?                It's an ambiguity the government said it could live with.                     Now the government advised this Court not to grant cert in this case, isn't that so?
07-591 +++$+++               Well, then why -- why isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse witness?               But you would say that what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that that's all right?               May I -- may I just ask, you would extend this to a -- a breath test, a blood test, fingerprints, urinalysis?             All of those would be covered by your position?               And you answered the question that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate substitute for the analyst.           But suppose the lab says: We are very busy in this place; could we schedule a deposition; we'll present the analyst at a time mutually agreeable to both sides, rather than have the analyst on the hook to show up on a trial date?              But only if the analyst wasn't there on the day of trial?
07-6053 +++$+++               But he got -- he got on the stand, and he said some very nasty things about her. I mean he painted her as aggressive, vengeful.              Isn't there a legitimate rebuttal when he is painting her as the aggressor, and she has given a statement that suggests that he is the one who was aggressive?              But could it have come in as rebuttal of his testimony, the same testimony by the police?   Was it the police officer that --              -- took her statement? Okay.   He gets on the stand, and he says all of these unpleasant things about her.            And then the State says, okay, now we have our chance, and we are going to put in her statement through the testimony of the police officer to rebut what he has just said.              Maybe they would be wrong -- maybe they would be wrong in another case, but we have this case, and Justice Scalia has suggested, I take it, that this testimony could not come in even by way of rebuttal.                 Even by way of cross-examination.      Do you -- do you share that view?                 It may go to his credibility.    He has just painted a picture of this woman which is quite different from what her statement to the police officer would portray.               I think your answer was that in Crawford that was the situation.                       It was a spouse; wasn't it?               In Crawford.               And it was the defendant who said he didn't want her to testify.               There are some things that are not just testimonial.                For example, suppose she left a sealed letter.        She has been murdered, and the letter is to be opened only upon her death, and the letter says:    If I was done in, go after him.              Could that come into evidence?              Well, is it?   I'm just giving you --                So what's the line between what -- I understand that she is accusing him to a police officer.                So you say that's testimonial.                If she is talking to a friend and saying that she is scared to death of this man --              -- the friend could testify?              Why?              What's the difference? If this rule is going to separate the testimonial from the nontestimonial, you have to be able to tell when it's one and when it's the other.                 But the -- here it's his own murder trial.     So he didn't murder her so that she couldn't be a witness at the trial for her murder.                 But he might have murdered her because she had good grounds to get him indicted on criminal assault charges.                     Maybe he murdered her so that she would not be available to testify at such a trial.              If you're right, it would go back on the harmless error question, right?
07-608 +++$+++                  The suggestion was that Congress may have wanted to give an incentive to States to have special domestic violence statutes instead of punishing domestic abusers under a generic battery statute.               Wasn't the -- wasn't the statute responding to just that problem, that domestic abuse tended to be charged as misdemeanors rather than felonies?   And it was that fact that the Senator was responding to when he included misdemeanor.                    The whole purpose of this was to make a misdemeanor battery count for the statute's purpose.
07-610 +++$+++               Mr. Young, I thought that in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that that litigation did not have as its subject matter negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract.              I'm quoting from -- I'm quoting from that decision at page 453.                   The case involved litigation "not involving negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract."                  Well, are you saying the Court got it wrong?       I mean, the words that I'm quoting are from the opinion:        "Not involving negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining contract."                  That's the only thing that could be germane.         If it doesn't relate to that, then your case is solid.               But why isn't litigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a line between the -- the negotiation of an agreement, where Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the enforcement of the agreement.             I mean, we're not talking about litigation unrelated to collective bargaining.                     It is only litigation that deals with the meaning of a term in the contract, whether what the employer has done was an unfair labor practice, whether there has been a contractual violation.               I don't understand why enforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there you agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision you can't have these pooling arrangements.                   What's the difference between negotiating an agreement and litigation to enforce it.
07-615 +++$+++                The United States at some stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic judgment -- and now I'm quoting -- "has nothing to do with matters before the international tribunal." "Nothing to do with."               There is no counterclaim stated before the tribunal as of this moment.               There is no counterclaim in the case before the tribunal.               Explain to me why it would effect the relief?           Because suppose Iran doesn't get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets it.     It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's bill.     Iran owes money to X.           Why shouldn't the United States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment in the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor, Elahi?               Would you -- something that I would just like clarification on.                You mentioned that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth Circuit.   It has been on appeal since June of '98?               And there are cross appeals.   What are the positions taken about that judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending for ten years?               Could -- let's assume that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic judgment.     Could it take the proceeds out of the United States, given the 2007 blocking order?               You mentioned -- you mentioned that there were other claimants or others -- others who would like to execute --               -- other lienors -- other attachments.   And so, you said in the end -- well -- well, what would be the effect of those other liens?
07-636 +++$+++                  You did in your reply brief address the plan question?                  The problem is that is that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you could still lose on the plan documents rule, right.              Or he might have -- he might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that one.   We -- we just have no way of knowing.                  It's odd that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan, as I understand.              Well, because he could -- he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have controlled.
07-665 +++$+++                Before we get -- before we get away from the Government, the Establishment Clause, you said, well, Van Orden answered that, but did it?     Because you don't have here a 40-year history of this monument being there, and nobody seems to be troubled by it.                In the context of all other lawgivers.     This is a stand-alone Ten Commandments and you don't see, I don't think, anywhere "I am the Lord thy God."     That's not shown.                Yes.               If that -- if we accept that there is Government speech, I think Justice Souter's question is isn't this really the Government endorsement of the Eagles' message?                      I mean, the Eagles are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle, and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their monument.    Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in the district court there, wasn't the statement, well, this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to prevent juvenile delinquency.
07-689 +++$+++               And that -- that has been stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles factor?   So it's not at issue in this case, but the point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates.                 So there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.               But you're opening yourself to this line of questioning about the third factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in issue.   But you are opening it by having a test that looks to the second and third factor and leaves the first factor out of it.        I mean, whether you agree with it or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know what's in and what's out.          You don't have any test for the first factor that's comparable, that would give district courts and attorneys some degree of security about how you determine the first factor.               Mr. Browning, I thought there was something in the record that said never in North Carolina's history have you had African Americans able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of their choice where the minority population was less than 38.37 percent.                 Well, does that mean a proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that question?               But this -- but yours is below?   Just slightly below.
07-6984 +++$+++                In the background of this case, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the first time that his appeal had been dismissed.                 He didn't know that his lawyer had filed an Anders brief. But when he found that out, he waited some four and a half years. So why isn't the -- Texas right when it says look at (B) and (D), they would have fit his case?     He could have used those to get time starting from the date that he found out.                 It wouldn't give him four and a half years.         But why -- you say we, all we have to consider is (A); you said that in answer to Justice Kennedy.     But why shouldn't we say that either (B) or (D) fits his case?               May I ask if laches is something that the Texas court could bring up on its own, or is it for the State to raise or not as it chooses?
07-751 +++$+++                   Oh, but there is an enormous difference between the training and the character of a police officer and, as this very case illustrates, the confidential informants are often very shady characters who can't be counted on to be truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get someone for the police, because in most cases they are seeking to have their own case dealt with sympathetically.    So, how can you equate a police officer with a confidential informer, who is usually someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a dealer himself?               How about this one? Wasn't this one that fits my description, the one in this case?              There's one feature of this is that I think is really puzzling:                 What this case is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant. And here you have a confidential informer going to the place to make sure that they really do have the goods. Then he goes back to the police.                He spends two hours. He's being wired and whatever else.                      Why didn't somebody pick up the phone and get a warrant at that point?                        The confidential informer could say:                "I was there and I saw the drugs."    What -- the whole purpose of these rules is to have the police get a warrant when they can.                      And how do you explain that two hours lapse between when they had probable cause and when the -- when the informant returns for the second time?                  I thought it was established not only that there were drugs, but that he actually tasted some.                  But --              May I just establish one thing?    Tell me if I am wrong.             That this argument about consent once removed was not presented in the lower courts.    That is, in the trial court you argued exigent circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable discovery rule.    So there was -- in the courts below, this was not given as the reason, the consent once removed was not alleged as the basis, as the justification for this search?               That's -- it's not just this case.     Maybe you can tell me.                I thought because they were dealing with a confidential informant rather than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry run.     I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually the -- the undercover police officer goes in.                   The other police officers are there ready to come in when he gives them the signal.     But the police officers don't ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here with the confidential informer.
07-77 +++$+++               And it was precleared at what point?    The 1985 law was precleared before the litigation?               And it was submitted by?               Yes. litigation came. The litigation was               And so your point is that if the circuit court -- there are only two levels of court in this, the circuit court and the supreme court?  finish I would like to ask you a question about what action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the law?   That is, a mistake by the Alabama Circuit Court can't invalidate a law that the Supreme Court says on judicial review of -- on review of the circuit court, that the circuit court got it wrong. The first time around, when Jones was elected and then the Governor mooted any controversy by just appointing him.      Now we have a similar situation. We have somebody who has won an election overwhelmingly against the person that the Governor appointed.                There are, what, five months left in the term?                If your position on the law is correct, would the Governor in fact oust the person who was a four-to-one 1 winner in a popular election and install the person who was a loser in -- would that happen?         Could we project based on what happened the first time around that the Governor would not so thwart the will of the people?
07-772 +++$+++                But the question is knowledge of what.      And I thought it is now recognized that in this State you have to know not just that a crime -- you have to know in this case of the potential for a homicide.              This is -- the prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a crime, that was sufficient.             I don't find that what you've said is an accurate description of the charge --              -- of the prosecutor's summation.               What about the instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed, in for a dime, in for a dollar?                The law in the State of Washington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a dollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and you're helping in some fashion to bring about this crime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion.                      And that was tied in to the person who thought he was assisting in assault and it turns out that the victim got killed.              But what about the statement I just read, that the law of the State is you don't even have to be there if you're helping in some fashion.              Yes.          It's in the same paragraph, the paragraph with the example of the accomplice who is --              No.      This is in the summation.              What about the appellate court?    I mean, the first time around the appellate court was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the prosecutor.              Because the appellate court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et cetera, just a crime.       And the second time around that appellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know we got it wrong because there has been an intervening decision of the State's supreme court clarifying it. But what the prosecutor said, at least as I read it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate appellate court said the first time around:                 Said he didn't have to know that there was going to be a shooting.               They say, the court itself said:    We got it wrong.             We said go away appellant because you knew that a crime was likely to be committed.               Maybe so.     Let's go to the third question, when the jury asks:                   "When a person willingly participates in a group activity, is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group?"               How could the jury better express its puzzlement?          It wanted to know, if someone participates in a group, but did not -- that that person is -- is an accomplice to any crime by anyone?               And the -- the counsel for the defense says, tell them no.               It says "a group activity."    When a person willingly participates in "a group activity," is that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group?                   I don't think there is any ambiguity in that question.               They didn't get an answer.   They were told to read an instruction that they had been told three times to read and obviously didn't understand.               But we already know that many people, prosecutors, justices, misunderstood this "a crime."     Was it "a crime," or "any crime."               Or "the crime"? So I think you can't avoid the confusing nature of the statute and the charge, which repeated the statute.     It doesn't get clarified until the Washington Supreme Court says it means "the crime," not "a crime," and not "any crime."               They didn't say anything at all about Mr. Reyes.         They asked the question about an accomplice, a crime.
07-773 +++$+++               Mr. Ortiz, why isn't section 2 of the Arbitration Act sufficient to take care of the ouster doctrine, whatever may have been left of it?              I'm not sure that I follow that, because it seems to me -- where did this doctrine of ouster come from?              It came from the court. The courts said, no, we won't enforce arbitration agreements if it would oust us of jurisdiction.              Why would a court reading section 2 not say, well, that rule never made any sense in the first place, so we're not going to follow it?      It's not any rule that Congress has imposed on the courts.                 That may have been the historic model.    This was never a notion that Congress enforced on the courts.         They imposed it on themselves. So my question remains why shouldn't the Court then say this agreement has been declared enforceable, the ouster doctrine didn't have much to recommend it in the beginning, but certainly not any more; we can change it?               You just -- you just used the words "arising out of the controversy."                  "The controversy" is used in several sections of the Arbitration Act, and "the controversy" in other contexts means the underlying dispute between the parties.                   "The controversy" is not over the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
07-8521 +++$+++               But you are including then -- suppose that the result of the federal habeas is that the State -- that relief is granted unless the State retries the defendant in X number of days.             And your reading I think would be the appointed counsel on federal habeas would be responsible for representation in all available post-conviction process, and that would be an available post-conviction process.              What would?   Tell me, what would fall under "all available post-conviction process" in addition to clemency and competency proceedings?               This goes back to my earlier question:    So what else fits under "all available post-conviction process" other than competency and clemency?   What else?                Right.         But what would be included?
07-854 +++$+++ 
07-869 +++$+++                But does it get at any speech other than union speech?                I mean you say, yes, it is content-based, but it's viewpoint neutral.                   But it seems that what is banned by the statute is union speech.   Is any other organization affected?                  Does the ban affect any other organization?                   Isn't it simply union speech that's at stake?               But, in practice, is there any other application?               But I thought your whole argument was that the counties are simply instrumentalities of the State, and the State has full power over them.   It chooses to delegate to them autonomy, but it holds the control rein.                And now you're saying no, that the Federal Government can give the State local-unit authority that the State, itself, chooses not to give.      And you say that's beyond cavil. I really don't understand your argument.               Isn't there -- isn't there some State tax money that goes to fund local units?   I mean, you say here there are State taxpayers' funds involved; therefore the State doesn't have to pay for what it doesn't want to buy.               But are there State funds that fund local government entities?
07-901 +++$+++ 
07-9712 +++$+++                  Mr. Isaacson, you said there were two facts.       Aren't there three?            Isn't it a fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a crime while he was in jail?                But this judge said -- and he was open in his thinking.              He said:     "Unheard to me that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit to someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out there committing another crime."               The judge did say that. He said it was unknown to him that judges give acceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in the interval between the plea and when he shows up in court for sentencing commits another crime.                  But he could have, if he felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement because there had been the Rule 11 colloquy when it was taken, right?               When the plea was taken --               -- it was the same judge, wasn't it?               And so they were all there and the defendant was asked all these questions, and the government--       and the judge knew about the government's side of the plea bargain.               So it was not a secret to anyone that the government said it would ask for the extra acceptance of responsibility credit.                  And yet the defendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say a word:    Wait a minute, judge.             They didn't object at -- there was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?               But --               Before the judge there was no plea to withdraw the plea.                And so that's why we are -- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have a different case.     But he didn't, so we are here on plain-error review.                But Santobello was a case where there was a timely objection.              What relief are you seeking now?   You didn't -- you didn't ask to withdraw the plea when you were before the sentencing judge.              Right.              Which would expose him to a considerably greater penalty.              It did include it in the motion, didn't they?              Wasn't there a motion --              -- for credit for acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition that the defendant be law-abiding?              So isn't it odd that the -- that these documents both meant to serve the same purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct in the future and the other doesn't?               There was part of this agreement that was honored.            In fact, the judge after having said that, I never heard of giving credit for responsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the interim, but he said:      I understand there was an agreement to sentence at the low end, and that's what I'm going to do.               So if you say what you want is a trial, the defendant would be exposed to not just the upper level; plus weren't there add-ones in this case that the judge ordered to be served concurrently rather than consecutively?              Why wouldn't someone read what happened here as the defendant saying, well, I didn't get the acceptance credit, but the judge is still sentencing me at the low end, and he's still making the sentences run concurrently, so I think -- why, if he doesn't try to withdraw the plea, why isn't it the logical assumption that he says I didn't get the whole promise but I got part of it, and I'll take it?                  How do we know this one didn't?
07-984 +++$+++                  How could it be settled, because isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary purpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit applied?                So it's not in 30 years' experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was under 402 until 2002.                But in fact, was there ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose was disposal of waste?        Was there ever a 404 permit, rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call "processed wastewater" or "wastewater"?               Weren't they then thinking of fill material as material that was used either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction project?     I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place for a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily thinks of as a filling operation.                There's one question that Justice Souter raised and before you sit down I would like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place, can any waterway be a settling pond?                      That is, here we have a lake.     And is it just up to the Corps of Engineers?     They say this is a settling pond, it's a settling pond?              The definition that was adopted, if I have it right, was the EPA definition. That was the effect.       And it was the Corps that had the purpose test.    And yet, until 2002, if I understand correctly, if the only reason of raising the elevation of the lake was to dispose of waste, you didn't get a 404 permit.    That was not a 404 situation until 2002.              But in an application that never included filling a lake, raising the elevation of a lake simply for the purpose of disposing of waste.               And how do we know that life will ever be restored?            I mean, that's a guess. Nobody knows.
07-9995 +++$+++                   Are you putting -- are you equating this with a biased judge?                    The -- the category of structural error has been kept very narrow by this Court.   And it seems to me that a juror who is perfectly qualified, who it is conceded -- it is conceded could not have been dismissed for cause, is quite a different matter than a judge who -- who has taken a bribe or who has a monetary stake in the case. It -- it seems quite a stretch to apply those decisions to -- to the case of a juror who was qualified, and it was just a judge who was overexuberant in denying a peremptory challenge.               But no -- no constitutional right, no constitutional right to the peremptory challenge.               But you are not -- suggesting, because you conceded there was no basis for a for-cause challenge, you are not -- you are not saying that Gomez was unqualified or that she was biased.                          If she was biased, you had a basis for that, she could be excused for cause.               But she was an administrator.    She wasn't a nurse.                     She didn't deal with people who had gunshot wounds.                But the -- well, first, how many peremptories does Illinois law allow?               Well, suppose a State allowed only three peremptory challenges.                   There would be nothing in the least unconstitutional about that, right?               This was number four, was it?               The challenge to Gomez was the number four peremptory?               And so, if the State had only three which it could do, there would be no basis for removing Gomez from the array.                   That is, the defense would have already exercised three peremptory challenges, she's number four, too bad.                   That would be the end of it, right?        She would sit on the jury.               But there is something unseemly about saying because the State is generous in its peremptories, you have a grand constitutional argument to make, even though there is no constitutional right to any peremptory challenge?               But we had an actual jury.   It's not as though you had no jury verdict and then the court would say -- the court would say, we think that this defendant was as guilty as they come; but you had a jury with jurors who met all the State law qualifications, already made the determination of guilt. So that's a little different from the case where, say, a judge would attempt the equivalent of a directed verdict.
08-1008 +++$+++             But this is a procedural standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose, which is to restrict recoveries of penalties.               In that sense, it's like a cap on damages.                And if you're right, then the purpose that New York had would be completely undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in Federal court?            They didn't want to have class actions.            And how is it different from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs? Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative actions.            You could say just as well here that the question isn't addressed by the Federal rules.    If New York wants to say this kind of claim can be brought only as an individual action, not as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases can't be brought as a class action; we respect the State's position on that.        Why should we as a Federal court in a diversity case create a claim that the  - that the State never created?            This Court in its recent decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid the conflict. Gasperini is one such case with regard to Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule 41(b).   The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to conflict with the State policy.            But there wasn't a cap on damages in Gasperini.       It wasn't a cap.          It was --            It was that we want the courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so they won't be excessive.            So suppose in this case the New York legislature, instead of having a statute that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead of having     an encompassing statute that covered all of them, wrote into each individual statute that limitation.             So you -- are you telling me that even if New York had provided for a specific penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could disregard that and make it a class action, even if the State that created the right said, this is a right for an individual only?            Are you saying that even if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any difference whether they do it across the board, as they did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class action.            Well, does it or not?    I mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says:             You can sue for this penalty but only in an individual action.               So you are saying that even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer would be the same --            There is no New York Court of Appeals decision to that effect?            It depends upon the persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.            Because the statute may put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural policy.     I'll give you a concrete example. New York establishes a claim and says in the statute:     But this sort of claim has to be brought within 1 year.     Then New York gets a similar claim under another State's law, and it says, even though we applied our -- even though our statute applies to our own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you have no action after a certain amount of time  - we don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims in our own State. That is certainly the way statutes of limitations have been interpreted by a number of States as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive aspect.           Well, that is not altogether true, because there was always recognition that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was substantive.           I thought Byrd turned on the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the judge/jury relationship.           Well, it wouldn't matter what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment looming over that case.           How is it different from security for costs?     I mean, that's what I started with. That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that say security for costs.            Without the bond, the remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff that had to put up security for costs.             There -- when you are dealing with a Federal statute, there s a -- there s a factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause. If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say 1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our comparable claims, we don't allow class action could -- could apply that --            I can't see how that's so when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.          If they were saying, well, across the board we don't want class actions, I could follow your argument much better. But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be talking not about the efficiency and fairness of proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to be magnified.           But it didn't say that about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b).
08-103 +++$+++               Do you agree with the -- with the government that it's mandatory for the district court but prohibited to the court of appeals?           The government has this hybrid where, because of the public purposes served by registration, not only can but the district court should raise the failure to register on its own, but then the government says once you have a final judgment in district court, it's no longer open for the court of appeals to raise it on its own. Do you agree with that or do you say it's for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it, too bad?               Mr. Sims, it has been pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions. That is, back in the district court before there was a settlement, you urged before the district court that 411(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded certifying a class that included the non-registered copyright holders.    You did make that argument in the district court, and now you are saying -- you are confessing error, that was wrong?              The argument --              But still it's a statute and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory qualification on the right to sue is generally jurisdictional?              But I thought they made a distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.              I thought the Court said it was mandatory.     I don't remember when they used the word "jurisdictional."              It'S Form 19.               And that -- that, certainly, would be open.           If you are correct that the Second Circuit shouldn't have cut this off at the threshold by saying it's jurisdictional, the question of the fairness of the settlement is what you were contending.              So your position is that the district court really should have dismissed this case at the outset?             You were candid to say that this is in a hybrid category, that the government was taking an intermediate position.                     Do you know of any other provision where the district court has an obligation to raise the question on its own motion that is yet not jurisdictional?             Very, very limited.          I think Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a preclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.              What about the congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision? It provided that the -- there was to be no jurisdictional bar in criminal matters.                Didn't -- it didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it didn't say anything about civil matters.                So isn't that some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?
08-1065 +++$+++               Does that mean that, even if we were dealing with police officers who did what the prosecutors were alleged to have done at the investigation stage, no prosecutor, only police investigators, the fact that a trial and a conviction had occurred would mean that the police officers were not liable, either?              I'm not sure that I fully grasp your answer to my first question and to Justice Kennedy's, that is, yes or no, if everything that happened was alleged to have happened, but it was done by a police officer or a different prosecutor, nonetheless, the trial went on, the fabricated evidence was introduced, without any participation by the actual prosecutor in that fabrication, does a conviction -- does the -- do the police officers or the prosecutors that was not involved in the trial get absolute -- are they -- are they no more liable, not because they have absolute immunity, but because the trial and conviction at which the evidence was used overtakes what liability they might have had, absent the trial? Is that your position?              But it's strange to say you can have a prosecutor, who wasn't involved in the trial, would have liability, but as long as the prosecutor, in effect, turns the investigatory stage material over to himself, rather than to another prosecutor, then there's absolute immunity.               No, but the -- the question is not at trial, nothing about trial.                 It's the pretrial conduct.               But you said that there -- that there would be liability, as long as it wasn't the same person involved in the investigation and the trial.   Even though there had been a trial, you say -- you answered Justice Scalia, that those people separated from the trial would be liable, even though there was a trial, and it's at issue.              What about the view that Judge Fairchild expressed very simply.                  He said if this fabrication had not occurred, there never would have been any trial.               Was there no injury in the period before?     Let's leave out the trial for a moment.    There was a deprivation of liberty during the investigatory stage.             I want, before you're finished, to get a clear picture of your view of the dimensions of the claim because you rely heavily on the trial part.    Everything proceeds as it was alleged to have proceeded in this case, except that just before the trial begins, Harris comes forward and said it was all a pack of lies, and so there is no trial.              Is anyone in this picture liable?    The defendants have been incarcerated for some time, but when it blows up, they're let out.                 No trial, but everything else, the same.              You said -- I think your position is that due process begins when trial is underway, and before that due process doesn't enter the picture?
08-108 +++$+++                  Mr. Russell, am I correct in understanding that the government goes with you almost all the way, and its only the last three words "of another person," that they agree knowingly applies to "without lawful authority," and that it applies to a means of identification?          You have to know that it was -- you were using the means of identification.               If the first -- this alien's first effort to get papers that would qualify for him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time around he used an assumed name, not his own name.               He used a false date of birth.   He got a Social Security card that happened to belong -- to be the number of no live person --                -- and -- and that would not have violated.      Even in the government's reading that would not have violated --                -- this statute. But the second time around, your case, he did use his own name.        And the question was -- and it turned out that both the Social Security card and the alien registration, they were two different people but they were both live.                So that does make it a crime.    But when the number turned out to be that belonged to anybody that does not, you don't get the two-year add-on.                That's not -- that's not this case.   In this case he had his own name.              And I don't know whether there was a picture on the alien registration card.      I don't know -- he used his own name.   Did he use his own photograph?                I mean, that would --               How do these operations work?     He went to Chicago to buy false identification papers.     Did, the first time he go to the same outfit as the time he used a false name?               These are outfits that specialize in making false identifications?               Do you have any sense of -- because there are any people with false identification papers, how many times it turns out to be the number of a live person, and how many times it turns out like it was in the first instance in this case; it is just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong to anybody?               What about the government's argument in this case that Congress was really going after people who have false identification because of its concern to protect the victim, that is the person whose number is misused?                      So the government is urging that we take a victim-centered approach to the statute.               His conduct would amount to identity -- what did it say -- is there a crime of identity fraud?                It would be equally false if the Social Security number were fictitious -- it didn't belong to --              There aren't too many 15-year olds who look like they're over 21?
08-1107 +++$+++               But your case doesn't call for that judgment, because you have a multistate corporation, and it -- I assume you would be satisfied with saying that when a corporation has dispersed operations, it doesn't have its business center or its headquarters -- doesn't have its business center dominant in any one State, that it's dispersed, then you take the headquarters, because there's no way to pick among -- choose all the others, and it certainly isn't worth the labor to try to do that. So you could have a rule that says, dispersed across many States, you pick headquarters. And that -- you don't have to urge anything further.               You would never get to California's thing about State.               If you say multistate, you pick the place.      The headquarters is the place, it's within a State.              Why did the others all go through some through total, totality of the factors test?   I mean, obviously, you could pick the headquarters.   You'd say Congress wanted one place; headquarters is a logical choice, end of -- but most circuits have made it more complicated than that.                      The Seventh Circuit is the only one who said, keep it simple, as you urge -- headquarters. Why are the other circuits resistant to the solution that you are proposing.              But is it -- they -- they do it in different ways.              Some say business operations, some say headquarters.              How does -- how do the bankruptcy courts do it?          I mean, you brought out that "principal place of business" was -- was a term that the bankruptcy courts had been using before the amendment of 1332, 1958.     But I -- I don't think that the -- that it is inevitably headquarters for the bankruptcy courts.                 I mean, there's -- sometimes it is in other places, isn't it?              In the case -- this is purely hypothetical, but suppose Hertz were to be bankrupt, file a petition in bankruptcy, where -- New Jersey would be the place, on your -- or the assets are dominantly someplace else, so it would be another place?              I know, but didn't Congress pick "a principal place of business"?              And we know that they looked at the bankruptcy courts.               There are lots of expressions in other statutes.              Some say "headquarters."   Some say -- well, there are a variety of things, but Congress picked this particular term, "principal place of business." And I was thinking, when you gave the example of Texas, that the idea of diversity is you are not going to get a Federal forum where you are at home. And so one would think, well, if Wal-Mart is doing so much in Texas, it's really no stranger in Texas.              Why shouldn't there be diversity in Texas?              It rejected it, yes.              What about her argument that -- that Hertz has this New Jersey headquarters, but its reservation center is in Oklahoma?              Even -- even when the direct -- the -- even subject-matter jurisdiction is precluded after final -- final judgment after direct -- so that's nothing new.       It is the same example you gave.              Not any point in the direct -- up to denial of cert on direct review.              After that it's precluded, even subject-matter jurisdiction. You can't collaterally attack on that basis.             Yes.
08-1119 +++$+++              But there's already in the statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer who signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does not constitute an abuse.         This is 707(b).              And the words are something like "does not constitute an abuse."               So apparently it has meaning there.               Why doesn't -- why don't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also means in 5, whatever it is.              What are the words in 707(b)?    I mean, they are both in the statute.                 What the lawyer has to attest to is required by statute.               You want to -- I mean, your first point is -- and we never get to that question because lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all. They shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.               How is it any different from including lawyers within the category "debt collectors," which lawyers objected to in this Court unsuccessfully?              I thought that in the legislative history there were examples of lawyers overreaching, that the conduct that Congress was aiming at was engaged in by lawyers, as well as others.              They don't want to be -- lawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either, and in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says that -- that communication must say the communication is from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are not -- you don't have to identify.                  It seems to me that that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do, to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt collector, than I am a debt relief agency.
08-1134 +++$+++                Before -- before we get to that, the Ninth Circuit did say, now, bankruptcy judges, we don't want you to -- to intermeddle in this. So -- so the first step -- it wasn't clear to the Ninth Circuit that bankruptcy judges should not say, now, I am not going to let you do this until you prove hardship.               Yes.             Can a -- can a creditor say, oh, skip it, I know this bankrupt is going to be able to prove hardship, why go through unnecessary expense?   Can a -- can a creditor waive the hardship determination?             So he can't -- he can't stipulate to -- he will say:            I want the deal that is being proposed; I think I am better off getting the principal, skipping the interest.            I can't make that deal?   We have to go through this hardship procedure, whether the creditor wants it or not?             That s this case.       The creditor was there.     The creditor put in a proof of claim.     The creditor knew that the plan gave the creditor less than the proof of claim.             But why -- why should it be void, looking at 1327?     We have a confirmed plan.       You - you have -- 1328 does include -- except 523(a), as you pointed out.   But 1327 says "Effect of confirmation," and that says, "The provisions of a confirmed plan" -- the provision here is you get 13,000, not 17,000 -- "bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan" -- which it wasn't in full here -- "and whether or not such creditor has objected to or has accepted or rejected the plan." That seems to say at the end of the line, you get that final determination confirmed, that's it. That's as final as you come and whatever mistakes were made on the way there, you can't look behind at the confirmation.             And the only way to do it is to go through an adversary hearing with full notice, and every -- and nobody wants to incur that expense. This is a bankruptcy.      You are trying to save assets. The bankruptcy judge thinks this makes no sense.              The creditor says, okay.     But you -- you agree with your colleague that, under this 523 whatever, you must have the full adversary hearing, notice, complaint, the works?
08-1175 +++$+++               But you agree that it -- suppose we accept your position and the case is remanded.   The Florida Supreme Court could say:            Well, that's very nice, but we have a Florida Constitution with a counterpart to the Fifth Amendment, so we're just going to have the same opinion, but we are putting it under -- squarely under the Florida Constitution. They could do that?              Yes, that's what I meant. They could do it on State grounds.            Did Miranda itself -- I mean, it set out the four requirements, but there was a charge -- I mean there was a warning involved, am I not right?     Well, didn't they cite the then-FBI warning?             It has been improved considerably, but there was an FBI warning cited in Miranda itself, was there not?             It also said you have a right to keep silent.            It -- it used it in determining -- in -- in stating the obligation of the State, but it didn't use those words in setting out the warning that the FBI then gave.            It said, this is what -- States, this is what your obligation is, what you must say to the defendant is.        And I think the Florida court is the same way.     It said:       You are entitled to the help of a lawyer.     Then it spells it out in that opinion, but -- but what it said had to be communicated was not the -- the full range.     Just you're entitled, I think it was, to the help of a lawyer. So there s -- there s a confusion, I think, between what Miranda spells out and many other cases spell out as the State s obligation, what the State must do, and the statement that must be made to the defendant to communicate that.            The -- the warning that Justice Breyer has just referred to -- that s long after Miranda itself, and it was not the warning that the FBI gave at the time of Miranda.            What about the danger that Tampa, if you should prevail, will go back to the old way?   Now, it has a clearer form -- whether this form was adequate is one thing.           But now, it has the form that the -- like the one the FBI currently uses. If you prevail, then Tampa can go back to what it had before?
08-1191 +++$+++                  Why wouldn't that simply be going through the motions?               The Second Circuit put the wrong label on it, but everything it said could have been plugged into:      Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6) rather than 12(b)(1)?              How could they come down on your side if they say there is no private right of action?               Mr. Dubbs, you said something that I thought quite revealing in this -- in your brief.    I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff, Australian defendant, shares purchased in Australia.                         It has "Australia" written all over it.                      And in your reply brief you said:     "If the Plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser as this one is, Sinochem makes it clear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of an action brought in the U.S." And taking that, why not -- of the applicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged fraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of Australia rather than the law of the United States?              Not just a question of proper forum, but the proper law?              If all that were done and it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any violation.              And the communication was done in Australia by the Australian bank.               Let's -- let's go back to the question that I asked you about the appropriate forum.   You -- you seem to give this very case -- the plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser.                When the plaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the presumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less force, et cetera.    But you have an Australian plaintiff suing in the United States based on shares purchased in Australia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank. So what -- what did you mean when you were referring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens?               If we had only HomeSide's conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation of 10(b); is that right?                 But nothing has happened. Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and they didn't act on it?                Now, I concede your argument that a big component of this fraud was what went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the public.   It needed to be put out there.                  And that wasn't done in Florida by the Florida defendants.               Not if it's decided here, unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the United States taking this case is so outrageous that we will not respect its judgment.               And that's a factor, too.   It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the other.              I thought Morrison -              Mr. Dubbs, Morrison, the first-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder.                 But do you have -- you have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who bought their shares in Australia; then you have Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because he wasn't able to show damages.                 So what U.S. investor was harmed?
08-1198 +++$+++               Mr. Waxman, there s a preliminary question in this case, and that is:             There was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides, and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause permitted class treatment. The arbitrators answered that question, which they were given authority to do so by both sides, and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators answered within the ballpark. If we agree with that, then there's nothing else to consider in this case.              Where did the arbitrators say that?             Mr. Waxman, may I ask you -- because your time is running and we are spending all of your time on this preliminary question. There is one fundamental flaw, it seems to me, in your argument, and I d like you to answer it. And you can call it  the vanishing class action. AnimalFeeds wanted to be in court, not in arbitration.             You said -- and they wanted to bring a class action.             You persuaded the Second Circuit they belong in arbitration.                 So now they are in arbitration.     You say:          The only thing we consented to is a one-on-one claim.                Fine. AnimalFeeds can then say:              Fine, well, we didn't consent to anything more than the one-on-one.                  We had a class action.     We had -- we were in court.              We could have proceeded in an individual action or a class action.    Now we are in arbitration, and under the agreement, as you read it, we can't have the class action in arbitration. That doesn't mean it vanishes, because if it does, then the arbitration clause is not merely saying what the arbitrator can decide, but it is shrinking drastically the dimensions of AnimalFeeds' claim.            But that's what it was doing in court.            And -- and the court said this goes to arbitration.         What is the "this"? If it's only a one-on-one claim, how do they lose the larger claim that they had in court?            But they never -- they never gave up.            If -- if the -- if you would regard arbitration as a change in forum, like a forum selection clause, it says where you go, but it doesn't change, if you have to go to another forum, what your claim is.
08-1200 +++$+++               And your example of that couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, you should certainly check what time of evening the call is.   So you get over the first problem, but then on the second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what time zone the person is in?              Do you know why when Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't make the corresponding change in the others?             It also makes it hard to use the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the FTC.             That -- that if you have -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC, right?             But that's the only -- only way you -- under your reading that you are home free?              Do we know what the time interval was?   You said there were seven requests for affirmative responses.       How long did it take from when the request was made until the FTC responded?
08-1214 +++$+++            But why is there -- is there anything, any question about formation, given that there is a contract?         The contract is retroactive to May, so if the contract is retroactive to May, then certainly a contract was formed and that issue is -- is academic, but --           But why does it matter? Why does it matter if we have a contract?             A contract has been formed; everybody agrees about that.             And everybody agrees that the effective date is May.          If the contract had read, not simply "claims arising under this contract," but in addition said "including the formation or breach thereof," if the -- if the arbitration clause had included formation, then you would have no argument.          It would go to the arbitrator.
08-1224 +++$+++             What was the experience under 4246?   You pointed out that that has been on the books for some time, and there efforts must be made to have the State take the person. When the civil commitment is used following the end of a term -- let's say someone is insane -- how often does it end up that the State takes responsibility and how often is it that the person stays in Federal custody?          But the likelihood is that the person will stay in Federal custody?          Are you saying that as far as those limitations, the question that Justice Sotomayor was asking, the limitations on the Federal Government would be the same as they are on the States?   But that s a different question from whether the Federal Government has any power at all.          So, is the prisoner --          Is it -- is it a prisoner who has served his time in, say, a Federal penitentiary in Ohio but is a domiciliary of Arizona, what happens when the prisoner is released, say, after 10 years?    Released to Ohio, sent back to Arizona? What?          Was it -- was that a consideration?    You mentioned that this originated, 4246, with a -- with a committee of judges who said, we have a problem.    Did they --
08-1301 +++$+++               Mr. Rothfeld, would you clarify one thing?   You re not questioning the Attorney General's determination that the underlying sex offense can have occurred pre-SORNA?            Do you think part of it is there was a -- SORNA requires a lot more information than was required under the State statutes?
08-1314 +++$+++        That's what the statute calls for, minimum.       That the agency is to set minimum standards.     And then I take it that the Court in Geier says it wasn't -- it wasn't a minimum standard, because if a State deviated from it, it would detract; it would be an obstacle to the realization of the Federal standard. But here the -- a minimum standard was adopted, minimal standard, and I think the agency is telling us just the opposite of what it said in Geier; right?       I think what you are saying -- the statute says "minimal standards" and the agency says "no obstacle," and that's it, that if there is a preemptive force to the -- to the safety standards, that it is for the government to say that.       Why are we looking to Geier when you have a statute that says common law remedies are safe?     I mean, as long as it says that - maybe it didn't make a whole lot of sense, but they did it.
08-1322 +++$+++               What would happen in the case -- in case it is a prisoner who is this prevailing party?     Would the -- would the attorney fee be paid to the prisoner?           And if not, to whom would it be paid?               Where is the agreement between the party and the attorney?                      The Equal Access to Justice Act provides that fees will be paid to the prevailing party.    Where does the prevailing party have a contract with the attorney to turn the fees over?               You said that pursuant -- maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you said that there is a contract between the prevailing party and the attorney.   And where is -- how does that contract come about if it's simply a case that the lawyer is representing pro bono a plaintiff?                 That sounds like you're -- you have -- the client has an agreement to pay the lawyer or the client has paid the lawyer.                      It would make sense if the client has paid the lawyer and then there is reimbursement under EAJA that what -- what you're describing would make sense in that situation. But in most of these situations, the client doesn't have the wherewithal to pay the attorney upfront, of course.                And does that mean --                The award goes to the prevailing party.    So, therefore, the attorney's fee is income to the client --                -- is taxable income to the client?                Like pain and suffering, but that's not --                And then, in turn, income to the attorney when -- if the client --               What would that be in this case?    What was the -- the amount?
08-1332 +++$+++                 In addition to -- that was said at the meeting -- and Lieutenant Duke, who was the same one who later says:                I'm not going to monitor as long as you pay the difference.                   There was the statement at the meeting by that same person.                   Wasn't there something in writing by the police chief to follow up after that meeting?                Then, according to what you just said, the jury determination was superfluous. If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy because the officers were told this is just -- we treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it can be made public, then there would be no reasonable expectation of privacy and there would be no question to go to the jury.              If we take it that the Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given, then how can the department lawfully use the transcripts?
08-1341 +++$+++                Are there errors that are -- that are so basic that they would call for an automatic new trial?     You say this -- this is not such a -- such an error.            What do you mean by structural ?            Yes, but if you can be concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what else would be structural?              What about the argument that was made that in the pre-enactment period the Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to date?
08-1371 +++$+++               But, Mr. MCConnell, Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean in her deposition said, loud and clear:                  "Our policy is all-comers.    Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the Democratic group and vice versa."                 So unless you are challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating, as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see how we can listen to your argument about the so-called written policy.                 But, Mr. MCConnell, here is a statement, a stipulation.                 It's a stipulation for summary judgment.      It says:            District Judge, you take this to be the fact:         Hastings requires that registered student organizations allow any student to participate, become a member, seek leadership positions in the organization.    That is not qualified.                    It says: District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate. It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not really enforced.      It's not qualified at all.             And is --             And Hastings takes the position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only among the groups but within the groups.                   So --             It is that they --             They say, yes, we believe in diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity within the group; that's a good thing.                   They are not backing off from:   We think diversity among groups is fine.              It may be --              It may be an ill-advised policy, but the school says:              It's our policy.         It's working fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about sabotage, takeover, they haven't happened.              Mr. MCConnell, let's say it is the belief of this group, based on their reading of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible studies, can become officers of the group, and that's based on their fundamental belief that that's what the Bible instructs.    On your view, must Hastings give this organization status as a recognized student organization?              But the belief is -- this is the belief.              So, they -- they would have to negate their belief in their practice.                They could believe this, but they couldn't implement it?               Mr. MCConnell --               Mr. MCConnell, you don't challenge that there are universities, including four law schools, that have an all-comers policy?               There are private universities.
08-1394 +++$+++              But he did -- he did give time for counsel to ask additional questions, trial counsel.             He asked both sides if they had additional questions.              You made a change of venue motion at the outset, right?              And I'm unaware of any case in which we have said a change is mandatory when what's involved is money rather than life or limb.              Life or limb obviously was involved in the MCVeigh case.             Well, what was remarkable about some of those questionnaires, there were a lot of people didn't read the newspapers.               There were a lot of people who indicated they really didn't know anything about this case.            But there was some follow-up to that.              Was there a challenge for cause against her?            And I thought part of the government's theory was not --            -- wasn't limited to the compensation.     It was essentially Skilling owned shares, and he had information that those shares were inflated. Shareholders owned shares.          They didn't have that information.     Skilling then sold those shares at a great profit to himself.     And the shareholders were left without that information.         And then when the stock price plummeted, they all lost out. I thought that the government was not limiting the -- its position to the compensation, but was also dealing with the share price.            May I --      I just don't -- because I'm looking at page 50.                I thought this discussion goes from 50 to 52, and that the part on 52 certainly homes in on the share -- the shares.            Why -- why do you put in the "i.e."?   Additional personal benefits could be both.            I think we ll ask the government to do that.
08-1402 +++$+++           I think your point was that Duren was quite different in the numbers --          -- starting out with women 54 percent of the population, and then dwindled to 14.5 percent of the -- of the jurors, available jurors.             But you -- but your test is 10 percent.     And if you have a minority, what is it here?   7 point -- whatever it is.             7 --             It's under 10 percent. That would mean that a district is free to just disregard all the people who are under 10 percent of the population.          Didn't the Michigan Supreme Court do essentially what Justice Alito suggested, that they said:       We ll give you the benefit of the doubt, go on to the third. But on that third, it seems to me there s nothing that shows us what was the representation in the district before they made the change vis--vis the circuit courts, was there?          That -- that's in the -- in the circuit court.      Do we know what the figures were just for the district court?           And then they would not have -- have gone on to the systemic issue, because the disparity was so marked, just on the -- just on the numbers?           One point of information What is the Michigan ID?
08-1423 +++$+++        Mr. Englert, also talk about what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then.     It seems 602(a)(2) is dealing with infringing goods, with pirated goods.     So given the first sale doctrine as you construe it, what does 602(a)(1) protect?       May I ask you -- I see that 602(a) is now broken into (1) and (2) and it's 602(b) that you put entirely in quotes.     But what does 602(a) shelter?     How does it coexist with the first sale doctrine?       There was a concurring opinion that says -- that said this case is about a round trip and doesn't talk to goods that -
08-1438 +++$+++        Now, what would it be, Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a Federal penal institution was not allowing for the religious practices that the act protects?       In a suit under RFRA, could there be -- would damages be an appropriate remedy?       Well, could we back up. You are saying you could get them against the Federal Government too, but the government doesn't think so?       Mr. Russell, the State looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no damages without having a physical injury.     So putting the PLRA together with "appropriate relief," PLRA is telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no physical injury.       But in the prison setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because there are not going to be damages anyway?       But the answer to Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area, zoning for example, those are mostly cases against municipalities or counties?       Not against the State.       But those cases did not involve States, right?       And I think that the - the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito just posed it:     the State is being treated with less dignity than the Federal Government, because your position is that the Federal Government is shielded by its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not.       But the waiver -- I mean, on the State side they can say it says "appropriate relief."     All right; we accept that we are going to be vulnerable to an injunction suit.     But we're the State and it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief. We didn't waive it.     It's not -- doesn't say in the Spending Clause legislation that we open up our treasury.       But then you're bracketing the State with counties and municipalities. It really comes down to a question -- who decides whether the state fisc is touched.     And why isn't it most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so explicitly.     And then there is no doubt when the State enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money damages as well as injunctive relief.
08-1448 +++$+++        What's the difference? I mean, if you -- if you are supposing a category of violent materials dangerous to children, then how do you cut it off at video games?     What about films?     What about comic books?     Grimms' fairy tales? Why are video games special?     Or does your principle extend to all deviant, violent materials in whatever form?       But California doesn't do that.     California has in big letters "18."     So it's not -- is it okay for a 7-year-old?     Is it okay for a 12-year-old?     Part of this statute requires labeling these video games in big numbers "18."     So it's 18, and California doesn't make any distinctions between 17-year-olds and 4-year-olds.       May I go back to -- to what Justice Breyer was asking?     Because this Court, with respect to the fighting words -- Chaplinsky and "in your face" and provoke an immediate action -- the Court has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't have this spillover potential.     So you -- you didn't latch on to fighting words.     Your analogy is to obscenity for teenagers, as I understand it.       Does California -       California has a Ginsberg-type law.       Is there -- you've been asked questions about the vagueness of this and the problem for the seller to know what's good and what's bad.     California -- does California have any kind of an advisory opinion, an office that will view these videos and say, yes, this belongs in this -- what did you call it -- deviant violence, and this one is just violent but not deviant?     Is there -- is there any kind of opinion that the -- that the seller can get to know which games can be sold to minors and which ones can't?
08-1457 +++$+++               But here the court of appeals said that the Act does two things.                   First, it said that the full board can delegate full powers to any three-member group.     That was step one, and that was done here. And then it says there's this rule that a quorum is three, but then it said:                  Except as to one of these three-member groups that has been designated, except, and there the quorum is two.                    So why doesn't the statute answer the question that, yes, a quorum is three, except when it's two?                But it's not an agent of the board because the three-member group that has a quorum of two has the full powers of the board.                    So the statute doesn't say anything about a three-member group that has a quorum of two being an agent of the board.               But where does the statute make that three-member group with a quorum of two, a quorum of two, an agent?               It says they may be designated to exercise any and all powers?                The D.C. Circuit I think was the source of your opening argument because they said when the number drops below three there is no board, and I guess that's what your opening argument was based on.              There have been situations before where the board dwindled to two members.     Is this the first time that the board has continued to adjudicate the cases that they can, or when there were prior periods with only two did the board continue to adjudicate?                 Heard an initial -- an initial decision.     But just -- the review of the panel is in the court of appeals, right?                 So you could have initially a panel of five, but that would not be reviewing the panel of three?              Is this different from the practice that some courts of appeals follow of circulating a panel decision to the full court some days before it's issued to the public?                   That doesn't put the non-panel members on the panel.                 Is this practice that you are describing the same or is it different?                But that's quite different from the court of appeals sitting en banc. The practice of circulating the opinion does not put all of the members of the court on the panel.               At all times "except."
08-146 +++$+++                Before you leave the text, it says as you -- "referable to arbitration under an agreement," but then it says "shall on application of one of the parties."        How do we know whether that is parties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration agreement?               In practice, are there decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay under section 3? I mean, one question is -- and that's the question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the action pending arbitration.             Have there been cases in which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement but is a litigant in the case?              Well, the question -- ability is one thing.      It means they -- they have the capacity to apply under section 3.                 I was just wondering how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter. One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the enterprise that they are advising.                  The other two, sophisticated players, do not. My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two such people who were perfectly equipped to get an arbitration agreement themselves and didn't.              Do we have any situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the one party who has the arbitration agreement with Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there is an automatic stay of any litigation against Bricolage. The one party that has the arbitration agreement is out of the picture, so you have an arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to enforce:   The difference between parties to the litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying on an arbitration agreement effectively without two parties to it.               But if you have a party to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, doesn't that change things?                But if you read section 3, if you interpret, as you do, the word "parties" to mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party to the litigation?      Yes.       End of case; they can move for a stay.    Then whether they're entitled to one because of this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by the State law is a merits question. You are making a more complex jurisdictional argument than I understand.              What's wrong with the simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here are parties to the litigation.                Therefore, they can move for a stay of the arbitration.                And then we go to the merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying the arbitration? But you're presenting a more complex argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite understand.               First, is there jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction.                  If you -- if there's an application to stay, is that appealable? Why isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes?               But your step -- you seem to be involving some merits question of State law in that question.                You shouldn't do that. You should tell us, this is the jurisdictional argument. If we pass that threshold, then we get to the merits.                Good. (Laughter.)                May I ask -- may I ask? Suppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation but is not a party either to the arbitration agreement or to the litigation?                I'm asking of somebody who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to which that person is not a party, and the court says of course not.     Would that be reviewable on appeal?               That's your jurisdictional argument.               And you're saying that's all that's before us because it was thrown out --
08-1470 +++$+++               But he didn't -- he didn't waive them.   And quite unlike Butler -- Butler, if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you."            So that was a statement --              -- that he was waiving the right to remain silent.          He volunteered to talk. Here there was no such indication that there was a waiver of his right to remain silent.              We didn't say -- we don't have any decision that says the police are home free for 2 and a quarter hours.      You said that that this was not lengthy interrogation.              But we -- we have no decision that says that the police, faced with a silent suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that that is not lengthy.              He said "yeah," "no," and "I don't know."              What page is --
08-1498 +++$+++             But if you can't travel there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can meet with and discuss lawful activities with people there.     If you can't get there, you can't speak.             Mr. Cole, as I remember, Scales upheld a conviction, wasn t --            Mr. Cole, would you distinguish -- I think this came up in the court of appeals.    There are a lot of groups on the list.             I think the Al-Qaeda was one instance that was mentioned, and, at least according to the briefs, you conceded that if you wanted to do just what you describe with respect to the Kurdish group or the Tamil group, the ban would be permissible, if the group -- if the group were Al-Qaeda, and I ll throw in the Taliban.             Well, then -- then as -- suppose the group is not the two that we have here --             -- but Al-Qaeda and the Taliban?             Do you want to give an answer to the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda?
08-1521 +++$+++             Are you saying that the rights -- if you could clarify your conception of privileges and immunities.            Am I right in thinking that to keep and bear arms would be included even if we had no Second Amendment, as you envision privileges and immunities?            But -- just tell us the dimensions of what it is.         I mean, we have the eight amendments, so I know you say that's included.             Keep and bear arms would be included even absent the Second Amendment.     What unenumerated rights would we be declaring privileges and immunities under your conception of it?                But that -- that court does not have the prerogative to overturn any of this Court's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much. So it was kind of a pass-through in the court of appeals. But I really would like you to answer the question that you didn't have an opportunity to finish answering, and that is:      What other enumerated rights? What does the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship embrace?             Yes.               Even though -- even though a large portion of the population at that time didn't have those rights?               No, throughout -- throughout the nation at the time.               Did married women at that time across the nation have the right to contract, to hold property, to sue and be sued?            Does it work just one way?   I mean, if the notion is that these are principles that any free society would adopt, well, a lot of free societies have rejected the right to keep and bear arms.            But this -- then it's not one expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights, or the rights that any free society -- basic to a free society.    So you -- you have to trim your definition. It's not basic to any free society.             So you are saying that under -- under your view, every State would have to use a grand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information. And that every State would have to have a civil jury, if any party in the case requested it.               Is that --             That's a criminal case; that's quite different.
08-1529 +++$+++             What are the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act?         I thought that they were -- they applied to all Federal employees?            Including the Public Health Service.            And that's a -- there s a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.             In this case it's California?             Which would put a lid on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000?            Mr. Shah, is that -- is that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez Act and there s 233(a), and then there is the swine flu. Are they all -- are all those provisions, provisions like 233(a), that say "any civil action"?            Could the -- could the plaintiff contest the certification that this was within the scope -- and say it was so egregious, it was outside the scope, and, therefore, it doesn't come -- come within 233(a) or anything else, and so we have a straight claim against the defendants?             Or they would lose their argument against the -- I mean, they would lose their claim against the government if they were taking that position?
08-1553 +++$+++             I thought the government told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in the case because it was either waived or something.             But the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand, COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States.            Yes, but uniformity is one thing when you re talking about 50 States and another when it's just two Federal statutes.             Where -- we re looking where, now?
08-1555 +++$+++              If you are right about that -- I guess it would be the same under the Alien Tort Statute -- then the Filartiga case -- if the -- if there had been a quest -- request to dismiss because Filartiga was a former officer, and the same thing in Karadzic, none of those could have gone forward?             Is there -- is there any Alien Tort Statute or the torture statute that would have survived, under your view, because your view is it's no exception under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, end of case?             Yes, but that doesn't -- that's not going to happen. (Laughter.)            Well, when you -- going back to where you started -- you started saying the officer must go together with the state, because in reality it's the same thing; it's a suit against the state. But this is a case seeking money out of the pocket of Samantar and no money from the treasury of Somalia, so why is the suit against the officer here equivalent to a suit against the state?             Well, that sounds like you're -- you're talking about an  act of state  doctrine, not that the suit against one is the equivalent of a suit against the other.            I'm not sure that I followed your distinction of the domestic law, per se, because say, the Federal Tort Claims Act, to come within that Act and to have the government cover it, the officer has to be acting within the scope of her employment, however careless or reckless she may be.               How can you maintain that position when the Department of State takes the position that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act applies to a state and agencies and instrumentalities, but it doesn't apply to officers?    If it was all that certain that they didn't even have to put it in, then is -- the State Department is being recalcitrant?                How does this case --               How does this very case establish a rule of law for the foreign state? The Act is aimed at torturers.             The remedy comes out of the private pocket.     How does this establish -- if the thing plays out and the plaintiffs prevail, there will a remedy against an individual actor; there will be no relief awarded against any government.             How would it set a rule for the foreign government?              Never mind that this person has long lived in the United States, in Virginia. It will have no effect -- will have no effect whatever on the government of Somalia?
08-1569 +++$+++             Is the life part of the --            -- what the substantive crime was?   Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was? Is that -- because this is -- you're -- you re saying this is an add-on to an underlying offense.            Well, then -- then you wouldn't be relying on what might be a life sentence for the underlying crime.            Yes, but where do you get the maximum?     You say, oh, these are just minimums.            But where is -- where is the maximum?             Why can't we just say, as Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response to Castillo.     And they -- they made it read more easily. We know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding possession, which was not there before.               So they added possession.     They made it more readable. Some of the concerns that were expressed in Castillo are certainly present here.               There is a huge jump from a 5-year add-on to a 30-year add-on for -- for the machinegun.     So why don't we just say, well, this statute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to Castillo?     It's not all that different.
08-192 +++$+++               Can you be specific about who those persons would be?             You say not a misdemeanant drug user.   So who would be caught in the 843(b)?              Yes.                Yes, I would like to -- who does this target?      The girlfriend is a good law school exam type question, but in the real world who is covered?               This statute doesn't -- it doesn't differentiate between buyer and seller in terms of who makes the call.            I gather the purchaser for his or her own use would be just as susceptible to this statute if the dealer called and said:                  I've got a gram of cocaine; I know you're interested in having it.               That was changed in 1970, wasn't it?     Wasn't the text "offense" originally, and then Congress changed it to "felony"?                You didn't -- I haven't heard you question so far the government's rationale, the reason Congress did this is it's more difficult to detect a drug deal when it's by telephone than if it were an encounter on the street or in an apartment.                You have not questioned that?                But it could be a -- a separate crime, the use of a machine gun in facilitating -- in facilitating a crime, any crime.                  That could be --
08-205 +++$+++               Mr. Olson, are you taking the position that there is no difference in the First Amendment rights of an individual?                A corporation, after all, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable rights.   So is there any distinction that Congress could draw between corporations and natural human beings for purposes of campaign finance?              Would that include --              Would that include today's mega-corporations, where many of the investors may be foreign individuals or entities?               Own many shares?               Nowadays there are foreign interests, even foreign governments, that own not one share but a goodly number of shares.               Could they in your view, in the view that you are putting forth, that there is no distinction between an individual and a corporation for First Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation, even -- even if most of the investors are from abroad, Congress could not limit their spending?                But what are the -- you have used the word "prohibition," Mr. Olson.                     One answer to that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it is a question of not whether corporations can contribute but how.   They can use PACs and that way we assure that the people who contribute are really supportive of the issue, of the candidate. But so the -- the corporation can give, but it has to use a PAC.                Who is the "you"?         I mean do you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not the shareholders?     We don't know what they think.               But what about the district court's finding?         Wasn't there a finding before the three-judge court that Federal officials know of and feel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads urging their election or the defeat of their opponent? There was a finding of fact to that effect, was there not?               So if -- so if they just covered large corporations, so you take out the mom and pop single shareholder --               Not 97 percent of the contributions.   I mean, the contributions that count are the ones from the corporations that can amass these huge sums in their treasuries.               Mr. Abrams, Times v. Sullivan was not -- did not involve overruling precedents of this Court that had been followed by this Court and others.     So, I think the situation is quite different.               There was no -- there was no decision of this Court, I mean --               We do tend to adhere to our precedents --               -- especially a case like Austin which was repeating the business about amassing large funds in corporate treasuries.                     It was not a new idea in Austin, and it was repeated after -- after Austin.   But there was -- so Times v. Sullivan I think is quite distinct. The question that was posed here is, is it a proper way to resolve this case, to overrule one precedent in full and another in part?             But what the Court said in Austin it also said in the NRWC case, which was I think 8 years before Austin.            So Austin was not a new invention.             But there have been limits on corporate spending in aid of a political campaign since the turn of the 20th century.             But that's not -- the -- the statute that we are involved in, in this case does not cover those.              Justice Marshall said that he was not trying to equalize all voices in the political process.     He has a sentence that says, well, that's not what the rationale of this case is.
08-214 +++$+++                Mr. MCCreadie, in this case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act?                If we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently false, the allegation for example that he deserted his post.   He says it's false.         He said the allegation that he falsified his application for employment is false. Accepting the -- that to be true at this stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in that way?               Yes, but -- but now we're at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint.                We're assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.               But let's take this out of the maintenance and cure spot altogether.                Litigation generally, if a court determines that a litigant is abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings, is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?               I thought that all that was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.                The allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure.                 They suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice, standard operating procedure, makes false claims before a court.    And my question to you is, isn't across the board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?               How many --                You said never in the history.    I mean, there -- there are examples like the ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were called exemplary -- but when you say never has there been before or after punitive awards.                     But there is precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in maintenance and cure cases.                 Did this Court ever hold that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no punitive damages?    Do we have any holding to that effect?               Mr. MCCreadie, there's a question about this case, a troublesome feature of it. That is, you are saying because there are no punitive damages available under FELA and under the Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under maintenance and cure.     But if we have to answer those questions, whether there are punitive damages available under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much larger question than are punitive damages available for willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure.               We're deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that the law cares about particularly.               But there would be a larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the Jones Act context and FELA.           And to decide those questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.              I thought there was -- it was on the high seas.      They had DOHSA.              At the time of Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you weren't on the high seas that was the gap.                  Wasn't that the case?               But that's what the common law was.     That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act. That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you collect. That was fixed by statute on the high seas, DOHSA.     Because there was the gap, there was no Lord Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up, right?     That's what it did in Moragne.              Are you -- are you then disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are not tied with a Jones Act claim?
08-22 +++$+++                Does it mean the same thing as likelihood of bias?               To what --               To what extent do you rely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that you have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in fact a prime culprit from the point of view of the plaintiff?     That is, Blankenship, who made all these contributions, is charged with driving Caperton out of business.    So he is not simply the CEO of the company that's named as the defendant, but he is targeted as the perpetrator.     So that's an -- an additional factor. Is that just one of a laundry list, or is that central to your view that there is really an appearance of impropriety here?
08-240 +++$+++           But that -- on that point, the government differs with you.             The government says, as Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing as constructive termination, and you must terminate.           Your position is that the franchisor has to be the one to terminate?           So that the franchisor can do outrageous things -- triple the rent, double the price of the fuel -- and you would say, even so, there s -- that doesn't count as a termination because the franchisor hasn't terminated?           And could you, Mr. Lamken, straighten out what happened in the district court? Because I take it there was an award for breach of contract as well as one for termination and they were in an identical amount.       So what happened to the breach of contract?           The award?           That's a rather significant difference.
08-267 +++$+++               Mr. Shah, how does that differ from the general rule that a judgment becomes final and has preclusive effect once the appellate route has been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired? It seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule that applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil cases, stating when a judgment becomes final for preclusion purposes.               Where in your view, in that the government is putting forward, can this -- can Denedo go?   He said, I was misinformed by my counsel.                 I never would have entered a plea if I had known I would be subject to deportation.           And he said, I never found out about it until what, 8 years later, when the government -- 8 years after his conviction, the government said, you're subject to deportation.              Where can he go with that plea?               We're assuming now, because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by the government's action, so he was unaware and, therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier.                 You have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just out of any court.                  Mr. Shah, you just said something about -- you answered my question and Justice Stevens' question:      This person is out because it's too late for him.   He was convicted in what, was it --                  Yes.          And the government never said anything about deportation until 2006?                      And they went through -- he twice applied for naturalization, is that correct?                  And he was turned down on grounds that had nothing to do with deportation.                      The government never alerted him to the possibility that he would be deportable.        They turned down his application with no hint of that, and you say that he is -- he's out of time, but nothing counts against the government because of that 8-year lapse?               Is it available to someone who enters a guilty plea?              But I thought the Morgan case said that coram nobis was not dependent on any independent basis of jurisdiction.                  Didn't the Court say that a coram nobis application challenging a conviction is a step in the criminal case and not like habeas, where relief is sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate proceeding?
08-289 +++$+++               What was the year, Mr. Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the bilingual education?      What was the year of that?               And yet the district court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times after the SEI became effective.                And we -- we have the original decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment in 2000.     Then he issues a series of order.                  None -- and none of them are ever appealed.               Mr. Starr, can I take you back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you seem to have shifted ground?             The 60(b) motion as presented to the district court said that this new law passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- "2064 creates a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL students." That was the whole basis for the 60(b) motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the new law.    Your current argument is detached from the new law.               But that was the basis for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate funding.              Do we -- do we have the -- the intervention application in the papers before us and the 60(b) motion?              Well, what is it -- No Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving clause, "Nothing in this part shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil right."   And the EEOA is such a law.              That was the fault of the Arizona attorney general, who told the court:              You cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have to be treated equally.        So, it wasn't the plaintiffs that initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in fact the Arizona attorney general.               But that came in in 2000 and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years before there was ever an argument.                  I mean in all of these orders that were not appealed, don't those judgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?               I didn't think there was in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this much on teachers aides, that much on the other.                It was: You need a plan and you have to figure out how much it costs, and then you have to appropriate money that matches the cost. But the district court -- I may be wrong about this, but I thought that the original declaratory judgment didn't try to tell them what the components of that plan had to be.              But he was speaking alone for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal. What wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by Federal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a statewide system of English acquisition programming.
08-295 +++$+++                   Mr. Ostrager, you have characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the Second Circuit did not.        The Second Circuit said:       The confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the insurer's obligation to cover Manville's liability.             The Second Circuit said:      Now, this 2004 order, which concerns independent actions against insurers for their own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they affirmed.   So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a collateral attack on the 1986 order.               At the time of the 1986 order, had these independent actions started?             I thought at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits involving Manville's liability and the insurers' derivative obligation to cover.               The insurers, to the extent of the insurance proceeds.                That's what created the pot that made the settlement fund.                  But what I'm trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only information we have is that Manville -- there was the conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief.                  This question came up, well, what about actions against the insurers for their own wrongs?              And the answer was, oh, those aren't covered.               The Second Circuit's view was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's liability is not in question.             The Second Circuit thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is between two- the question is between two nondebtors, Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other, Manville is not in the picture.              That's what the Second Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the bankruptcy court, and that could be wrong or it could be right.   But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors' liability to the claimants.                 The direct actions against Travelers.               These were cases in the State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of them have succeeded.               How could you say they ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524, and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called direct actions, which really aren't what we generally call direct actions.      But the Second Circuit did address what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville device.               May I interrupt you there?    Because you told me that the Second Circuit ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the petition for cert and the Second Circuit addresses 524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages. I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.               And may I -- may I have an answer to my question about the Second Circuit ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages to it?               Another mystery in this most mysterious case:     If it was so clear that the original order, the 1986 order, insured Travelers that it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period, then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it had put up originally, in order to settle with people who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?                 What was the difference between the release that you say flowed from the 1986 order and the releases that were obtained with the $400 million?                 So, specifically what was not included in the 1986 release that was included as a result of the settlement negotiations?                 But I would like to know the difference.   What would -- what would Travelers be liable for under the 1986 order as you read it, that they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?               So then -- so that the 2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic accidents?               I have one question before you reserve the rest of your time.                 That is, you said this is -- this is a sweeping release that Travelers got in settlement for the claims of many parties.     But some people were not there and those are the people who still want to bring their claims.               I haven't asked my question.               I would like to know what -- what notice did the people who were left out of the settlement, who were not part of the settlement, who say, so we want our day in court -- what notice did they have and what opportunity to be heard?              How can it be successive when they didn't even get their -- I mean they -- these people haven't had a day in court.                  They may have a claim that's no good.       All State courts so far have said their claim is no good.         But they have a right --                The rule -- the particular rule that I am asking you about is that people who have not had their day in court can be precluded --                -- on the basis of newspaper notice and radio announcements?                That was the best possible notice, which included regular mail notice.                That was the dissenting opinion.                 But there are two decisions of this Court, Abcam and Ortiz, that reject that position.
08-304 +++$+++              And it's also the original source, if -- if the relator is the original source of the information.             But what about the argument that Congress wanted to, in its most recent provisions, wanted to expand qui tam availability and this would -- if you would -- if you include State and local reports, that will shrink the availability?              When you say "twice," you mean in the first clause that says "in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing"?              But there is a redundancy there if the statute means what you say it does; it says "administrative hearing" in both the first clause and the second clause.             Is this particular audit report we are talking about, this is the audit report was done by an independent accountant?                 Is that --              Is that -- is that audit on file with the Department of Agriculture?
08-305 +++$+++                Mr. Feinerman, but the -- the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a free appropriate public education available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in private school.   But that "if" -- if the agency made a free appropriate public education -- and here, as I understand it, the school district said that this child was ineligible for special education.              So if the child was entitled to a free appropriate public education and didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?              Well, that's your --               That's your construction. But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if -- the word is "if" -- the agency, not -- so the implication is if the agency did not make a free appropriate public education available, then --               Then -- then what happens in a case which I think is like this one, where the child doesn't receive special education because the school has determined that the child is not eligible? So the child isn't getting public education, and in the parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in need of special education, can't get it from the public schools, because they declared the child ineligible. What is such a parent to do?               But if you can explain what the process is --              -- because Justice Scalia said the parents just went away.               The school at an earlier point said this child was ineligible for special education, isn't that so?          I think --              Yes.              Is that hearing --              Is that hearing on eligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?                When the school said not eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first before we ever get to the IEP?                Well, wouldn't the school say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until the question of eligibility is determined?              The IEP -- they did the IEP after the hearing officer was finished?              Isn't it also plausible that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial for this system, this is a child with severe learning disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need ten months?                  How have -- how have hearing officers been proceeding?                  I mean, here we had a case that went to a hearing officer.                      There is no IEP when the hearing officer begins the process.                      In the -- on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give deference to the school district and then -- so that's eligibility.   At the IEP stage, do they give deference to the student?                  No, the hearing officer. The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker. And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the child is eligible.      That's the threshold determination. On that threshold determination of eligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the school district?                Where are you reading this?
08-310 +++$+++                  There are other vessels, too.   It's the -- it's the oil tankers, and there are a few other vessels that were included?               How many days.               And you don't dispute that in light of the benefits provided by Valdez to the shipowners, that they could be a legitimate tax on these vessels?               So could you describe what tax authority you think Valdez has?               How much property -- you said if they -- if they taxed all moveables, that would be okay.    Could they have some exemptions and still --              But that's -- the train is going to be some place throughout its trip, unlike the ship that's going to be on the high seas.                Who can tax for the time on the high seas?                And the domicile here is Texas.   Is that right?                In either case, no ships berth in either Delaware or Texas.                  Is that right?                So the home port might have had in the old days the notion that's really where the vessel is berthed.       But, nowadays, Delaware has very little to do with where the vessels are berthing and where they are being serviced?
08-322 +++$+++              Bailout wasn't involved in those cases.    And what do you do with a statute that has three categories -- the State, political subdivision, and then there's "governmental unit"?                 The district qualifies as a governmental unit.                 Why would Congress add that third category if the district came within "political subdivision"?             Yes, but the -- but the statute does use the term "governmental unit" to encompass districts.       And if they were also subdivisions, why would Congress need to add an additional category?              It appears in the statute twice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three categories.                 There is -- the district court had some assistance from the legislative development of this latest extension.                    There was a proposal, was there not, to allow governmental units to bail out -- to allow anyone who was required to preclear to bail out?                 And what was the reason that it was resisted?              The Department of Justice has -- does it -- does it not have a regulation that contradicts your reading?        And hasn't that been out there -- wasn't it out there before the 2006 extension?              What was the last time the district applied for preclearance, the last year?              And so 2004 is the last year.   So between 2004 and 2009 the district has not sought preclearance?             You don't challenge -- if you have bailout, say we accept your reading of the statute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of the act if it matched your obligation to preclear with the right to bail out.                But I -- I thought I just heard you say even if you got the bailout the extension for another 25 years would still be unconstitutional. Is that -- or are you saying that the accommodation, the modification, would suffice to make the statute constitutional?             But there was -- but there was -- Congress fastened on that issue and it referred to second generation discrimination, which is a frequent pattern with discrimination.                  You start with the blatant overt discrimination, and then in time people recognize that that's -- that won't go any more, so the discrimination becomes more subtle, less easy to smoke out.   But it doesn't go from blatant overt discrimination to everything is equal.              But if you take the multiple devices -- take the one as simple as moving the election day so that it will coincide with the -- with the holiday of a predominantly minority college.               To go after every change of that order with a section 2 lawsuit -- of the two devices, surely section 5 is more effective to smoke that out.               Perhaps they -- perhaps they wouldn't if the only tool in the arsenal were section 2, if everything had to be a Federal lawsuit.             What kind of coverage formula would be adequate?           You are attacking Congress' preservation of the same coverage formula.              But what other coverage formula could it come up with?             There was -- and maybe the government will refer to it -- I thought, quite a bit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this record.             Well, you said all that there was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think there was quite a bit more than that.             In your -- in your answer you said if they used the 2004 the only State would be Hawaii.    But I asked you what formula would pass if Congress wants to get at -- wants to protect the gains that have been made but are still fragile against backsliding?     If that's its objective, what can it cover?               Well, this Court said -- -- it was not 1982, it was two thousand something.                This Court thought from two thousand something 25 years was a reasonable period.              The district will -- the district will never be involved in racial bloc voting for districting purposes because it doesn't -- it's boundaries don't change.              Why wouldn't one construing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well, Congress obviously had in mind that this would be enforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw, this Court's decision in Miller?
08-351 +++$+++                 Mr. Castiglione, you have been asked to address the mootness question -- both counsel.              Have forfeiture proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases?             Is there any lingering question concerning the status of the property?              Have concluded?             There were no damage claims when the final judgment was entered in the district court?             So it was a final judgment, and it went up on appeal.             And at what point did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the case, there was nothing for the district judge to do.             But --               They did not ask for damages originally.               So as the case comes to us, we have a district court final judgment dismissing the case.   The case was only for injunctive relief.                    It goes to the Seventh Circuit.              It's in that shape.      We are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit.               If it been there originally, but the problem is it wasn't there.              The case comes to us on a complaint that is simply for injunctive relief.   And that is moot.             And the plaintiffs -- the plaintiffs didn't appeal the denial of certification.             Well, maybe we should -- we should ask the plaintiffs about that.            But you're saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not moot?   Isn't a default the end of it?             You said in your opening that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the petition for forfeiture.      But in your brief you suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs could get back their property pending the ultimate forfeiture proceeding.     You mentioned a Slocum type hearing, a petition for return of their property.              So I don't understand your argument that there's one and only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the other hand you are telling us that there is a means.               How do you get an expedited hearing?      I thought -- I thought for property under 20,000, the State -- the time before the forfeiture proceeding could be 187 days.               And the bond is for costs, not to get your car back.              Is there -- is there any procedure for putting up a bond for the car so you can get the car back, for the full value of the car?               There is no -- there s no hardship under the Illinois statute?                 There is no provision comparable to the Federal legislation for hardship, is there?
08-441 +++$+++                Is there a variety of views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant by the term "direct evidence"?               It wasn't defined in Price Waterhouse either.               So there is a range of views on what it means, starting from direct versus circumstantial, to something like strong evidence.              And it was the view of only one justice, Justice O'Connor alone.                She did make the fifth vote, but no one else accepted a direct evidence test.              Well, would you urge that we should count Justice white's decision as the controlling decision rather than Justice O'Connor's?               But, Mr. Schnapper, there is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your case -- between what is called the prima facia case that the plaintiff would make under the MCDonnell Douglas test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor. I think you must concede that in order to fit within this double motive frame you must show not simply a prima facia case, but by a preponderance of the evidence that the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.                Can -- can one know if you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury? That is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown whether you have established by a preponderance of the evidence that age discrimination was a motivating factor.               Couldn't -- couldn't any Title VII case be presented in either framework?
08-453 +++$+++                But to some extent, would you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the attorney general under New York's law, but the superintendent of banks as well, has authority over mortgage lending?     Would -- would you agree that the part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could not be enforced against national banks?               But there is -- the provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?              Just with respect to the same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern about racial discrimination?              Anything?     And you agree to that?              Even if the New York statute --                May we clarify one thing about the 50 jurisdictions?              The attorney general from New York is not asserting authority over bank lending in Hawaii.   So for each institution, I assume it's going to be two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney general, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank with respect to particular loans?               But we come to the New York Attorney General.      I see your argument that there's a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys general okay, but no public attorney general.                But on the other hand, the attorney general starts out by asking for bank books and records.                And high on the list of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the bank's books and records. So why isn't that -- his preliminary investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the visitorial power bundle?
08-472 +++$+++                  General Kagan, just as a factual matter, is there any other national memorial that consists of a solitary cross, just that one symbol and no other?               Well, I was just curious as a factual matter whether this lone cross, if -- if there was any other memorial like that, and your answer is no, but there could be other religiously oriented memorials?              Is the -- is the private property owner who has this designation free to destroy it after it's been designated a national memorial?              Could they then substitute whatever other memorial they chose?              Or would there have to be some government approval?              But it wouldn't automatically require acquire a national memorial status, would it, when the government hasn't seen it, hasn't -- I thought that to get national memorial status, the government has to approve what you put up.              I thought the Respondents asked to have the injunction enforced.                It is typical, you get an injunction -- and I'm glad that the government has recognized that that was indeed a final decision because you appealed it to the Ninth Circuit under 1291 as a final decision.             Then the question is, are you complying with the injunction.                One side says, the winner -- who by the way has unquestioned standing to enforce the injunction that is now final that that party obtained -- the winner says:                  Court, please enforce the injunction.         They are not asking for a new injunction.     They say this injunction, as Justice Breyer just explained, says, do not permit the cross.                  The party comes in and says:          Here's my injunction; court, all I want you to do is enforce it.              Do you know, General Kagan, any case in which there has been a permanent injunction ordered, final, no more appeals are possible, where -- and standing was in question, raised, litigated, and decided, and then when the party who won the injunction comes to the court and says, court, please enforce the injunction, that you can say, now we can go back to square one and argue again about standing?   I don't see how you can revive what has been determined by a final judgment.              Well, we know it isn't that because, as I think you pointed out, the same docket number.   This wasn't a new complaint.           This was a motion to enforce the judgment.              Yes, but the standing issue was independently important to the government, because the government can face this kind of question again, and if you right -- if you were right on the standing point -- I mean, I don't understand why the government would not have had a strong incentive to say, we want to get rid of these cases on the standing ground, we think the Court was wrong on standing. But in any case, you didn't do that, and I think that you started your argument this morning in the right place when you said, let's talk about this law. Congress said, accepting arguendo that the Court was right, here's a law that cures the constitutional defect.   And that's where you were -- that's where you started your argument.         Maybe you can pick up with that. But --             Who would see it, General Kagan?   Who would see it?        I mean, the Seventh Circuit case, it was -- it was on level ground, lots of people used the area, and I think the Seventh Circuit required a fence and a sign.      But here, this cross is high on a cliff in a desolate area.         And if you had a little sign, who would be -- you would have to climb up to it.
08-479 +++$+++                Was there --                 Was there prior experience in this particular school?                    Were there prior occasions on which students had been strip-searched and contraband found?                 But you -- I thought your answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the school's experience, children do hide contraband in their underwear but not in their body cavities.              What was --              What was -- what was the drug involved in that case?              But it certainly was not ibuprofen?               You said it was a prescription drug.               Yes, but he -- he was not the one who identified Redding.                It was her classmate.               And on that classmate's say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did you get this pill?      Where did she give it to you?               I mean, what place.    I mean, the child is caught with the pills.                 She blames it on her classmate.     She says:           She gave them to me.     Did the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave them, where in location she gave them?               But it's contemporaneous with the -- with the student who blamed the other child. I'm asking if there's any link other than one child caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone else?   The tip from the young man had nothing to do with Redding; it had to do with Glines.               Maybe it becomes reliable as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.                In the case, this case, the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school nurse and she identified what they were.                But there has to be -- I mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search, was there was a teacher said:             I caught those girls; they were smoking in the bathroom.                 Here we have nothing but this Glines identifying her classmate.                And nothing is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow up on it at all.   And the search is quite different from the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's person.                But an official could follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is a basis for what she said.          But there were no questions asked at all.              There's one aspect of this considering the reasonableness of the school administrator's behavior.           In addition to not following up with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice principal's office for over 2 hours and her mother wasn't called.    What was the reason for that humiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?                 But how were they investigating her when they did nothing but put her in a chair outside the vice principal's office?              What would be, Mr. O'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim?                    That would be against the school district?              What would the plaintiff have to show to establish a claim under Monell?              Yes, there would. There's a Monell claim against the school district because there is no qualified immunity.              Yes.
08-495 +++$+++               In this --              In this case, how many of the defendants were alien?            You're -- the jury is given a charge that covers all of the defendants.                     They're all charged with the same crime.             How many of them were aliens?              Then the judge wouldn't distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for the defendants who were not aliens because it would have no consequences for them.           So why should the judge -- even if the question could be asked, why should the judge -- the judge takes a position:                     It's not an element of the crime.        Therefore, I'm not going to charge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by saying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to find the amount.               But before you go on to that, we're talking about (M)(i).                It's coupled with another provision that's an offense that is described in section 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion -- in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds 10,000.   So it's the same "in which" construction, and there's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax evasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency.               A deficiency, but not the amount of the deficiency.               But is the amount -- there's a deficiency.        The jury has to find in order to find tax evasion there is a deficiency.                    Does it have to find that the revenue loss to the government exceeds $10,000?               But the problem is that there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter made.   If we take your position that there are a number of statutes that mention amount, some as an element, some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you have these unequal results within the Federal system and in the States, so when you think -- would it make any sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if the State happens to make -- to have the "in which" or if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?               But it's treating people who do the identical thing differently.               But what you're saying is you're not denying that people who commit the identical theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently depending on whether the statute under which they're convicted has this "in which" clause?               Can we go back to my question, which I don't think you've fully answered? And that's the tax evasion situation.                     For any tax -- a person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial and is convicted, that person would not be deportable, as I understand it under your reading, because the jury is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.               I know.       You told me that most of them admit it at the plea stage.                    But going to trial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me they are meant to operate the same way.
08-5274 +++$+++               Mr. Forster, there are three levels under this:         Possession, brandishing, and if the gun is discharged.          You don't quarrel with the notion that Dean at least brandished this gun?               So we're talking about a three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun is discharged?                But it doesn't say -- it says, "if the gun is discharged."                 And I think on the government's reading it would cover the police officer who is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun.                 But it's the police officer who snatches the gun.                 So it's using the robber's gun, but by the police officer who is apprehending him.    In other words, as I understand the government's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the police officer.   It has to be the gun of the robber, but it doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police officer who discharges it.                  It has very specific -- what are the words that define what is brandishing?                 I -- I didn't think the government or anybody was reading the definition of brandishing to include a police officer.                 Right.              Isn't it part of the background here that it was proposed at the time these enhancements came into the law, it was proposed that there be a specific state of mind requirement for the discharge of the gun, and that was not enacted?                  I thought that part of the legislative history was that there were proposals -- I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between "possess" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent element -- "brandishing," very clear, for purposes of intimidation -- then "discharge" has no -- it's just that the gun is discharged. Weren't there proposals to include something like what was included for the other two, that is, that there be an intent requirement?                Well, there's accidents and accidents.    And couldn't one say, looking at this that, well, we will -- the State will find that the culpability that we will attribute to this statute is reckless?   If recklessness were the requirement certainly the facts in this case would fit, would they not?                You accept that --                You say reckless is not enough, it has to be knowing.              This is not a mere accident.   It's -- this -- the gun was loaded, it wasn't locked, and he's raking in money with one hand, holding the gun with the other.         The teller is crouching down. I mean, there was -- there was a pretty substantial risk of something going wrong, right?               The -- the "use or carry" certainly has to be in relation -- during and in relation to, but that's step one.                So he already is using and carrying or carrying in relation to the bank robbery.   And then -- so that's the starting premise. That excludes all your things about years before or years after he carried -- he carried a gun.                    You -- step one narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun in connection with a bank robbery.                Why -- you say that this background -- that there has to be a state of mind element.   And we can accept that that's a general principle, but here we have a provision that does require a state of mind -- specifically requires a state of mind for the possession, for the brandishing, intent to intimidate, but here is this other one that suddenly doesn't.     So wouldn't the text of this statute say -- the third one, discharging a gun, they didn't mean to have any element because -- any element of mens rea -- because they had it in number 1 and 2, and 3 leaves it out.
08-538 +++$+++              Mr. Goldblatt, I thought that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C, property claimed as exempt.            She lists, as property claimed as exempt, "See attached list of business equipment."     And then we have an inventory going for several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen equipment.    And that's what she says is the property claimed as exempt.            But she -- in her inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that those numbers will cover all of her business equipment.            Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt, this is -- this is really my concern.              It seems what she wants is her cooking equipment, not the money equivalent.    And if the trustee had objected, she could have said:    Well, if they think that this cooking equipment is worth more than the value that I put down, I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the dollar -- dollars for it.            Then you're going through all the administrative expenses of having an auction where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be like amending your pleading.            And she was so -- so upset, she said:        I'll get out of the bankruptcy; I want my cooking equipment.            It was very clear that that's what the debtor wanted.            The question is whether -- the question is whether the trustee had to make an objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it.              Well, then she has -- on your reading, her claim is improper because she's claiming more than she's entitled to.              If her claim is improper, then the trustee has an obligation to object to it.               Can you -- can you -- that was -- what you've just said, no requirement that the trustee object to valuation, one of the briefs -- it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page 27 -- said "Challenges to valuation are the most common types of objections to exemptions."            My concern is keeping it simple, giving fair notice to people.              She's got the same amount under exempt -- the last two columns.                 A rule is proposed.   It says when the two columns have the same amount, that's a clue to the trustee that the debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular property.   That's a nice, simple rule.              It tells the trustee when he has to object, and the end of the matter.              But it's not in kind in the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.              She is contending that she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an auction.              Then -- then her claim is wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee should have made an objection.               If it's not the asset itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring.                 But Congress -- this is a peculiar list it has.                 It has personal jewelry, tools of trade.             It sounds like -- even though those have a dollar cap, it sounds like Congress said these are the kinds of things a debtor would want to keep in kind.             What she did do, she said:   That unsettles me so much that I'm going to withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond anything, I want to keep that -- that property.             But the -- but the Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying: And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an auction.            What she could have done is trimmed some items from the list.            That's much less informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she has one list that s showing what she paid for it.            She makes her best guess.       It's -- you're suggesting that she would be entitled to the notice if she put down "unknown," "value unknown" or "value 100 percent." So your -- on your theory, in order to do what she obviously wants to do, preserve her kitchen equipment, she has to give no information or inaccurate information. If she said -- I think what you're saying is if she said a 100 percent, instead of saying what she thought was the -- the value, or if she said unknown, she would be entitled to notice from -- to an objection from the trustee.     But because she has tried her best to put down what the form calls for, she doesn't get any objection from the trustee.              Would she --
08-586 +++$+++               But there was in this record, was there not, a submission by the adviser comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what institutional funds were charged, but explaining the differential in terms of the services provided, that more services were provided to the fund and less services were provided to the institutional investors.              Who would have the burden?   You said that is an issue that has not been decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for remand.   Who -- would you have the burden if they came forward and said, look, this is what our situation is. These are the services.       Would you have the burden to show that in fact they were comparable and the differences did not warrant the differences in the fee?             You would have the burden?             Has it filed any?                Mr. Gannon, the -- all the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's Gartenberg case?                But in -- in that case, at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what institutional investors are paid.
08-598 +++$+++               But they all agreed that he was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator. They all agreed to that.         But assuming you're right on issue preclusion, what more -- the State says, yes, we recognize "mental retardation" means you can't administer the death penalty.             But what would the State show at an Atkins hearing that is not already in the record of this case?      I mean why do it again?              May I ask how it worked pre-Atkins when mental retardation was a mitigator?               We are told that the appellate courts independently reviewed.   We have a finding at the trial level that, yes, there is a mitigator mental retardation, but it doesn't overcome the aggravator, so the jury comes in with a death sentence. Then at the appellate level, is there a continuing adversary contest about whether retardation exists and, therefore, is a mitigator, or is it just the -- the judge, the appellate judge, looking over the record that has been made at trial?               So -- so that the prosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for them to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be that mitigator?               If they didn't make a finding on mental retardation, how -- how could the appellate court determine that it was a mitigator but overwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge charge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?               First go back to the jury.    How do we know that the jury found mental retardation as a mitigator?
08-6 +++$+++                Performance we should let the -- let Osborne, Osborne's attorney, address that question, because you're not really equipped to answer for the other side.               There was evidence in -- at his trial at the state of the art at that time. There was whatever the test was.               But when did the current technology become available?               When did the testing that he now requests --              Would you explain that --              Just to clarify his statement, he said that the State of Alaska provides a means for him to get at this information; but if it did, I think we wouldn't be here.            So would you -- Alaska is one of the few States that has no statute.              So what -- you say -- this whole controversy is whether the State is obliged to give him this information; but you're saying it's simply that he picked the wrong procedure.                That's what I thought I heard you say just now; that there is a means under Alaska law where he could get this DNA postconviction.   So would you please explain what the Alaska procedure is?              Has there been any case in Alaska where a defendant postconviction was, in fact, able to get DNA testing under the procedure you just described?                 But you said something significant.   You said that he would have to allege his actual innocence, which he hasn't done.                      So if he continues not to -- not to put in a sworn statement that, I am actually innocent, under your current procedure he still couldn't get the DNA.                 You gave the one case in which in the habeas in Alaska the court granted access to DNA, but the evidence wasn't there. On how many occasions when postconviction someone moved for the DNA evidence did the Alaska courts deny the request?               Well, you told us it was granted in one case.       What happened in the other six?                What were the two confessions?   I know the one before the parole authorities.   What was the other one?               How about --               But you -- you referred to the civil rules, and in discovery, in criminal cases as in civil cases, it -- ordinarily you have to prove that you have a basis for a claim.                   Like you don't get on the civil side discovery before you can pass the 12(b)(6) threshold that you have stated a claim. Are you giving that up here?                  Because he's seeking the discovery but he hasn't established that he has a tenable claim.
08-604 +++$+++              But you didn't contest it in two.   Two cases, you concede that there was in fact a conference.             Yes, but the board can make rules of procedure.         It can't make rules of jurisdiction.    The dismissal of all these petitions was for want of jurisdiction. Now, if the board has no authority to set its jurisdiction -- and I think that's plain; Congress has that authority, not the board -- then it is required to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress gave it.               So why isn't that the very first question that this Court should deal with? The board threw these cases out for want of jurisdiction.   Whatever the failing was, it was not and could not be jurisdictional because the board has no authority to describe its own jurisdiction.                 So you say this is just a mistaken use of words, rather than -- than the board saying, under our rules, we don't have power to handle this?               Do you -- do you dispute what your opponent tells us, that some panels of the board, even when there has been no conference, let alone no proof of a conference, but some panels have stayed proceedings to allow the conference to occur, and then the board will pick up?              I am looking at the decision and they are all identical in this respect. The board said it has no jurisdiction to consider any of the remaining procedural or substantive issues associated with this claim. "No jurisdiction," that sounds like they are saying:   We have no authority to consider anything about this case; we must toss it out because there is no proof of the conference.              And it's going against another panel that says, not only you don't have to have the proof, even if you didn't have the conference we are not going to throw you out. Now, there is different panels, but it is the same board.   Why shouldn't the grievants here say, we don't understand this?         It's conceded there was a conference, at least in two of the cases.                     Our buddies didn't even have a conference and this same board, a different panel, allowed them to cure it.                     And I can't cure it now.   That is the height of arbitrary behavior by the board, it seems to me.              I'm not -- I'm not talking about due process.          I'm talking about conformity with the act, the act's requirement.                   I --             So does the board as a whole apparently, because I am looking at the instruction about joint exhibits and it tells the parties, when you are going to make a submission don't include unnecessary documents, and among things don't include things that aren't in dispute --             -- like letters requesting conferences.              Then the board is telling people, I will go back a sentence:                "Representatives may wish to omit documents that are unimportant and/or irrelevant to the disposition of the dispute." I mean that -- that seems to me is trapping people, if the board says, please don't dump on us unnecessary paper.             Then if -- then a person following this is obliged not to pay heed to this advice because if you don't put in every document, if you don't put in enough evidence of conferencing, you are going to be out and never have your grievance heard.             They are not relying on it as applicable in this case.              They are relying on it as the board's indication that it's sound to tell the parties, don't dump on us unnecessary paper.             Some panels of the board. Other panels think this is an eminently curable defect.             That's a decision on the merits.    Here we are talking about a threshold barrier to even get your case heard.             And that is being decided differently by different panels.              And in two cases you concede that that condition was met, that there was a conference?              So we are not even talking about a conference requirement.                    We are talking about a pleading rule, how you plead.                    Everybody concedes that the conference occurred in two cases.              It's how you plead that.
08-6261 +++$+++                  Is this law unique to the District or do other States -- I mean, the problem that they are trying to get a handle on is domestic violence. And the prosecutors are busy prosecuting drug crimes and the rest.     So the District's solution is, we will allow the abused person to initiate this criminal contempt. Are there other States that have the same procedure?               I -- I mean, however you describe it in practical terms, are there other places that say, abused person, you can initiate this and you can have your lawyer present it, whether it's on behalf of the State or -- but just the practical of how you go through the motions; are there other States that allow the victim?               Well, we can ask the government.
08-645 +++$+++              You would be on absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment, but it's not.    You -- you said the whole question is deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but this statute is not raised in terms of court jurisdiction.    It's in terms of the right of a custodial parent.             You re not relying on the order; you re just relying on the statute?             What happens to the woman who, now she has abducted the child to Texas, and she says to the Texas court:        If you send me back, I am going to be beaten by this man who has a history of being a batterer?             You are saying that the court -- the court that s asked to give effect to the convention is helpless, that it's automatic that if there is a custody right, the court in the state to which the child has been taken must order that the child be returned?             Do you know --             Ms. Howe, wasn't the -- the problem that gave rise to this Abduction Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer brought up?   That is, the parent that has visitation rights snatches the child, takes it to that parent's home country, and then you are relying on only the court order.    That's why we have the Hague Convention on the Abduction of Children. It wasn't for the -- I mean, this -- this case is not the usual case.           The usual case is the noncustodial parent takes the child out of the country where the custodial parent lives.              And, internationally, there was a huge problem of getting the child back, and that's why we have the Hague Convention on Abduction, because courts weren't enforcing foreign court orders.             Well, what is the -- what is the significance of their breaking down the two categories?   One is the rights of custody, and the other is rights of access. Because I take it that under your view of the Chilean law, given that the noncustodial parent will always have this right to block taking the child out of the country, then there's really no difference between the two categories, because every, say, father with the right of access -- not custody, just access -- would automatically by virtue of the law of Chile have this one custodial right; that is, to block taking the child out of the country.          You don't question what the representative of the mother has said in this case, that the emphasis -- when this Hague Convention was before Congress, the emphasis was on the custodial parent -- that is, the person in the situation of the mother here -- that what Congress was told was the urgent problem was the noncustodial parent taking the child away from the custodial parent.            That was the -- the major thing that drove this convention and that's what the State Department told Congress; isn't that so?
08-651 +++$+++             How do you decide which of the many consequences your rule would cover?           I mean, you are now talking about a narrow ground, misadvice. But you are also urging that when the lawyer is silent on a matter that he should inform the defendant, that, too, is covered. But whichever way you do it, how do you -- you say certainly deportation is a consequence that the defendant should be told about. What about -- how do you distinguish that from, say, you'll lose your driver's license, you'll lose your right to vote?     How do we distinguish the consequences that count and those that don't?              But even -- even if we accept that, wouldn't a competent counsel, after telling him the deportation consequences, then say:               But this is a case where the evidence is so strong against you, I advise you to take the plea rather than go to trial.                  If you go to trial, you are likely to lose and you will get a longer sentence.    So does it matter in the end if competent counsel would have said, this is a good plea, take it?               You were about to say that in many States the trial judge does inform a defendant who is an alien of immigration consequences.             And that would be what in this case?
08-660 +++$+++                  Why at the start?         Why isn't the time the end, when we can -- the notice of appeal is to be filed after there is a judgment.                     Why isn't the proper time to determine number of days to appeal when the judgment is entered?                     And at that point, one can see that the government has done nothing, absolutely nothing in the case. At the inception, I agree with you, we don't know what, if anything, the government is going to do. But by the time judgment is entered, we surely know.               But we hear the government did nothing, not one thing.               The test is -- I don't know what you mean by "active participation" as opposed to just plain participation.           If the rule is at the time judgment is entered to determine how much time you have to file your notice of appeal, the question is, has the government done anything?         And if the government has done nothing at all, then you have 30 days.              Is there any advantage? I mean, a notice of appeal is the easiest document, so it's not a question that there's any labor involved in doing this.    But is there any advantage to filing -- to taking the 60 days instead of the 30 days?               Why would counsel want to take advantage of the extra 30 days?                 It isn't a question of a labor, having to write, like having to write a brief.          What advantage would there be to taking the additional 30 days?              How would the -- how would you know at the time of filing of the notice of appeal whether the government is thereafter going to file an amicus brief?               The government is not saying it doesn't need the 60 days.                       It's saying you don't qualify for the 60 days, you are not the government.    I don't think the government is arguing that its own time can be shortened.              Can the government appeal without having intervened in the district court?               Do you think that everyone -- you are relying on the government, that the government is in the caption and it's a real party in interest.   Is every real party in interest a party for this purpose?               There is something odd about -- plaintiffs come to the court seeking something. Defendants are -- are stuck.           They're being sued.      And here the United States is an involuntary plaintiff.                  It didn't commence this lawsuit, and I think there must be many cases where the government will say, we don't want anything to do with this.
08-661 +++$+++             Does that cover everything that the NFLA does?            Because everything is subject to agreement.       It's all concerted action.       So, is everything under the Sherman Act, and then it goes to rule of reason analysis?            Or are there some things that escape, entirely, antitrust analysis?          Mr. Nager, I think you answered my question originally:             Yes, everything. Because they are separate entities, they agree on everything.     There s agreement in every case.          So there s nothing that you would take outside, and you put everything under the rule of reason analysis.          One -- one concern in the litigation is, you know, if it doesn't come under the Sherman Act at all, they go home after the case is dismissed on the -- on the pleadings. But once you say no, it's got to be a rule of reason analysis, then you have discovery, which can be costly.     And I thought that that was a feature of this case, that the -- that the plaintiff wanted more discovery, and the court said:            You've had enough.          Is your point that your client wasn't hurt until they dealt exclusively with one manufacturer?          So you have nothing -- you had no damages before?
08-67 +++$+++                But Ashe is quite a different case.     Ashe is a seriatim prosecution.                   It was one event, a robbery.        There were six victims.                Victim number one, the charge relating to victim number one, was an acquittal.     That necessarily decided that the defendant was not among the robbers.                      So that is quite a different situation from what we have here.              You're not contending that double jeopardy itself was at issue?                   In other words, claim preclusion.          There would be no claim preclusion, so we're talking only about issue preclusion?              That means it was necessarily, the issue was necessarily decided?                So the hung counts are equivalent, equivalent to an acquittal?
08-674 +++$+++             Mr. Lamken, you're not a challenger?            Yes.     I think --            -- the question relates to the other side --            -- not to his side --             Of course, there is. What's -- what s really lurking behind this case is whether this is a contract rate, and there FERC disagrees with you, I take it.           You were talking about that the rate that emerges from a contract between two people  - nobody else is party to it, but you say the rate stands; FERC cannot abrogate the rate; nobody can ask FERC to abrogate that bilateral contract rate.             But here we're not talking about a bilateral contract, where how many people were involved in the settlement?            Well over a hundred.             So that's quite a different picture than the bilateral contracts that were at issue in Sierra and Mobile.             The court of appeals never got to what FERC thinks is the heart of the case, whether this is a contract rate, whether -- you say it is not -- and whether FERC has the authority nonetheless to apply the public interest standard.                But none of those have been addressed by the D.C. Circuit.
08-678 +++$+++               Mr. Allen, you used a term before, and I think you were right in using it -- you said, "interlocutory review," but Cohen v. Beneficial is a narrow exception and it -- the theory is, it is a final judgment.               It's not interlocutory. And, nowadays, the courts have 1292(b). They can certify a question, if they think it's sufficiently important and they need an answer, without pretending that it's a final judgment in the case. So, given 1292(b), shouldn't we be particularly reluctant to extend Cohen v. Beneficial to include a case of a privilege that maybe was wrongfully denied?             And that's what 1292(b) was meant to deal with.                It's not -- it's not a rule of efficiency.      It's a firm final judgment rule that we have in the Federal system.                     And we are talking about a narrow exception.          The exception was first declared in Cohen v. Beneficial.                The question there was security for costs, yes or no?              Does that -- that is a pure question of law.       It doesn't depend on the variety of factual circumstances.          Attorney-client is quite different because it can often be fact-bound.                     It depends upon this particular case. Cohen v. Beneficial was meant for the kind of question that doesn't get you into the facts. Otherwise, once you get into -- once it's a fact-bound question, you are really eroding the final judgment rule.               But you are carving out an area, attorney-client privilege, as opposed to the kind of situation Cohen v. Beneficial dealt with. Here's a rule that a State has.                You have to put up security for costs before you go ahead with a class action.   The answer to that is either yes or no, that it either requires it or it doesn't require it.                      No facts at all.   You just have a class action, you need security for costs. Maybe this particular case doesn't involve many facts, but there will be attorney-client privileges cases, waiver cases that surely do.                      So we can't take that category, attorney-client privilege, and equate it to what was the kind of question at issue in Cohen.             Because those are cases that say your right is not to be tried, your right is not to be exposed to trial at all.              Mr. Allen, one of the purposes, one of the -- the underpinnings of Cohen v. Beneficial is that this kind of question is not going to come up very often, but attorney-client privilege, once you say that that's open to -- everything stops while you go to the court of appeals to get that.     And if you -- and if we hold the way you want us to, then a lawyer will be obligated every time she thinks that she has a valid claim to the privilege or that it hasn't been waived, she would be obligated to take an appeal which you are urging would be an appeal of right.              Is there any sensible line between an invocation of the privilege, denied, and a holding that the privilege has been waived?                   I know in your reply brief you -- you draw some kind of a distinction between waiver of the privilege and the existence of the privilege.           I didn't follow it.              There is another.            You are stressing the importance of the attorney-client relationship, the work of the attorney.                    Do you extend your position to work product?             It's not privileged.              But it's certainly -- it's certainly protected against disclosure.
08-680 +++$+++               But if the defendant goes home, he can contact a lawyer.               In prison he can't do that.     So, if the whole idea is to protect his right to counsel, then it makes a big difference whether he's at home or in prison.              In those cases, was there a considerable interval between --              It was just the break in custody?   A week --              -- was enough?              Suppose it's the same officer.    Does -- you said in your brief and just now it was a different officer.         Suppose it was the same officer?              Well, you could limit it to the same police department, the same investigation, so you are not covering the waterfront of every interrogation about any crime, any place.                In this -- in this case it's two years and seven months.                Why should the Court take that -- a period of that length and say, well, we are going to now rule for all future cases it should be, say, six months.
08-681 +++$+++                  How many years ago was the automatic stay eliminated?               When did this -- the current law come into effect?               How can that be?               When you say "equities," is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied for adjustment of his status, is that an equity?              It was changing conditions.              Alleged changing conditions.               That case -- this case could come out the same.         If we remand and we say that it's the traditional standards, this case might well come out the same way.       The -- the court might say, well, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it hasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.                  But the standard you think should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that describes as applicable to temporary injunctions.                      The word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay.                    The preliminary injunction standard.                 So the two words certainly overlap.
08-6925 +++$+++               And that's -- you say that's Federal law.      Would it make a difference if, contra what Florida held in the Hearns case, a State had typed a battery statute as a crime of violence?              No, no, no.      It's exactly the -- it's exactly the statute Florida has.                And somebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record what the conduct was.       But the State, unlike Florida, says, our battery statute for our State law purposes is a crime of violence; therefore, for our State law enhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery offense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of violence, if that's the State law.                Suppose we knew -- knew what happened.   It's the same statute, and it would be possible to have a conviction for a rude touching under it.   But this man, instead of pleading guilty, in fact went to trial, and we know that he beat somebody badly. If -- if that were the case, if we knew what the facts were, then would the ACCA enhancement be in order? The statute covers the waterfront from a rude touching to beating somebody to a bloody pulp.              But we know, because there's been a trial, exactly what this person does, and what he does would fall under the aggressive violence, capable of doing physical injury to another.             Would you just clarify an answer that you gave.       You described Florida as unique, but I thought there were many States that had a codification of common law battery that would include both touching and more aggressive behavior.                I thought Florida was not alone in having that kind of statute.
08-724 +++$+++               General Cordray, under the charge that was given, what happens if there is a juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances?                 Under Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty. But under the instruction that was given here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a failure of the jurors to agree on that question?              Yes.              It would be -- under the charge that was given in this case, you say it would be -- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the two life sentences.      It would not be a deadlock requiring a resentencing hearing.              General Cordray -              -- in reading that closing argument, it is disjointed.                    It goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that the defendant is getting.         I mean, it really is quite a stream of consciousness.        And what's remarkable about it is at no point did counsel say, give him a life sentence.   He said that either one would be acceptable, either death or life would be acceptable.
08-728 +++$+++              That would allow the prosecutor's time to be excluded, right?                     On your theory that it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the motion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of.                        So the prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and that would be included in the suspension period, right?             But I'm --             Yes.             But the clock -- the clock would run, on your theory, during the preparation time of the defendant.        It would not run during the preparation time of the prosecutor.                     So I don't think they are being treated the same.              Right.              No, no.       I'm talking about the prosecutor's answer to the defense motion.              One point that I would like you to clarify.       I -- I understand you to take the position that the interest of justice would be the route to take, where the judge would have to stop and make a finding.   In your view, would it be appropriate, assuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to send the case back, or is it too late, because the interest of justice finding was never made?              But you think it could be found.   If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by the judge, when is the latest time the judge could make the interest of justice filing?              So the result in your case would be that the case is dismissed, period.             That would certainly encourage judges who don't want to get involved with making findings, which you have to do to satisfy interest of justice, to just say:                Motion denied; I'm sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while you -- you are asking me for a favor.                    You want time to prepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime. Forget it.   You are not going to get the extension.             What must the judge -- the judge must make a finding orally or in writing.                  Can it just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest of justice?              Is -- is there any indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped during preparation time -- that there have been excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it, two circuits who go the other way?
08-7412 +++$+++               Are you urging that in all cases, including homicide cases?                Or are you drawing the line at homicide?              Is it a fact that --               That s the other case.             Is there any difference in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than otherwise?   I think you suggested in -- in your brief that educational and vocational training is not given to people who are in for life without parole because they will never be out on the street so they don't need to be transitioned back.             My question is, first, you say that they are not available.             Is that -- that s so?             So what are the terms of incarceration?     They just stay in their cells and  -            Is there -- is there disproportionality review generally in Florida and particularly for juvenile offenders?            Yes.             Yes, that's what I meant, whether you'd have to create a -- a procedure that does not exist in Florida for proportionality review.            But there is a problem with that argument in this case, because the sentencing judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as a recidivist, not as a first-time offender.           He said -- Graham got a very light sentence, just 12 months in detention and then 3 years' probation, and the judge said:   Now, you better toe the line or else you could be put away for a long time. And then he committed -- it really was  - the sentence was for the later activities, even though they weren't proved beyond a reasonable doubt.           I think that Graham admitted to a couple of -- to more armed robberies.   Isn't that so?
08-7621 +++$+++             Mr. Stevenson, there s a serious question before we get to the particulars of this case.    Justice Kennedy suggested it in the last argument.    This -- the time ran out for postconviction relief in 1993, and this petition is brought in 2007. There s a 2-year statute of limitations.               Florida said there s a procedural bar; we don't get to the merits of this case.            They said there's a question whether that means an illegal sentence, like the judge gave more than the maximum punishment.              Do you have any indication in Florida law that correcting a sentence any time overtakes the limitation on postconviction relief?            Let me -- let me --            But this judge said Yes, there s a Federal question in this case:            Does Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for juveniles?    He answered that question: no.          And then he said:    There is no other Federal question in the case; I do not reach the question that you are raising, that is, life without parole being cruel and unusual.              All -- the only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is, does Roper cover this case?           No.    Anything else is procedurally barred. What was wrong with that?            I thought -- I thought Simmons got life without parole.             I thought that Simmons's sentence was life without parole.            Then that would completely overtake the specific provision.             I mean, if you say the catchall illegal sentence, open to challenge at any time, then there s nothing left to the specific provision that says 2-year statute of limitations, unless three things.             But that would leave out Graham, then?     Your rule, you say under the age of 14, so you are distinguishing your case from Graham's?                   You are not saying all juveniles, just -- you are setting the line at 14?             Why not Thompson, where the line was 16?            What -- what about a homicide, a 13-year-old?             But you -- you are differentiating your position based on young age from Graham's counsel, who said for murder, even in the case of a youthful offender, life without parole is an appropriate -- is an available sentence?              I thought that in your cert petition, which I don't have with me, you raised the question of the adequate State ground in the second question.               But there was a question that you raised, and then your opening brief doesn't discuss it at all.     Your reply brief responds to the State and then brings up something in a footnote that the State doesn't have a chance to answer. That doesn't seem, to me, a very sound way to approach a question that you, yourself, raised.
08-769 +++$+++              Mr. Katyal, the Court summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and degradation. The Seventh Circuit said that that was a blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after purveyors who show these women in the shocking, degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily affirmed.               But what is a -- what is "and the like"?    How about cockfighting?              What is the difference between -- perhaps I missed something a few moments ago -- between bullfighting, cockfighting, dogfighting?    You say dogfighting is included, but bullfighting -- and I don't know where you put cockfighting.               But what about bullfighting?    Isn't that illegal in --               Can we -- have we finished with the category of fights?               What's the --                But it isn't -- it isn't -- illegal in Japan, and part of the video here were dog fights in Japan; legal where it occurred, no different from bull fighting.                But that wasn't --             Mr. Katyal, there is something quite different between Ferber, because the abuse of a child is occurring at the very time.                      As I understand it, Mr. Stevens was not a promoter of dog fights.     He was just filming them.               And so the -- the -- the simultaneous abuse of the child, it occurs only because the picture is being taken.                      The dog fight goes on whether Mr. Stevens is there with his camera or not.              Where it was legal for him to do that.              It even -- what I would like you to confront is that the very taking of the picture is the offense.         That's the abuse of the child. The abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is separate from the filming of it.                How many prosecutions have there been for crush videos?
08-810 +++$+++              Mr. Long, we re talking in the abstract --   -- referring to Scott, but -- that this case -- what I took away from the Second Circuit's opinion was the flaw here was not that the method was no good if you had adequate notice; the flaw was the people affected were not told in what is the language of ERISA, in plain, simple language, what their entitlement was.        And that's -- that's the problem, not that this method wasn't perfectly satisfactory if you gave everybody notice.          But the Second Circuit said, you didn't give them notice. Either it said nothing or it was totally ambiguous.             But if -- if there were information, but the -- the ERISA provision says that you are supposed to give the summary description of the plan  in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.             And all that the 1989 statement said was the amount the employees received may be reduced, if they previously left the company and received a distribution at that time.             But where is it -- what -- what was in the summary plan description on this point between 1980 and 1990, where is that?             Right.       So there was no description of this in the summary plan description?             So is it -- but what period?   Between 1980 and 1990 or the 3-month period -             -- you re talking about?             But you seem to be rearguing the -- I thought that the -- I thought that you had surrendered on -- what is it called?               Frommert I.   That -- that the Second Circuit said:              What you had was no good, because it violated the notice provision and it violated the anti-cutback provision. So that's what they call a phantom -- Right.             -- account. They call it phantom accounting.             It s out.     But you seem to now be telling us that was really a wrong decision on the Second Circuit's part, that there was -- that it was perfectly good, that it was described in the plan itself, although not in the summary plan description.             How does it -- how does it hurt the current employees?             You say they -- they don't get this --             So some kind of equal protection, that another worker will say: I didn't get that boon that my --             But there's no -- no -- nothing -- no deduction from the current workforce. They re getting what the plan said all along is the right calculation of benefits.             Mr. Long, would you -- would you explain your position on the picture we were given of these people who were rehired and -- and they get, periodically, a statement that says, you are going to get 2,000-some-odd dollars; and then, 5 years later, they get a statement that says, no, it's only $5.18, or something like that.             And not even about why -- why it was $5.   It's why did he get notices that gave him the perception he was going to get over 2,000 when it was so much less?
08-861 +++$+++             Why do you call it an independent regulatory agency?          I mean, Congress wanted it to be independent of the profession.               That much is clear.   It didn't want it to be independent of the SEC, so why are you characterizing it as an independent regulatory agency?              But the --              The SEC doesn't have another overseer.     I mean, the SEC is set up like the FCC, the other independent regulatory commissions, but this is a board that has a relationship with the SEC, where it can't do anything that doesn't have the SEC's approval.              It can't even issue a subpoena without the SEC's approval.            So the SEC really could stop anything?            What happened to the Petitioners here?    I think, if you were challenging what happened to the Petitioners here, certainly it would be a question of how you would have to do that.               You ordinarily go through the internal proceedings.               But here you are bringing a facial challenge and you say, never mind any particular proceedings; the whole thing is no good.              I thought that both sides --              I thought that both sides agreed that there is no statute, everybody agrees to that.   But I thought that the government, just as your side, agreed that the President could dismiss an SEC commissioner for cause.              Even though there's no statute that says anything either way.              For cause would be short of the 5-year term.              Does that mean, Mr. Carvin, that the SEC cannot appoint heads of -- heads of its divisions?     I assume that they would fit within the characterization "inferior officers."              So -- but if the SEC can't appoint --              Yes, so what are -- so what are the heads of the various divisions of the SEC?              Aren't there -- aren't there people within the independent regulatory commissions that have jobs comparable to people who are in the departments --              -- that the head of the department can appoint?       So who can appoint such people in the FEC, the FTC, the FCC, and so on?            So this whole thing would be constitutional if, instead of giving the appointing power to the commission, they had given it to the chairman?              Isn't that a highly unlikely scenario?   I mean, this thing won't work unless these two are working in harmony.            But there is -- there is -- it was working okay with the Stock Exchange.              It wasn't working okay with the accountants. And there s a problem.              There s a problem that Congress had to solve.        It wanted to tighten the oversight of the auditing function.             And they wanted to have people who were not beholden to the profession, but who were knowledgeable and could command high salaries to be doing this job.            How about if they -- would it work if the board members were proposed by the SEC, by SEC commissioners, subject to the approval of the President?     Would that be --             But the nominee would be -- by a nomination.     The names would be presented.             So, you --             You were -- I'm sorry, then.    I interrupted you, but I wanted you to give me your full picture of how this could be done, how Congress could accomplish its goal of having a strong, effective oversight body?            So it would be totally separate.     Then you would -- you d say it would have to be a totally separate independent regulatory agency.                    It could not be put under the wing of the SEC.            We don't know -- we don't know what's fictional and what is not here, because you came in, and you don't have a particular case.            Do you have another instance where Congress set up a scheme, and without having a particular case of an individual who has been hurt, you come in and say:       We might sometime be hurt by this, so we want the whole thing knocked down in the absence of any concrete case.            If we took away -- I mean, one big point was the double for-cause.               So let's say we have said that the SEC could fire board members, period.   Then that would remove the double for-cause. Would this statute then be constitutional?            So, it s not the double for -- the double for-cause isn't, in your judgment, what sinks this statute?
08-876 +++$+++               But it's not your -- it's not within your test, as I understand it.                   Your test is, there has to be economic harm to the person owed the duty of loyalty. Now, you could have a bribe or a kickback that will line the pockets of the person who takes it, doesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't harm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed. So it seems to me that the bribe and kickback, which I think is heartland MCNally, would not be included in yours.        It must be economic harm, actual or contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.             Where was that in the charge?             The charge -- the judge charged the jury in terms of Delaware law?
08-88 +++$+++                Ms. Rainville, underneath or between the lines there seems to be great discontent on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way the public defender system is operating.               And if we hold for you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right, the Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just the same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't it?               Did he get to offset it against the time for the pretrial incarceration?
08-905 +++$+++             But how could --            How -- how could that -- let's descend from the abstract to the concrete that is this case.     The story that was being put out is, yes, this drug may produce heart attacks, but there s no indication that it does so -- that the other drug that it's comparing with may have an anti-heart attack element.     And that's accepted.         We could -- it could be one explanation; it could be the other. How would the most diligent plaintiff have gone about finding out whether Merck really had no good faith belief in this so-called naproxen hypothesis?             But it didn't stop it. Didn't -- didn't Merck submit a curative label, whatever, and the FDA said that was okay?             And that -- that submission continued to give the naproxen hypothesis?    Not the -- the reason that we are seeing this heart attack thing showing up is that the other drug has a -- has a clotting inhibitor.             How when -- when there were -- doctors across the country were continuing to write prescriptions for this, when the market apparently accepted this -- it may be one thing, it may be another -- but there were not signals from the market itself, and the medical profession seemed to be going on and writing -- lots of doctors were writing prescriptions for this?             Very brief.             There was a brief drop, but it came right back up again.               Why not say that because of one -- one element of the claim is scienter, that there s no inquiry notice based on -- there may have been a misrepresentation, whether it was innocent or deliberate, we have no way of knowing.             Why not say because scienter is an element of the claim, and you can't get your foot in the door in the court unless you can plead that with particularity, that it's only when you have that indication that you have what you call inquiry notice?               But it's inquiry -- it's notice of what?     And -- the law is that one element that must be pleaded with particularity.             If you don't have that, you have no claim.             As long as the stock price was holding, how was the plaintiff injured?            If it's true that everything was locked up internally at Merck, all the reasonable diligence in the world would not have uncovered what eventually came out.
08-911 +++$+++               Two.    The -- the key word that is emphasized in this case is it's "under," instead of "in."              It would be clearer if it had said "in."              What was the --              Could you clarify, what is the provision about battered spouses?              I thought that that had to do with you could have more than one petition to reopen.              But the rule is you may reopen once and that -- that provision on battered spouses says, but if you are in that category, you can reopen again?                The ones that have been codified by statute -- those prior to the codification were by regulation.     Is that -- is that so?            Do we know where the motion -- where -- where did it originate?             Where did it -- it was -- we now know it's in the regulations.                It's in the statute.     But how did motions to reopen BIA decisions originate?            May I ask you, before you sit down:     Your response to the briefs that suggests that all of this is beside the point because this was a -- a second motion to reopen, and the statute allows only one?
08-9156 +++$+++               When did that come up?          I thought that the facts as the Eleventh Circuit presented them is that the senior lawyer first said:                     We want Dr. Kirkland's report not simply on the question of insanity and incompetence to stand trial, but also to give us leads to mitigating evidence. So mitigation is in his mind about looking into this mental question.           He reads Kirkland's report and, for whatever reason, decides this isn't worth pursuing; this is not going to help us. I thought that that's what the Eleventh Circuit said was the picture, that whether it was an incompetent, ineffective decision is a separate question, but as to what happened, why did the investigation stop, because the senior lawyer said: Yes, it's relevant to mitigation, but I looked at the report and I think it's not wise for us to pursue mitigation.              Where is that?   56?               I'm sorry that I don't have that appendix with me now, but as I recall the Eleventh Circuit was not making any independent determination of its own, but it was reporting what the senior lawyer -- his view of it.               They were not making a fact-finding as a tribunal.              That, what you said so far, leaves out one thing; that is, I thought that Dozier had said:    We need, we have to get this Kirkland report, and it's of interest to us for three purposes, the two that were relevant to the guilt phase and the one, mitigation, that was relevant to the penalty phase. That suggests that in his mind, in Dozier's mind from the start, was both phases, the guilt phase and with respect to mitigation.                And then he looked in the report and, having said, we should see if there's any leads to mitigation, then he next says, we're not going forward with this.              Now this case, for me at least, is terribly confusing, because I thought, reading the cert position, that the Court granted cert to deal with a legal question that has confused the lower courts, that is, what is the relationship between (d)(2) and (e)(1) of AEDPA?              Now I read your brief and I hear what you're saying so far.                It seems to be that you have a solid case under (d)(1); that is, that these counsel were ineffective because they did not pursue mental state mitigation. But that would be a much different -- that would be a fact-bound case tied to this record, as apart from the legal question:        What does unreasonable -- the (d)(2) unreasonableness, how does it relate to the (e)(1) presumed correct, clear and convincing evidence? I thought that that legal question was why we granted cert.              And that's -- that's what the Ninth Circuit position developed by Judge Kozinski.              The only problem with that, it would shrink the province of (e)(1) very considerably, because overwhelmingly Federal habeas petitioners do not get evidentiary hearings in Federal court. So, if we accept the Ninth Circuit's view of it, then (e) -- (e)(1) applies to a rather small category of cases; i.e., cases in which there is an evidentiary hearing in the Federal habeas proceeding.                 I'm -- I'm not talking about (d)(2) now.     We're talking about two provisions, trying to make sense how do they relate to each other.                 And one very well-presented position is the Ninth Circuit's in Judge Kozinski's opinion.      My only question is am I right to say that his view, which is your view, would leave very little work for (e)(1) to do if (e)(1) applies only when there's new evidence coming in; it's not just the -- the record that was made in the State court, but new evidence coming in in the Federal habeas.                 There are not -- not many cases.                 What you're saying is (d)(2) is a vigorous standard, but, yes, your description, unlike the opposing description of the relationship between these two --              -- does leave for (e)(1) this maybe 10 percent of the cases, not more.
08-964 +++$+++               But just so you would say tax avoidance methods are covered, just as the process here is covered.     So an estate plan, tax avoidance, how to resist a corporate takeover, how to choose a jury, all of those are patentable?             Isn't that the basis on which the patent law rests in Europe, in other countries?     They do not permit business method patents. It has to be tied to technology, to science or technology.    So if other systems are able to work with the notion of technology-based, why not ours?            But I was talking about -- you said that technology-based, that wouldn't work because there are so many definitions.             I'm simply asking you the question:       Does it work in these other systems?   That they -- they exclude business methods, they include technology-based innovations.
08-969 +++$+++               I thought the status of taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in Pasquantino.     There it was a question of alcohol taxes owed to Canada. There were taxes due, but not paid.            So why doesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property question that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as property?              Well, there are certainly differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case, either.     But why would the determination of what -- whether an amount owed to a government qualifies as property, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?              There was no assessment by Canada in the Pasquantino case.              They said the -- the defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.              But we're talking about -- only about property, not standing or anything else.   And in Pasquantino, the Court said that a scheme aimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it was entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud purposes.               It was injured because it couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who they were.   And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins Act, was to help States find the people who were evading the payment of the use tax on the cigarettes.                 Can you go back to the question I had asked you and was not finished getting your position on.     Jenkins requires report to the State. You say the city was not within the zone of interest. But from the point of view of the sellers, the out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would they really want not only to have the burden of sending a list of names to the State, but to every county and municipality?   Isn't it the -- just as it is in New York, there is a working relationship.                   The State gets all the names, and then it sends the names to the cities. You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only do you have to disclose to the State but also to any municipality that independently taxes cigarettes?                Is it -- we're told that New York City and New York State have a tax information- sharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share this information with the city.             How many people who buy cigarettes out of State come back to their home State and voluntarily pay the use tax?             But it needs the names so it can collect anything.         Otherwise, how is it -- how -- how would it ever know?             And they don't.                Do we know if these Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the State?
08-970 +++$+++             Mr. Cohen, I thought this judge, Judge Shoob, said:      These lawyers were amazingly good; I have never seen a better performance.           So don't we take him at his word?     I mean, he certainly talked about the quality of the performance of these lawyers.            Yes.             Mr. Cohen, you said in your brief that, in such a case, the prevailing party could argue that counsel should obtain a higher hourly rate in the litigation than the customary rate he or she charges in other cases, and that's the situation Justice Sotomayor inquired about. But that sounds to me -- you take the second-year associate, pay him at the rate of the top partner because her performance was so outstanding. That s an enhancement, but it isn't as transparent as the one that Judge Shoob gave. But you -- this suggestion -- maybe you are going to retreat from it -- that it would be appropriate to take the second-year associate and pay at a higher hourly rate than the customary rate for that associate.              But not necessarily  -              But we are going back to the judge, who did say that this was the best performance he ever saw.        So I can't credit just that it was just contingency. But, first, you have clarified that what you said in your brief meant only the top range for a lawyer of this, period.     So this is more limited than -- than one might take it to be. In some circuits, like the D.C. Circuit, the rate is set by the number of years that the person is out of law school, and there isn't any flexibility.                 I mean, you give the 1-year associate so much, the 5-year associate so much.     So how in a system like that could you take into account quality at all?            Is -- is there another example?    I mean, you -- you are saying the rule isn't never; it is sometimes.       And you have given us one sometime.     Is there any other illustration?            How about a downward adjustment?     You have the hourly rate, the number of hours, and the judge, after trimming the hours, then says:   This has been a case, even though they prevailed, the lawyer wasn't prepared; I am not going to give the hourly rate.     Can a judge adjust the lodestar down for poor performance?             Hensley is you lost on an issue, so you don't get paid for what you ve done.             But the plaintiff -- the plaintiff prevailed on everything.                 It s just that the judge said this was a really poor -- poor performance.
08-974 +++$+++             If it -- if it stopped using it, it might be vulnerable to a Rizzo-type suit from the people who were benefiting.            I thought in Ricci that was New Haven's position, that they thought that the test was unlawful because of the disparate impact.             How long does the City's exposure persist?     Let's say that the -- in the tenth round, someone is selected for the job from the qualified group.     And then there's a cutback, and there are going to be layoffs.        So the last hired is the first fired.   Could -- would there be a Title VII suit when that last hired is laid off, on the ground that if Chicago had done what it was supposed to do, this person would have had the job long ago and would be higher up on the seniority list?              I think you had a footnote in your reply brief that said that if your position prevails there would need to be an adjustment in the relief granted by the district court --              -- wasn t it?
08-992 +++$+++                  I didn't understand the Third Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy. I thought their position was -- the assertion was that the rule was mandatory; that is, if you are fugitives, you are out forever. But in fact, at the time that Kindler fled, the rule was discretionary, so the mandatory rule hadn't been firmly established.         That's what I thought the Third Circuit held.      It did not equate discretion with inadequacy.              But the fugitive- forfeiture rule that they were talking about was the -- the mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.             You mean that the defendant might not have escaped if he knew that the rule wasn't --              But the question that you present -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your brief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say:              "The court of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to compel a finding of inadequacy for any State procedural rule that permits the State courts to exercise a degree of discretion.    Any discretion is inadequate."            That's what you say the court of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to say:     Discretion, inadequate. Well, I'm looking first at the petition appendix page 62, which describes the district court's understanding, which the Third Circuit affirmed.               It says:   "An occasional act of grace by a State court in excusing or disregarding a State procedural rule does not render the rule inadequate to procedurally bar advancing a habeas claim in district court." Well, that's saying, yes, you can have a rule with discretion, not to follow the rule woodenly, and that doesn't make it inadequate.              Well, do you want to modify then what you said?          You said that the court of appeals said that any -- any degree of discretion means that the rule is inadequate.                 But what makes -- makes this particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule to the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell v. Burris said was not a tool.               In the -- in Campbell v. Burris, the Third Circuit said a State procedural rule can't be, cannot be rendered per se inadequate merely because it allows for some exercise of discretion.             Well, it would be really odd, considering that one member of the panel was on both cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same year, for at least that judge not to think that what he said in the one case was in no conflict with what he said in the other.
08-998 +++$+++                Which means -- which means what?    What is the consequence of that?               You concede that on the strict application of the 6 months she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to pay the creditors.      So what happens to her?              That's -- can you explain that?   It seems very odd.         It says she can do that if she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do.                   I mean, she's supposed to file that schedule.                 She's required, the statute says, to file it.                 But she gets an advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?               Moveable to where?          What -- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2 extraordinary months.       So now she's going to say: Court, please change the period.                 Change it to what? Anything she wants?              But you already told us that there could be a deviation through this 101(10A)(ii).   And why, if that was all that needed to be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say, bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this provision and we will get another period that doesn't have those 2 months with the extraordinary income?              Well, it could have been suggested to the debtor:         You can accomplish what you want by using this provision.                 But let me just stop you there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and to Justice Scalia doesn't fit.                Chief -- you can not - the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan was she has to pay over $1,000 a month, because she could never do that.    So you are not going to get that confirmed plan which could be amended later.              Well, what in addition to -- you brought up the 101 solution that she doesn't do what the statute tells her to do, so she's able to move it if the judge agrees.       And you said she has other options.                But then the creditors would have been a lot worse off, would they not have been?                Well, why would -- why would the trustee be urging the possibility that it would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?               Isn't that -- wouldn't that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time period that doesn't -- why -- why not just drop out those 2 months that are not representative of her income?              But the thing is -- but you have explained, your number one solution for her is this 101 route, which is -- gives lots of discretion in the court.              Yes.
09-10245 +++$+++        Isn't it enough for you to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based on, something could be based on several things, and one of them is the guidelines that then existed?       Mr. Heft, are you relying on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said, specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the judge says that he was adopting the probation report and the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you your sentence. So the hypotheticals we're talking about are quite far afield from where you have a specific statement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that the guidelines are being applied.       But now you're talking about a plea agreement, which the government has consented to whatever this agreement is and whether - whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll charge a small amount -- value of the drug.     Was there any of that in -- in this plea?       But in that event, the sweet part would be open to reconsideration too.     I mean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered guideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts are dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was agreed upon.     You would have to reopen the whole thing.
09-1036 +++$+++        Ms. Blatt, you do have a substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is mandatory and jurisdictional. So here, we have a time limit set by statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that dispositive?       And that is jurisdictional, 7292?       How much time does 7292 give to go from the Veterans Court to the Federal Circuit?       Ms. Blatt, you are making -- you said that the closest comparison is in the Social Security, because there's disability benefits in both cases.     Apart from that we -- one is commenced by a complaint filed in the district court, the other, a notice of appeal, is there any difference in the brand of review?     That is -- as I understand it, Social Security review, although it's by the district court, is also on the administrative record.       Earlier, Ms. Blatt, you said that they wouldn't even know.       Because they don't get notice; only the veterans -       Ms. Blatt, are you -- are you -- we have in Bowles itself -- it was from the district court to the court of appeals, and then we have from the court of appeals to this Court.     Those two provisions were cited in Bowles, the 2107.     And what is the provision for -- for cert?       2101.     Those -- those, as far as I remember, were the only provisions that were cited.       And that was -       That was the Federal Circuit's position until Bowles, right?     But this was an en banc decision, and it overruled two prior cases -
09-10876 +++$+++        Mr. Fisher, when you say "in the presence," do you -- do you mean it necessarily must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing set-up be permissible so that the technician or the analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it would be screened in -- in the courthouse?       The defendant didn't give his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate.     Is this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?       And that's what -- that's the New Mexico Supreme Court suggested, didn't they? They said bring the printout from the gas -- whatever - chromatograph, and then have an expert who was not the one who certified -- it was not Caylor -- but that here's the graph that came out of the machine, and this is the way this process operates. I -- in your answer to Justice Sotomayor, did you mean to agree with the New Mexico Supreme Court when they said printout plus an analyst who didn't do this particular run but knows how the process works?       How do you answer the practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will have no memory, in fact, of this particular test.     So having him there -- he knows how the process operates; he doesn't remember this particular one -- how does having him there -- what could be elicited on cross-examination of him that couldn't be from his supervisor?
09-1088 +++$+++ 
09-11121 +++$+++        Ms. Blackman, what is complex about a juvenile investigator?     That's what this police officer was.     So he's investigating a juvenile for juvenile justice purposes, and I think there's hardly anything more objective than that.     This case has child written all over it.     It's investigator who deals with children.     The first proceedings is going to be a juvenile proceeding. How can you not take that into account, whatever -- whatever these other factors may involve? But here it seems to me so rampant because this police officer dealt only with juveniles, and he investigated juveniles.       Would be one relevant factor that would be considered was that nobody called the parents?       The question really is if he is in custody.     And maybe there's something different about being in the room with a juvenile police investigator and the assistant principal and being in that same room with your parents there.       The way you phrase the question, you say, may the trial -- whether trial courts may consider the juvenile's age in Miranda to make the in-custody Miranda determination. Did you really mean "may," so it's discretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age is relevant to the in-custody analysis?
09-11311 +++$+++  
09-11328 +++$+++        Mr. Kerr, the line that has been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh Circuit took; is it not the case? I mean, Judge Kravitch said:     Yes, the Fourth Amendment was violated, so to that extent we're following retroactivity precedent.     But the remedy is something different.     That was exactly the line that she took, wasn't it?       And on your theory, I mean, there's another question in this case; that is, perhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory, as a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the Court decided that question, then -- then the question you're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would have no practical consequences. On your theory, the way you reasoned, shouldn't the Court first decide was this a legitimate inventory search, and if so, then we never get to any exclusionary rule question?       Essentially, is your argument essentially that we should distinguish never, which would be this case if your position is not right, and hardly ever.     Is that -
09-115 +++$+++        Well, they say that these -       But then, what -       What can -- Mr. Phillips, what can the State do that would be complementary rather than conflicting?
09-11556 +++$+++        Is there -- is there any case in this Court where what was suppressed was information that was lawfully in the government's possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired originally through the search?     Here we have the DMV records, they're public records.     I don't know of any decision of this Court that deals with suppression of evidence that is already in the government's possession, and if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.       Suppose the police following Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license plate, and then got this information, not as a result of his driver's license, but from the plate on the car?       They might show him as the owner of the car.       How much time do they have to wait?     Justice Kagan brought up if the police go to his home the next day.     You've brought up attenuation theory a number of times.       You -- I think now you have answered, he gets back into the car, drives it away, they can do nothing because it's too close to when they discovered his record of -- his suspended license. How much of an interval must there be?     What do you mean by attenuation doctrine?       I thought there was some rule about not being able to suppress a person's identity?     You've been asked a couple of times why are you going after the DMV record; you should go after the police identification of Joe Smith or whoever.     I thought there was some rule that says the identity of the person is not suppressible.     Am I wrong about that?       Why?     Because when he entered a guilty plea, you reserved only the question concerning the motor vehicle records; you didn't reserve any other questions.
09-1156 +++$+++        Mr. Hacker, do we know that from this record?     I mean, we know that the plaintiffs were able to identify -- there's some dispute whether it's 12 or 23, but do you represent that there were no other complaints made?     So that, let's say, there has been discovery; now we're just at the pleading stage.     The company would have said:     That's it; we didn't have any more.       But they might have been able through discovery to find that there were many more.       But why shouldn't that determination be deferred until there's discovery, and then we can know how many reports there really were?       Mr. Hacker -       Mr. Hacker, you just said, if I understood you correctly, that when the - when the news came out on Good Morning America, accurate or not, there was an obligation to do something about it, but among the -- the charges, it's not simply that there was these reports, but it's the way the company responded to them:     two press releases that said allegations of any linkage of the drug to anosmia are completely unfounded.     That statement was made even after the -- what was it, Dr. Jafek?       -- had this presentation, and he was going to put Zicam's name on it, and the company said you don't have any permission to do that. So the company prevented Good Morning America from happening earlier, and it made these affirmative statements that there's no linkage.       I thought that the scientific report that came out later said we can't say one way or the other, as opposed to the company saying that any suggestion of linkage is completely unfounded.       They didn't say "unfounded."     They said the evidence is not -- we can't say yes and we can't say no.     That's different from completely unfounded.       Well, but you -- you have said raw adverse event reports.     Am I not right that all of these reports came from medical doctors, and in response to the very first one, the company representative said, yes, we've been getting reports since 1999?       But my question is, does it make a difference if these reports come from medical experts in this particular field?
09-1159 +++$+++        That seems to be a factual dispute, so maybe you can be clear on that. According to Cetus or Roche, at the time that this scientist came to Cetus to work, there was no Federal funding; that that Federal funding for this project, the Stanford project, came about after the scientist had spent his 9 months at Cetus.     At least that's the picture that -- that they draw, that the Federal -- that they got their assignment from the scientist at a time when there was no Federally funded project.       Mr. Ayer, it seems the Federal Circuit emphasized a distinction between the scientist saying "I will assign," which was the language used in the agreement with Stanford, and "I hereby do assign," and it seems that that was critical to the - to the Federal Circuit's decision. They say -- they cite a whole bunch of cases.     The suggestion seems to be that if Stanford had said "I hereby do assign," there would be no case because Stanford would have been first in time.       Is that what we're dealing with in this case?     I mean, there was a -- an agreement, a standard Stanford agreement, that said I will assign any -- any patent.       So why isn't that the beginning and end of this case?     I mean you -- there are important questions presented.     But the Federal Circuit said everything turns on the difference between "I will assign" and "I hereby assign."     Cetus would have come second in time, therefore would not have prevailed over Stanford, but for, except, the Federal Circuit said, one is a future conveyance and one is an immediate conveyance.     You know -
09-1163 +++$+++        Even though -       Even though you -- you said that there is now 7, Exemption 7, the amendment to that, so you don't need 2 -       Still, as far as I know, every court of appeals that has weighed in has accepted Crooker.     And I was a little puzzled why you were so intent on rejecting so-called High 2, because after all, in this very case, Judge Fletcher, dissenting -- it's true -- but he said he accepts Crooker, he accepts High 2, and he still thinks you win.     So you don't need to reject Crooker to prevail.       Are you interpreting -       As I -- as I read the D.C. Circuit decision, you -- you are assuming or you're suggesting that the D.C. Circuit saw a gap that Congress hadn't provided for, and it filled that gap.     And now the add-on that the D.C. Circuit made is no longer necessary, so we lop it off.     But the judges on that en banc court thought that they were interpreting the statute going through all of the steps that you outlined.     Language is rarely so plain that there's no room for a different interpretation. And then Judge Edwards looked to the legislative history to see how that might inform the decision, but -- but really, to suggest that Crooker was just sort of a stopgap until Congress amended the statute I think is not fair to that decision.
09-1205 +++$+++        All you have to do is get a new named plaintiff?       And it could be the same attorney?       Would the -- would the decision that's saying -- saying Rule 23 standards have not been met, the individual issues predominate over the common issue -- doesn't that deserve some measure of respect when the same thing is tried again?       And this one was determined by the multidistrict panel, right?       But the absent class members retain their individual right.     I mean, they are not being precluded as to their individual claim.     It's only they can't be a class representative.       Am I right to read the supplemental brief as saying that now the West Virginia Supreme Court agrees with the multidistrict panel on what the content of West Virginia law is?       Here you have a different forum.     You pick up a different plaintiff, and you go to a different forum.     How -- and I guess your answer is that you could go on and on and on until -- until maybe you find a judge who will certify this class.       But we have a new plaintiff, so that plaintiff wouldn't have had notice and an opportunity to be -- to be heard.       Yes, but there are 50 States.       There are 50 States.     And if -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide class action.       Well, you have to -- I think you would concede that the Seventh Circuit's now two decisions, one in Bridgestone and then the other in Thorogood -- the Seventh Circuit thinks it can do this.       Can I just go back to what you said before?     I thought the West Virginia Supreme Court said you can't have actions for drugs under the consumer whatever.
09-1227 +++$+++        The government agrees that it's an enumerated power claim in this case.       You are -- you are at no risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the case arises, we can deal with it.       Mr. Dreeben, is your concern that there would be a clash in these cases? You've given the example of the State wants to have this registration system.     Suppose the -- the defendant can raise that and would prevail?     Well, the State's not party to that suit, its interests have not been represented.     Is that -- is that your concern?       Mr. Dreeben, are we getting to the merits of the case?       In the category that you would like to have saved, you said commandeering, but you said there conceivably could be others.     Is there anything concrete, anything other than commandeering, that might fall under this State sovereignty side of the line?       Unlikely to come up as a defense in a criminal case.
09-1233 +++$+++        One case, Mr. Phillips, is pending for 20 years; is that not so?       So it seems to me -- and there were something like 70 orders from the district court, the single-judge district court in that case.       And no -- no change.     So how much longer do we have to wait?     Another 20 years? Longer than that?       Is there in fact less overcrowding?     Because I thought that the -- what this case was all about was the receiver has said, the special master has said, we can't make any progress at all until there are fewer people; we have no place to put clinics. The first step, not the last step, but given the -- given what we're dealing with here, the essential first step is that we have fewer people so there is more room for these health facilities, more room for staff to operate.       Yes, but you can't -- you can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply the money for it.       Then if you -- then if there -- if there are these great changes in circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be administered in something approaching a decent way, you could go back to the single-judge district court and say:     I'm moving under 60(b).     Circumstances have changed; it's no longer the case that it's impossible to render decent health care.       What -- do we have information about that substantial reduction?     I mean, in this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no matter how many efforts have been made, the population goes up.     And now you say that the population has gone down.     From what point in time and how much has it gone down?       But I thought that officer himself said:     I can't do this without as a first step reducing the population; nothing else is going to work until we reduce the population to the point where there is room for clinics, room for medical personnel to operate.     I mean, that was the view of the district judge, the special master in one case, the receiver in the other case. Everybody -- they all agreed reducing the population is not going to cure it, not going to make everything perfect, but without doing that as a first step, nothing -- there will be no cure.       I don't get the class thing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just limited to the class.     The class wants to have clinics. They want to have personnel who function someplace outside of a broom closet.     So you can't deal with this problem by just dealing with the mentally ill and the people with medical problems.     You have to provide space for facilities.       I thought the -- the - that brief was filed because the -- there were -- in your presentations, there were representations about the special master, and he filed that brief to say:     You must understand this in context; I was making a speech at the club. So he wanted to put in context what you had used.     You had quoted his statements.       That's one piece of it. You said something about the 2.35 million.     They didn't come up with the 8 million, but they did come up with 2.35 billion.     And then I'm just looking at this brief for the receiver, and there's a footnote, page 11, footnote 3, that says:     No, that money isn't there; it's dependent upon several approvals that have not yet been secured, and such approvals ultimately may not be forthcoming.       But not the -       Not the 2.35 -       I mean, I think you did say earlier that this was a done deal, 2.35 billion. But this is a note telling us it's not so.       On one project, the joint legislative budget committee said, no, we're not going to give you money for that.       Can you explain me something about that?     It was confusing in the briefs, Mr. Phillips.     I thought that the State had said:     We don't want the plaintiffs to tour these facilities anymore.     We don't want to have discovery go beyond - what was it -- some date in 2008. I thought that it was the State that was urging:     We don't need any more discovery, we don't want any more inspection tours. So how could -- how could the plaintiffs submit more than they did when the State said it's enough, 2008 should be the cutoff?       But then don't you have the burden?     If -- if you have -- you concede that you have been in constitutional violation, then it seems to me you have the burden of showing that's no longer the case.     That's generally so in -- in -       Well, maybe -- you're talking about one of the cases, but the other one -- and it's the newer one, instituted in 2001.     But what about the one that started out in 1990?
09-1272 +++$+++        Where did the -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective state of mind on the part of the police?       That didn't -- that didn't apply in this case?       But why is -- why is that subjective?     Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?       They go to the apartment building, and they sniff at every door, and when they sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from the door, then they go through this routine, but they do it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a routine matter.     They don't just knock on every door, but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana, and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being stashed.       May -       May we just go back over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far as I understand from this record, it was never shown that the dealer that the police were following was aware that he was following and that he was fleeing from them. This is the -- it's not part of the question you presented, because we granted only on the exigent circumstances, but I didn't think that there was -- the dealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even know that the police were following you?       May I ask a question -       May I ask a question that goes back to what you said?     You have clarified very nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that there's something wrong going on in the -- the apartment.     And you said that is, at that point when they -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the door, at that point the police could go and get a warrant.     Then they don't have to, because then they knock on the door. We start out with a strong presumption that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, a strong preference for getting the warrant.     So why in this situation wouldn't the first response of the police be -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they alert the people in there:     Let's get a warrant; we'll come back.       And how is it -- you mention Johnson.       And I think the other side says it was the same thing except it was a hotel room instead of an apartment building.     The police smell -- in that case, it was -- what was it?       Didn't they smell marijuana or opium or something?       You left out one thing. I thought they heard ruffling noises before they attempted to get into the apartment -- into the hotel room.     There was something about noises.       And what was that here? Because it was kind of vague.     They heard movement. What kind -- what kind of movement?     It didn't -- it said nothing about a toilet flushing -
09-1273 +++$+++        Ms. Blatt, would you explain the function that the contract mechanism serves? I mean, you could just have this -- you could just have the statute say:     Thou shalt not charge more than the ceiling price.     Period. What -- what is accomplished by having the contract reflecting the terms of the statute?       Well, to the extent that you're objecting to the disruption of the Secretary, there is disruption when it's a private party bringing a False Claims Act.       Even if the United States doesn't take over the case, just lets the qui tam relator -       -- proceed?       You mean -- you mean there's no negotiated element to it?     It's what the statute -- it's the same as Ms. Blatt said?     It's -- the contract repeats the words, the terms of the statute, and that's it; is that what you mean?       Ms. Blatt said nothing has been done.     It just went into effect on January 1st, but are there -- are there plans to implement it?
09-1279 +++$+++        What about -- what about personal appearances?       Mr. Yang, can we go back first to this -- the request came in and, as I understand it, the Commission said there are two exemptions:     The one for trade secrets, commercial, financial confidential information; and then there was one with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee.       How does the -- does the Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee, as distinguished from the corporation?       Yes.       Mr. Yang -       What about the Privacy Act?     The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals, human individuals -       -- not artificial beings. But it uses the words "individual privacy" -       Mr. Yang -       Your argument is based on a case that will come before us.     So -- but in this case, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been -- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA exceptions are to be narrowly construed.
09-1298 +++$+++        Mr. Phillips, when the contractors -- when they failed to deliver the first aircraft at the time specified by the contract, their reason was that its costs would far outrun the contract price, and so it sought to reformulate the contract. At that time -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I think at that time the contractors said nothing at all about superior knowledge and the government's obligation to share information that it hadn't shared.       But you would expect them to say, if they -- if that was the impediment to going forward on this contract, to at least mention it.     And to -       Can you explain that - you've referred to it several times now.     I thought that that was not a progress payment based on completed work. The government says that that money was advanced; you had not complied with what was necessary to comply with to get that 1.35 million.     They distinguished the $1.35 million that you legitimately received as a progress payment, but this next, they say, you have not fulfilled what you needed to do to get that.       But you are here seeking to -- to emerge as a total winner, that is to get from this contract what you would have gotten if it had been successfully completed, including any profit -       I would -- I think it's questionable, Mr. Phillips, for this reason:     You say that it's an implied term of this contract that the government has a duty to share certain information, and you are seeking to enforce that implied term of the contract.     So it seems to me, as to that alleged duty, you are the moving party.     You're saying:     Court, please enforce this implied term of the contract.       You mentioned the 1.3 - that you get to keep the 1.35 million, but there was also another figure -- 1.2 million that you would get on top of that.       So that certainly wouldn't be leaving you where you were.       It was thinking of a tort.     It wasn't thinking of -- Reynolds is a tort action.       But you say -       So you are saying there is another way?     There's a middle way?
09-1343 +++$+++        In all of those cases, there was a forum in the United States where someone injured in the United States could sue.     Your proposition is that a company can deliberately send its products, wants to exploit a U.S. market.     But I take it that there is no place in the United States, because New Jersey is no different than California or any other place -- is it your position that there is no forum in which MCIntyre can be sued, even though it set up this distribution arrangement for the very purpose of having its machines in as many locations in the United States as it could?     Is there a forum in the United States where it could be sued?       Which one?       It could be reached in Ohio.     Now, does that make a whole lot of sense?     Is it any more convenient for MCIntyre to come to Ohio than New Jersey?     It's a lot less convenient for Mr. Nicastro, who had his fingers removed by this machine. But you -- you are conceding that there is a forum where this British company can be sued on a tort that occurred in New Jersey.     Explain to me why, since there is a forum in the United States, the logical one isn't New Jersey rather than Ohio.       I'm asking you -       -- the question can it be sued?     Well, something happened in New Jersey. The machine, allegedly defective machine, caused a harm there.     What happened in Ohio?     What basis for specific jurisdiction is there in Ohio?     There was no tort in Ohio.       I don't understand.       What kind of common law indemnity are we dealing with here?     Where does Mr. Nicastro sue?     He hasn't got any assignment, any indemnity.     Mr. Nicastro is injured in the United States by a machine manufactured in England, and he wants to sue, understandably, in the United States.     Why are we talking about assignments, indemnity?     That has nothing to do with Mr. Nicastro.       No, I would just like to know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and not in New Jersey.     In New Jersey, it's the place where the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but the relationship between the distributor -- there's a contract between the distributor and MCIntyre.     So why does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?       It's a forum what?       And the claim in suit. That's very important.       I still don't -- I don't follow how Mr. Nicastro gets involved with assignment, indemnity.     Mr. Nicastro has a claim against -- well, he sued them both, but the distributor is now bankrupt. And he says, well, this is specific jurisdiction; specific jurisdiction, as International Shoe teaches, is where the claim arose.     International Shoe, it arose in the State of Washington because that's where the shoe - the people who were promoting sale of International Shoe's -- International Shoe's shoes worked every day. So it was a claim relating to a tax owed by International Shoe based on the events that occurred in California.     It was not all-purpose jurisdiction. And your suggestion that Ohio somehow is a proper forum for Mr. Nicastro's tort claim, I really don't follow that.       Asahi -- Asahi, Mr. Fergenson, was a litigation between a Japanese component part manufacturer and a Taiwanese finished product manufacturer.     What -- how in the world could you compare that case, which really has nothing at all to do with the United States?     It's -- it's a Japanese valve manufacturer sells the valve to a tire maker in Taiwan, and there should be -- that suit should go forward in the United States? I can see it going forward in -- in Japan, but it has no connection with the United States.     And how can you possibly compare that with this case where somebody was injured by a machine that malfunctions, allegedly? There was something very interesting you said in your brief.     And you said the U.K., which you - you say -- now you've added Ohio, but you said U.K. would be the place for Mr. Nicastro to go.     It provides a trusted legal system. What would be your answer if the manufacturer, same arrangement with a distributor, sell anyplace in the United States you can, is from China? Would you give the same answer?       You -- you made a point about the trusted legal system.     Well, let's say it was Russia, Mexico -- you may pick any one.     The machine is manufactured in one of those countries where it's not so certain that there's a trusted legal system.       Those that -- the -
09-1403 +++$+++        Mr. Boies, how would it work in your view of the case?     That is, you say that the loss, what's been called loss causation, is not something to be decided at the certification stage, but at the trial or summary judgment.     Well, how -- how would the plaintiff class prove loss causation?     Given the reliance hurdle that you have surmounted, now you're in -- you have your class certified; how does the class prove loss causation.
09-1454 +++$+++        Why would he face liability?     Because he didn't have the opportunity to challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision; therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him.     A party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an opportunity to raise it on appeal.     So why would Camreta be precluded?     Why would he face punitive damages as you're suggesting?       Well, why isn't the answer, then, that that's the right case to take up? Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not going to be confronted with this situation again and who has put herself out of the running for damages because she didn't -- she didn't challenge the qualified immunity ruling.     So she has no stake in any monetary relief from this claim.     She has no continuing -- the - what has happened to her, happened to her at age 9, will never happen again now that she's past 18. So she hasn't -- if she came to court today with her case as an 18-year-old, she would have no case or controversy.     It just seems like the whole case has evaporated.     She has no claim.     She did have a claim for -- for money damages, but she has relinquished that. So, what -- what genuine controversy is before us?       She was the plaintiff. In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff still had a viable claim, right?       But that didn't have to do with the school search -- the school seizure?       So -- and this case presents the question about was this unreasonable?     That -- what's left in the case has to do with the mother's claim, and it has to do with putting the girls in custody, right?       What happened in - what -- what has Oregon done in response to this Ninth Circuit decision?     Before it said that the caseworkers could have this kind of interview with the -- the child where there was a suspicion of abuse.     Was there any change in practice in Oregon in response to the Ninth Circuit's decision?       What about -- did she - did she -- let's go back one step.     Does she have any viable claim now?     This is not capable of repetition, evasive of review?       You have very limited time.     Could you -- could you go to the merits of the Fourth Amendment question and give us the Government's position on that?
09-1476 +++$+++        Why would it make -- why would it make a difference at what you call the balancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction is between public speech and private speech on the one hand or government as employer and government as sovereign on the other?     Why would there be any difference?       Why not?       Mr. Ortiz, you're not drawing any line depending on the branch of government, in other words, executive, legislature.     Those are certainly branches of government to which one can petition.     But access to court you agree comes within the Petition Clause?       What about the -- this as I understand it, came up originally as arbitration under the -- wasn't it under the collective bargaining contract?       Would that count also, because it is a mechanism set up by a government employer?       But you are not challenging that, as I understand.       Mr. Palmore, what about the distinction that the other side brings up that Connick is about what happens inside the workplace - you don't want to disrupt the routine by the kind of activity in which Myers was involved -- but the Petition Clause, they're talking about conduct outside the workplace, that is a complaint filed in court, nothing that's happening in the workplace.
09-1498 +++$+++        Mr. Roberts, is there - is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress might have had in mind is that in criminal cases inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after that period runs?       Is it because, Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that question?       But I think you don't.       -- because -- because your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say calendar days, but included statutes for the first time. So I think what you're saying is that the interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule 45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now calendar days, there is conformity.     And plus, "statute" is in Rule 45, and that was at least laid on the table of Congress, so they know that it was there.
09-150 +++$+++        How do we -       How do we tell that? Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what happened, you'd ask the very same questions.     You're saying the questions are relevant also to securing the situation.     But what -- what different questions would you ask if you wanted to find out what happened?     What was the past -- what were the past events? I mean, I'm trying to understand how you take these questions and say we can put a label on them here that says, well, this is to control an emergency situation versus we want to know what happened historically.       Suppose he had -- suppose he had survived.     Suppose Covington had survived -       -- instead of died.     And then the prosecutor says, I want to introduce this evidence against Bryant.     Would you say that, yes, it's nontestimonial, so it comes in?       But why, if it's nontestimonial?       If you said -- you said it's -- you're typing it nontestimonial.     It goes to emergency situations.     So I'm saying:     Would that carry over to the man survives and the prosecutor says, I don't need to put him on the stand so he can be cross-examined; I've got nontestimonial evidence that I can put in? Would it become testimonial, then, if he survived?       But then -- then your answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in.       So are you saying that the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what had -- the nature of the crime?       In the -- if you had the benefit of hindsight, and this trial occurred before Davis, and so the prosecutor went on excited utterance, would you have instead tried to make a case that this was a dying declaration?       Well, how do you know that?     Because they would ask the same very questions if what they wanted was testimonial evidence.     So you can -- you can characterize that set of questions either way.     What would lead us to pick one rather than the other?       Do we look to the specific situation?     I mean, one of the officers zeroed in on the victim.     No one was looking around to see if anybody was lurking in the bushes.     Then, as far as protecting the public, do we take into account that this was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are not likely to be many members of the public around?     Or do we just say you find someone who looks like he has been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter whether the public is around or not, we -- that's enough, the victim of a violent crime can be asked these questions?
09-152 +++$+++        I take it that the government is urging that "unavoidable" means unavoidable in the vaccine that has gained FDA approval.       And could it be used for all five -- there are five inoculations in this series.       And only one of them was not approved for the first three.       If there is a safer alternative, it must be pursued regardless of cost?       Why was it taken off?       And so didn't the special master find what -- in the compensation proceeding that causation had not been proved?       Well, you -- you say that in court you could prove causation, since you had discovery, although you couldn't prove it before the special master because discovery was very limited?       Anyone could go to the State -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court could go to court on the argument that the amount was insufficient, the amount of compensation. There is -- there is no foreclosure of anyone to come to court; is that right?       In the -- when it was - when Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it was approved and marketed, was that one available for all five inoculations?
09-1533 +++$+++        Mr. Pincus, if the -- the substance that is involved in this case was a rock-like substance and it wasn't a powder.     So why doesn't it belong?     It's a rock-like substance.     Why should it be outside the category cocaine base?       Correct me if am I wrong about this -- I may have a misimpression -- but I thought you were objecting to a charge to the jury that charged cocaine base and didn't charge crack.       But you just said it's an academic issue because there's not a market for leaves or for paste.     What Congress was getting at was crack. The judge used the term cocaine base.     Assume you are right.     What should happen?     Could you go back to the judge and he would then say, well, this is -- the chemists testified this is crack?       It was -- it was -- the testimony was it was a rock-like substance.     What wasn't said was -- what is it?     Bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, was not mentioned.       The -- the district judge would be the finder, right?       Because you have no Apprendi problem?
09-158 +++$+++                Mr. Fisher -               -- you -- you say -- you present this argument that it is a second petition and you say that's the only issue before us and there is no other way that the new proceeding would be cut off under AEDPA. There was in this case, in the first -- when the -- the sentence was set -- set aside, an order by the district judge; and it said:                Magwood, I want you now to bring out all conceivable -- all conceivable claims on pain of forfeiture. Why doesn't that alone -- this is an order by the court:    I don't want you to engage in seriatim litigation; I want you to bring forward all conceivable claims.    And that was an order and it was made on pain of forfeiture.    Why isn't that dispositive of this case?               Yes, but what he's bringing up now was a conceivable claim that he could have brought up then.               But the issue is the same.   The issue is that he didn't qualify for the death penalty because at the time he committed this offense, there had to be, in addition to the eligible offense, at least one aggravator.                 So why doesn't preclusion result from the court's order that says:                  Bring up all conceivable claims?              Mr. Fisher -- Mr. Fisher, to get -- I get your "second, it's a new judgment."                  But thinking in terms of what AEDPA was attempting to do, we have two claims, one after the other.                  The second claim is one that would take away the death penalty forever, that would be it, because he said the only sentence I can get is life without parole. He brings instead, first, one that doesn't make him -- that still leaves him exposed to the death penalty.   So the court has been put upon twice.        If he had brought the first claim and he is right about that, he's not death eligible.         Instead, he brings a claim that still leaves him death eligible, and the court has been burdened twice, when easily he could have brought, as the district judge instructed him to do, everything the first time.
09-223 +++$+++               It wasn't brought up - comity wasn't brought up in Hibbs because if the -- if there was an alleged constitutional violation, then there was only one way to go.             The parochial -- the payments to the parochial schools could not be -- had to be eliminated, so there was no question of abstention versus invalidation or doing something else that was fancy.   That's -- that's why this case is nothing like that, because there was only one way -- only one cure. But you mentioned here there were various things.   What -- the Federal court could -- is -- is being asked to increase somebody else's taxes.                  That's a very strange notion.     But what could the State court do? The same case in State court -- and let's assume there is a constitutional violation, either the Commerce Clause or the equal protection.               What could the State court do that a Federal court couldn't?              Where is -- the cases running up to Hibbs, those were all cases that involved racial discrimination, and they were in the Federal courts.
09-291 +++$+++        She's married to him.       Because you start with somebody who is -- who is unlike the shareholders. There's no Title VII violation as to them.     Regalado is complaining of sex discrimination, and then she said, because I made a complaint, they retaliated against me. Shareholders are not in that position, because there was no initial charge there.       What -- what do you do with the argument that says there's a middle step?     You can -- you have the sex discrimination complaint, and then you have Thompson, who is aggrieved in the sense that he was hurt, he was injured.     But they say there's no cause of action, there's no statutory cause of action, for Thompson.       You're not taking the position that she could not have sued for retaliation? It would be awkward because he is -- it's his injury that requires compensation.     But are you saying that she could not have brought a retaliation suit?       Let me -- because your time is running -- the Americans with Disabilities Act has an explicit provision that allows suits by adversely affected close relatives.     You are essentially asking us to read that provision, which is stated expressly in the ADA -       But that's different from the -- the point that you were first making, I thought, was these are lay people; they don't have a lawyer; they would naturally think that the person who was hurt would be the one to sue.       But EEOC thinks he's the right person.       Mr. Schnapper, in the points that you're making, would you have an answer to this point that was made about the burden of proof?     The argument was that you wouldn't have MCDonnell Douglas anymore, and you wouldn't know how to proceed on this third-party claim.
09-329 +++$+++        Mr. Waxman, I take it from this whole discussion that you are recognizing that this is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some ambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much deference we owe to the agency.       Mr. Waxman, why are we getting into all of this, because there's no question in this case that the Federal Reserve Board had authority to issue Regulation Z?     There's no question about what authority Congress gave to -- to the Board.       So -- and the only question is:     So -- so the Board adopts Regulation Z, and then a question comes up, what does it mean?     Well, surely the Board that wrote the rule is first and foremost the proper interpreter.       Mr. Palmore, suppose there was no triggering event, but in the initial statement the company said:     We reserve the right to raise the interest to X amount.     No triggering event, just a reservation of the right to raise the interest. Would that have to be -- and then it implements that later on.     Would the cardholder have to have notice of that under the old reg?
09-337 +++$+++                 Do you know, Mr. Bendure, what exactly the corporate relationship was between the two?              Thank you.               What was the first -- when was your first notice of that?                     I mean, it was on the first page of the ticket, but the answer came after the statute of limitations.            Was that your first notice that there was this different entity, or did you know that earlier?               Did the -- did the name show up any place other than page 1 of the general conditions of passage?               That's -- and this is what?     An 11-page, very small print --                Mr. Bendure, would you explain one factual matter to me?                 I might have gotten this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the 1 year had run.                So when the answer was filed it was too late for you to come within the statute of limitations.                And I thought that would be the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, because when you got the answer -- which was filed after how many days?              If you had gotten that a few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we wouldn't be here.               But the basic point is the answer didn't come in until you were already out under the statute of limitations.               So from their point of view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that.              Mr. Bendure, in addition to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the ticket came; it said "Costa Cruise" -- were there any other connections between the plaintiff passenger and Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope that says "Costa Cruise"?
09-338 +++$+++               Because the foreperson at first hesitated.   When the court asked the question, "Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not," then there's no response.            And then the court says, "Yes or no?"     And only at that second point does the foreperson say "no."         So it was a reluctant "no."               And that's another factor in this.    We have the transcript.                Are you urging that, because the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw the jury, worked with the jury, that that's something that deserves a special measure of respect?               There was no -- there was no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and the court then said immediately afterward:                   The jury is dismissed.   So there was no interval for an objection?               But what is the status of the -- the Allen charge in Michigan?                    Has Michigan taken a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible thing for a trial court to do?               And that wasn't requested, either?              She.              Mr. MCGormley, do we have any indication how long this trial judge was on the bench when this trial came up?              Yes.                Mr. MCGormley, you have stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have emphasized the two screens.              This comes to us after we have the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme Court ruling.     So the case isn't all that easy, without making the judgment as though it were coming up in the Federal system.
09-350 +++$+++        But there was no objection on the part of the State.     The State was to pay the lion's share of the fees, I think 90 percent, right?       And the State is not contesting.       Who is the "they" who would do this?       This -- this is getting further removed from the situation that we're dealing with, because the State has already admitted liability and not has contested that its fees -- it owes fees. So, what is the relief that is left?     If the -- if the State has admitted liability, what happens at that point?     Shouldn't the record be expunged?       But the State has already conceded.     It's been adjudicated a constitutional violator, and the State is now saying, yes, we are not going to contest that anymore.     Doesn't the State have to do something?       It's true that all cases that at least have come to us under Monell have involved damages.
09-367 +++$+++                 It can say 90 days.         It can say 90 days.                This is a -- this is, in one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it not?   Because it's true that this defendant, from the probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what restitution was going to be recommended.              But, functionally, isn't it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a crime might have?    Wasn't what Congress was trying to do was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the defendant and having his kind of civil restitution tacked onto the criminal proceeding?              Is there no -- is there no possibility that a judge could say:                  I want to make this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is, I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence.                  So this order is final, and 3 months later, I ll take up the question of restitution when all the information is in.   The court is prevented from doing that?              So the judge -- but the judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that they need time for more information:                    I'm going to defer the whole sentencing.            So, Defendant, you ll have to wait 3 months to find out how much time you re going to serve.   That would be all right.             You could use the -day period to extend the time for imposing the sentence. Well, in effect, you re saying the sentence isn't final, so she could change it any time within the days?               Well, that s rather theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge surely would have acted before he could process an appeal.
09-400 +++$+++        But there is -       There is a defense for the employer that, no matter that there was this ill will, there was enough else to warrant termination of this employee.     And so the -       Wouldn't it -- wouldn't the employer's defense simply be:     Anyone who starts a fire goes.     That's -- that's a -- it would have happened no matter what the reason was for doing that.       That -- that just comes under the employer's defense as showing that the same action would have been taken.       Mr. Schnapper, is that your recollection of this record, too, that -- that he was -- he did state his version before he got the pink slip?

09-448 +++$+++               Are you saying that in Hanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and here there is?              In Hanrahan, there was no prod from the court; the court didn't say anything that -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to the action, wasn't it?                Suppose now, in response to "Do it right," Reliance on a complete record and very careful review finds that total disability was not proved.     Then there would be no fees, right?
09-475 +++$+++                 But Winter didn't involve something -- as I understand, the -- the decision vacated the deregulation order.                 You are not challenging that.   Well, it seems to me if there s no deregulation decision in place, then we re back to the Plant Protection Act, and there s no authorization for the planting of these crops.           So as long as you haven't challenged the vacation of the deregulation decision, I don't see how there's anything for us to deal with.               I m looking at --               I'm looking at page 58a. Maybe that -- you referred to what as the district court's --               Because I thought that the only purpose of this injunctive provision was to spare the people who had already purchased seeds, allowing those to be planted until March 30, 2007.                Well, then --                Mr. Garre, I'm looking at the injunction, and it says that the deregulation decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article.      We could simply say as far as it goes, that's all right; anything else is surplusage.                   We take it to be the judgment that Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period.                 Well, but I thought --                 I thought that was just a dispensation to people who had already bought the seeds. That was recognizing that they had incurred an expense, that they were all ready to plant.                   That -- that was the only exception.     It goes back to the status of a regulated article with this one exception.               Would you explain, Mr. Garre, why that's so, because I thought that the Federal law is before the agency engages in an action that requires an EIS, it has to do the EIS?                   So this unit of the Department of Agriculture violated Federal law by deregulating prior to the completion of an EIS.              Can -- when you -- can you stop right there, because I thought the law was, government agency, before you engage on a major activity, EIS first, and then you can have a deregulation order?                Yes, that's what I thought.                But as far as the court is concerned, it's conceded that NEPA was violated, an EIS was required.    And then the district court vacates the deregulation decision.            I thought that, under the APA, at that point, the court is obliged to say, well, the agency engaged in conduct that was not in accord with law, and so we send it back.               Do you agree -- would you agree that if the district court had just said the deregulating decision is vacated and Roundup Ready alfalfa is once again a regulated article, period, that would be okay?   And you would have no basis to prevent this from going straight back to the agency?               And all, it seems to me, that the district court did do in addition to that is to say that alfalfa seeds may be planted -- alfalfa seeds that are -- that have already been purchased may be planted prior to March 30, 2007.               It s the only exception.              But wouldn't it be the same problem for the farmers if we had only the deregulation decision vacated?              They can't do anything until the agency then gives them permission to do something.              And that's going to take time.              I mean, it's going to take time, and you have the EIS on track within a year.                    So are you going to do this other operation in 6 months?
09-479 +++$+++        So that means there would be no punishment, added punishment, at all for the possession of the gun; that is, you have the -- the possession with intent to distribute, no gun involved, and you get 10 years mandatory minimum for that.     That automatically would wipe out any add-on for the gun, under your reading.       Yes.     I think you weren't finished answering my question.       But that is not mandatory?       So you're saying that the gun possession can be accounted for by the judge as a matter of discretion using guidelines, but there's no mandatory at all?       Don't most crimes of violence and drug trafficking carry more than a 5-year sentence?       Mr. Ryan, I thought that you had three positions, and now you're talking about the second one, which is any greater minimum sentence arising from the same criminal episode.     But I thought your first position was any greater minimum sentence applicable to the defendant at sentencing.       But you have offered three different readings, so one can't say that this statutory text has a clear meaning, which I think is your first argument -- that it has a clear meaning.     And yet, we have Mr. Gould's reading and then the two readings that you've offered us, same episode and same gun.
09-497 +++$+++               But if -- if fraud in the inducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have a very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in the inducement is considered a question for the court, not the arbitrator; is that right?              So why should unconscionability be treated differently?              What about the specific examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration, win or lose, that's the provision.                   Would that provision be enough to make the issue one for the court rather than the arbitrator?              But is it?      We don't need the "if."     Tell me whether you think a provision saying the employee under any and all circumstances pays all costs -- would that provision make this question of unconscionability one for the court rather than the arbitrator?              But all of the arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a whole.               Mr. Friedman, this contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said, it was more employee-friendly than most.                 It had a clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with the court.   The review -- at the end of the line, there was to be court review, and as the parties said, it should be just like review of a district court decision, a much -- much more focused review than would be in the case of an arbitration agreement. Now, that clause comes out because of our decision in Hall.    That leaves the -- the arbitration agreement in -- in an imbalance.                There was court review assured at the back end.          So why isn't it reasonable to say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the front end?               But it was very limited review.     But the parties to this agreement put in a clause that provided for the standard review, not the very limited review that the Arbitration Act calls for.               How could it be in the district court?     We didn't decide Hall Street until after the district court was finished in this case.               I thought you were making, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he said, well, they didn't raise it.                 They didn't raise that with this provision out, it was an essential provision, so the contract was void.                     They had no reason to make that in the district court because Hall Street was not yet decided.
09-520 +++$+++        I thought the concern was that the interstate actors should not be disadvantaged vis--vis the home people, the local businesses, and that was what was achieved. But you're -- you are not complaining about discrimination against a railroad in comparison to local businesses.     You -- you are complaining about that you are not getting most-favored-nations treatment vis--vis other interstate carriers.       Mr. Phillips, are you saying that the -- the railroads have to be taxed in the very same way as, say, the -- the trucks?     Because one answer to your argument is:     Well, they haven't created a non-tax situation for the other interstate carriers; they are just subject to a different tax.     The motor carriers have to pay motor fuel tax. So are you saying to the State about that, you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and sales tax for the other?       Well, why does the course for the court -- taking account of what you said, that the provision about other taxes came out very late in the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about the property tax.     And the property tax, we know, they wanted to preserve the exemptions. So why not take this latecomer of thought or discussion and say:     Well, we'll assume that they want to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket item.       I think Justice Kagan meant to ask, assuming that we say yes, it -- it applies; exemptions don't count -- are included in whether there is discrimination, and the Court finds discrimination between the way the railroad is taxed and the way motor carriers are taxed, what -- what then? What is the remedy?       Without -- without putting on -- I mean, the motor carriers do have the tax.
09-5201 +++$+++               Mr. Sady, you -- you said something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent? Do we have any information on, (A), the number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get the full credit and how many get something less than the full 54 days?              But the argument -- one of the arguments is it is not punishment at all.             This is a reward; this is a reward for good behavior.
09-525 +++$+++        Well, somebody deviated from what was the announced policy, that there was to be no market timers investing in this -- in these Janus funds.     Somebody made the decision that certain hedge funds would be allowed to engage in that activity.     Who was that somebody?       Well, the statement that's alleged to have been -- the conduct that is alleged to have been in opposition to the announced policy, that is attributable squarely to -- what you - this is the entity you called JCM?       So it made the decision that violated the policy?       Nonetheless, it's not a primary actor?       Mr. Perry, you -- you said that it was the fund's lawyers who drafted the prospectus, but, in fact, it was JCM's lawyers, the lawyers -- they were in-house lawyers for JCM.     And they served -- and they served the funds in doing this prospectus, but they were on the payroll of JCM, and they were JCM's legal department.       I thought they were in-house lawyers?       But the law firm that - the lawyers who drafted the prospectus were in-house counsel for JCM on JCM's payroll.       But they weren't the independent outside lawyers who were representing the board or the funds; they were the in-house counsel?       I guess my question was simply:     The drafters of the prospectus were the in-house counsel for JCM?       Well, this case -- this case went off on -- in the district court, it was -- was it 12(b)(6)?       Okay.     And all that the Fourth Circuit said is it goes beyond; it has to go further.     And the -- the impression that I got from the Fourth Circuit's opinion is -- and it could be reduced to a very simple statement.     They say:     JCM was in the driver's seat.     It was running the show.     And if that can be proved, they thought that they would have a good case under -       But that was -- I mean, before you started out with a statement that sounded like the sky is falling because lawyers would no longer be safe, banks would no longer be safe, but the Fourth Circuit was -- was a much narrower view.     Its view was this -- JCM was the manager.     It was controlling everything.       But the -- the whole arrangement was made possible by JCM.     JCM wants long-term investors, so it puts this provision in the prospectus.     The board of directors have no reason to believe that JCM is dissembling and it's going to go out and seek hedge funds.       What was the theory of - of the fund shareholders?     You said the fund shareholders recovered -- there was a settlement.       What -- what was that action?
09-529 +++$+++        Mr. Galanter, if we can go back to get what this -- this entity was.     The Federal legislation gives the States a choice.     They can do it either in a State agency or a private entity.     The specification that the State agency has to be independent is in the Federal statute, isn't it?       It's not -- it's not up to the State to want to put it into an independent regulatory agency.     And is it -- and this VOPA -- is that an entity that was created just to carry out this Federal program or was it a pre-existing agency?       And does it do anything else other than administer the Federal program?       Ms. Anders, I understand that most States that -- that are taking advantage of this program do it through a private entity, not a State; is that -- is that right?       Doesn't -- doesn't the Federal statute say, Virginia, if you want to do this through a State agency, that State agency has to be an independent agency and have the authority to sue?
09-530 +++$+++        General Katyal, why are we getting into this?     Because this case, it seems to me, is a challenge -- your challenge to a preliminary injunction which was quite narrow.     There was only one question at issue.     There is no cross-appeal, is there?       So we have Form 85.     The only thing that's in contention there is the question about treatment or counseling.     Nothing else.     So why are we talking about the universe of what questions might be asked? And on the other form, I take it, it's just the so-called open-ended questions, not everything on the form.       So, what do you think has been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a preliminary -- a preliminary injunction, has there?       I thought the -- the entire Form 85 was approved, and there's no question you could ask about, have you used drugs within the last year?     It's only the question about treatment and counseling that's -- that is at issue, right?       But the -- the circuit precedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85 -- the circuit said that's okay.     It's permissible to ask those questions.       The answer to that is obvious.     It was raised by the other side.     If it's for the good of the employee, make it voluntary.       Where did it come from?       Do you -- do you have a clear idea of how the Form 42 would have to be amended if the Respondents are correct?     Form 85, we know, is the excised "counseling or treatment."     What in the Form did the Ninth Circuit say -- it said "open-ended questions," but I looked at the form, and it's not clear to me which ones they considered open-ended.       I still don't see why that -- why the universe is before us, because the Ninth Circuit said some of this form is okay; most of Form 85 is okay, and some of Form 42 is okay.     I thought it was only the questions under 7 and 8, the open-ended questions.     I didn't think the Ninth Circuit had enjoined anything other than those questions.       But whatever he asks, we are reviewing a judgment.       And the judgment is not the universe; it's certain questions can be asked.       I don't see how that's so because, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the questions on that form but one.       So, I mean, you could raise the question, but you'd be out of court in a minute.       I thought they did in the lower court but abandoned it here, challenge the question about the drug use.       Is that also within the Government itself?     I know the Privacy Act says the Government can't disclose, but how about checks -- I mean, we have a vast government -- checks about circulating the information within the Government?
09-5327 +++$+++             How many circuits have said that there is equitable tolling?            Then it's a question of what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said -- yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a deception --            So they re drawing the line between intentional and -- and without intending but just being careless.            Mr. Scher, one point that you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in your brief, was that counsel here said:              Oh, the deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before I was appointed to represent this man, so there was nothing that I could do for him, because the time had already expired.             But he never asked -- he wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed when the judgment came down.            Then you are -- you seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a distinction between paid counsel, who is just as careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the other case, the client was given this attorney by the State.   So I think you re suggesting that the State has some responsibility when it provides the counsel. But before you said, no, your answer would be the same if you were not making a distinction between court-appointed and paid counsel.             But you would say -- it is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary negligence as opposed to gross negligence?
09-559 +++$+++               But -- but don't you have -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the complaint.              Count 2 would be the counterpart to the exception that s made from the disclosure requirement with regard to contributions with certain organizations whose members might be harassed.              That's -- that's not -- that would still be open if you lose the first part of this case. So going back to the question you were asked, how does this differ -- that Justice Scalia asked -- how does this differ from the contributor who says, well, I might be harassed?                The contributor would have an opportunity to show that.             So, that's why I m asking you why, on the first part, should it be any different, as long as you have the door open to show that if you were going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an exception would have to be made?             May I -- may I ask you one -- something that was not in your brief, but was in the Secretary's brief.       Is this list available to Project Marriage?   And specifically on page 34 of Secretary Reed's brief, the statement is made that the sponsoring organizations sometimes sell or trade these lists.    They use them for fundraising purposes.         So that would be the end of a person's privacy, at least on one side.    Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses these lists?             Yes?              They don't say agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes.                       But that's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the petition that the --              -- signature collector can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising purposes?               I don't think that's -- that's true of Buckley II.            What was -- what this Court said could not be done is that the solicitor could not be made to wear a badge that says "I am a paid solicitor," but that the solicitor's name had to be identified for the State.           Certainly, the solicitor -- there was an affidavit, and there was the filings with whatever was the State agency. So what was -- what this Court said could not be done was this kind of in-your-face big button that says "I am a paid solicitor," but the solicitor's name and address certainly had to be disclosed.              Let me stop you there, because I think your -- your own brief, I think you said twice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's belief from the mere signature.               You said it could be support for -- for the proposition or it could be just support for letting the people decide.              Or it could even be, you say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we ll just sign.   So you -- you have said that -- that the signing itself is ambiguous.               You don't know what the reason is.     It doesn't necessarily mean that the person is a supporter of the proposition.              May I call your attention to page 20 of your reply brief?                 Because I don't think that your response was correct.                 You say:   Do petition signers support the repeal, simply indicate they would like public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid any further discussion with the petition circulator?              They did that.   It wasn't due to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged, under Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed.              Mr. Bopp, this is not a peculiar thing to the State of Washington; that's correct, isn't it?      Aren't there about 20-odd States that require disclosure of the names of signers to initiatives, referenda?              So -- but what you re saying with respect to Washington would go for most of those other States that have -- that have public disclosure of initiative and referendum petitions.               I thought that there were instances where the State official missed something and a member of the public who had access to the list of signers said:    Wait a minute; I know so-and-so was my neighbor who died 5 years ago.               But you mean if -- that was over.   It passed the screen of the Secretary of State. It's disclosed to the public.              If someone then said you've got a lot of dead souls on these lists, the State would do nothing about it?                 Well, we ll ask -- we ll ask the --                 We ll ask the Attorney General of Washington.               Why would you involve the court?   If the State's -- the executive representative of the State says:      Oh, we missed that.               Now we're going to have to deal with it.           We don't need any court to order us to do it.            No, this is after the observers.   This is --            We re talking about a member of the public noticing that there are people on the list who shouldn't be there.            Why would they ask for judicial review instead of going first to the State's Attorney General and saying, look, you -- your people missed it?            Why involve the court?              Well, then that s --               So everybody agrees that that's still in the case.              The court did not rule on whether there was a risk of harassment here.              It dealt only with count 1.
09-571 +++$+++        Isn't this something in between?     Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one rookie police officer.     Here, it wasn't one rogue prosecutor.     There were four prosecutors who knew of this blood evidence, and there were multiple opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this quiet. Now, if we were just talking about -- what was his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case. But we have the three other prosecutors.     And so I think it's questionable to characterize this as a single incident.       Life doesn't always come in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this doesn't fit into a single rookie. You have -- if you have four prosecutors who are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like there's kind of a culture in the office that we don't turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will show you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from Thompson to have it mean anything. So there was misunderstanding about that. But what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into a single incident, it doesn't fit.     So we have a situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly confronted before.       Can you tell me -- I think I have a copy.       Is that so?     I mean, you are assume that everyone who goes to law school takes a course in criminal procedure, and I think there are many law schools where they don't even have such a course and others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure.     So you're assuming that.     And, of course, the time is running.     There's something I wanted to ask you about Brady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would want special vigilance.     And that is, Miranda warnings, you know what was said; search and seizure, you know what the police did.     But the problem with Brady -- and this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know. If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do, there's a very high risk, as there was in this case, that it will never come to light. So, recognizing the legal obligation of the prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady evidence because it doesn't help the State's case, shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking about a Brady claim?       Did you -- did you object to it?     To this charge?       With the "or" -- difficult choice "or" one that prosecutors had a history of mishandling.
09-5801 +++$+++        In all cases, it is true in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold. So a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases. It just means that you say:     This is the way women are, this is the way men are.       Mr. Hubachek, how do you deal with the argument that, really, this is a classification where the unmarried woman is being favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed with the married couple?     So it's kind of like Matthews v. Heckler:     The woman is getting a special favor and the unwed father is treated like most people who married -- couples who have children.       First, can we be clear about what you're saying?     I thought your argument was, you are not touching married couples.       So that you are talking about equating the unmarried father to the unmarried mother.     Do you have -- is there any notion of how many people we're talking about? I mean, in these extensions versus the normalization, where the Court generally extends when there is a small class to be covered, a small class was left out, and in a large class is already covered.     And the reasoning has been:     Well, my goodness, Congress wanted to take care of that larger class; it would be most destructive of the legislative will if we said you can't cover that larger class. So as a group of unmarried mothers as against unmarried fathers, do -- do you have any notion of what the numbers would be?       Mr. Hubachek, I think the Chief asked you:     If it's an equal protection violation, then the Court just says it violates equal protection, but whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a temporary solution, because the legislature can't be convened on the spot.     And the Court actually did go through that exercise, extension versus invalidation, most conspicuously in Califano -- Westcott, in the Westcott case.     It says, yes, that's what we have been doing in all these cases. In Sarah Frontiero's case, we didn't say: You've been discriminated against; Congress, you fix it. We said:     You get the quarters' allowance that up until now has been available only in male officers.     And in Wiesenthal, the father got the same child and care benefits as the mother.     So the Court was making a decision for extension; it recognized it had to do that.       That he is a United States citizen.       And it also said that the remedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set up to do that.     I mean, that's what Westcott said.     The court can go one way or another way; it can't do any fine-tuning, because it's there as a temporary legislature.     The ball goes back to Congress to do what it will, but it's just, in the interim, we need a solution.       But Congress did make at least some change, right?     It -- this is -- it's no longer five years; it's only two years, right?       What were the criminal cases where there was -- where the defendant was permitted to raise -
09-587 +++$+++        How do -- how do we know that the -- the California court even reached that question?     Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question raised?       But did -       Well, what would the California Supreme Court do if they all agree that this application should be denied, but two of them think it's for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others think it has no merit, and they say just "denied," but there's no majority for either one?       Even though, in fact, it wasn't?       So we -- so there is that possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we should assume it was on the merits. What about -- I mean, you said this is three decades, but we are told that the California Supreme Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply "denied," that's most likely that they couldn't all agree on a reason.       But that's what they would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?       If, in fact, the court was divided, all agree that the petition should be denied, but there's no majority for any particular reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say "petition denied," right?       Mr. Colombo -       Mr. Colombo, you -- you say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even assuming there was, there would -- there would be no prejudice in this case.       And could you just summarize why you say there would be no prejudice?       What about the -- the pool of blood?     There was one expert affidavit that said something about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not have produced that amount of blood.       On the -- on the no prejudice issue, are you relying just on what happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime?     I mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have been moved with no trail of blood at all.     So, you say, therefore no prejudice. Any -- anything else that goes into your no prejudice argument?
09-60 +++$+++                Mr. Srinivasan, as a threshold question, is there a mootness problem here, because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to the country illegally and committed another minor crime? But his coming back illegally and being turned away again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry. So even if we were to hold in your favor now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any other dispensation.     Is that so?              I -- I -- I think also in the picture is that he never contested removability. The only thing was the grace:            Would -- would he qualify for discretionary relief by the Attorney General?            So the -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand.
09-6338 +++$+++                 Ms. Freeland --               Ms. Freeland --               May I take you on another path, not the question of the difference between the two -- two sections.              We have a large prison population, and then Booker comes down, and then the guidelines change only as to crack cocaine, nothing else.   All of the others whose sentence has become final cannot get into the court's door because they don't have the entering wedge. In what system -- what fair system would say, aha, because the crack cocaine guideline was reduced -- the disparity was reduced -- these people are now going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the others who are identically situated with respect to all other factors, they don't get their sentences revised?            But why should, bearing in mind that entire prison population similarly situated, the courts say it s -- the finality bar is lifted only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity has been reduced?             If you -- if you are right that this benefit goes to -- only to the class that can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful motive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its guidelines reductions retroactive?            Ms. Freeland, what would happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going to -- I deny the motion?        Would the judge then have to go on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece, I deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want with the rest of it?            Well, if -- suppose Congress and the Sentencing Commission had made it crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but only with respect to one piece.             You say -- you say no matter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional law, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence is up for --            -- consideration?               Can I get you to go back to -- you said something that only the executive can grant clemency or ought.    What -- what about a program where a district judge says I'm going to have this person undergo a course -- a drug addiction course, and if the defendant successfully passes the course, then I ll give a lighter sentence?    That -- that --               Did your answer exclude that -- that possibility?
09-658 +++$+++        But isn't -- isn't Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight, leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime, that carries heavy weight?       What about Judge Berzon's test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea bargain?     The confession certainly -- it -- this serves the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on the prosecution's side.       Mr. Kroger, from - General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate? You are not contesting that the confession was involuntary?     You seem to be putting everything on the prejudice issue; is that right?       What about his argument that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he ended up getting that exact same sentence that this Defendant did?
09-6822 +++$+++        If the law of the case -       If the law in the case is left to the district court, then the district court can say, well, the law of the case -- that's what that other judge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable time, and I'm -- I appraise it differently. The -- the judgment has been vacated, the sentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the case survive?     I mean, is -- the judgment is no longer -       Can a district judge say later on in the process:     I made a ruling earlier in the case; I've since done a lot of research, and I now think that that ruling was wrong?       Well, what do you do with 3742(g)(2)?       Has the Sentencing -       Is the Sentencing Commission -- it still has that guideline that you can -- you can depart -- you can lower within the guideline, but not beyond it?       Yes.     Is it -       But as far as the Sentencing Commission itself is concerned, its position is still that postconviction behavior does not warrant a below-the-guideline sentence?       That -
09-737 +++$+++        So Mr. Mills, what then is the difference?     You point out, quite rightly, summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and the question for the court is:     What could the plaintiff prove?     When we get past trial, the issue becomes:     What has the plaintiff proved? So, what was brought out at trial?     What was the record at trial that was larger than the record at summary judgment?     Because if there -- if there was no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact presentation, then it wouldn't matter.     It would be the same body of evidence, right?       Why is it -- I mean, power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a case.     But we are in an area where there are many, many cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule because in the background is the Seventh Amendment Re-examination Clause.     That's the whole reason why there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the verdict. So I'm surprised that you're using the word "power." You're not referring to any of that history which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh Amendment.       What -- are you saying then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the trial record, so it's different from the summary judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they would look at the evidence differently, even though they purported to look at the trial evidence?       So, if you're right, then there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with instructions to send the case back to the district court to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the evidence was sufficient?       But you -- you prevailed on the summary judgment motion.     There was a summary judgment motion, right?     And it was denied.       So the -- we know that the district judge thought that, at that point, there was a case to be presented for trial based on the plaintiff's allegations.
09-751 +++$+++        Well, why does he have a -- a claim?     As I understand it, after this case arose Maryland passed a statute putting time, place, and manner restrictions.     I read that statute, and it seems to me that there was nothing unlawful, nothing out of compliance with that statute, that was done here. It was at considerable distance.     There was no importuning anyone going to the funeral.     It stopped before the funeral, the service, began. Am I right that, under the current statute, this conduct was not unlawful?       Didn't they -- didn't they stand where the police told them to?       And they were there to the knowledge of the police and with the permission of the police.       But they didn't prohibit it.       Which this the case, which the facts here meet.       You -- you knew just what was going on.     Do you suppose -- because this had been done before.     In fact, wasn't this the very same day they picketed at Annapolis and at the State Capitol?       So they knew what the signs were going to be.     Could they have gotten an injunction, do you suppose, against this protest?       So you could go into court and say the signs were this, that, or the other thing at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis; they're going to use the same signs at this protest.       Did they have the "Going to Hell" sign at the State Capitol at Annapolis?       Those particular ones that you mention, did they have those at the other two?       So it sounds like the "you" is the whole society, the whole rotten society, in their -- in their view.       Where did -- you said the Fourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the family rather than the whole U.S. society?       Your -- your claim is that Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure, and the Snyder family is not.     So I think what I got from your brief is you don't fall under that case because you're not dealing with a public figure.       It was or it wasn't?       I thought that -- that when the service itself began, the protesters stopped.       That was defamation, wasn't it?       So --       We have other instances where conduct is lawful, meets all the terms of the statute that's meant to govern protests at funerals, and yet there's an award of damages permitted.       Well, that was a -- I'm asking you for an example where -- a Federal case where the conduct was permitted by the statute, by the policemen there, and yet there was -- was a damage award.       I'm talking about this intentional infliction of emotional distress claim that you're bringing.       Well, it certainly wouldn't be because of the distance.     I mean, you'd have to be a lot closer than the Maryland statute allows to spit in someone's face.
09-804 +++$+++        Mr. Olson, when you say the employees had no choice, but the district court found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared that there might be a backlash on the part of the employees if they found out, if they were told the truth about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable, that they would not have the same benefits that they had under the prior plan?       I thought that what the district court said was that they would treat the plan as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it was part of the plan itself, not an amendment, amendment.     I thought that was what the district court said.       But they can't do that because the statute requires the summary to be understandable and not prolix.       But wasn't the -- wasn't the meaning of "likely harm" simply that they were promised one thing in the plan document, and so what likely harm is, is we have to do away with what they call, what is it, "the wear-away effect"?     So that's the harm, the wear-away effect, and we have to remedy that. And the way to remedy it is to treat this as, what is it, instead of (a) or (b), (a) plus (b)?       Yes.       But it couldn't be --       But it couldn't be brought as a class action, and isn't that a large piece of this picture, that proceeding as they did they can proceed as a class?     Proceeding under detrimental reliance, it would be hard to get a class because it would be an individual case of detrimental reliance.       Then the question is, under the -- under the section that the district court proceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a class action would be appropriate.
09-834 +++$+++        And there wasn't -- he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.       In this case, he didn't invoke the grievance procedure.       So that would keep you out, if that were the test, that you have to formally invoke the grievance procedure.     But we are told that every other time the word "file" is used in this Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing.     And so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue.       Is there another provision where the word file is used to mean something other than a writing.       Are you -- you -- are you urging that if you just tell a coworker, that that's enough?     I thought the whole idea is to give the employer notice that something is amiss.     So, how would telling a coworker serve that purpose?       What did he do?     What did he do specifically?     I mean, you are saying that -- that the employer has to know that he is making a complaint under the Act.     So what -- and you said here are the facts that was clear that he did.
09-837 +++$+++        Mr. Olson, are -- are all institutions that employ residents schools?       But it might -- it might be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to have residents who are not working at, quote, "schools," subject to the FICA tax, and other residents whose training is approximately the same escape the tax.       But you can't give me the reality there.     Are all resident programs conducted in schools, or are there resident programs that would not qualify because they take place in institutions that are not schools?       Mr. Olson, why not read that provision -- now we are going to the statute -- if such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as saying, look, there's a student status, and the service is distinct from the student's status? Take the typical work/study program in a college.     That would seem to fit this language to a tee. There's a student, and the student is working part time, but you are -- there -- there is no independent significance to the term "student" as you read the text; that is, the student and the services are all together. It's not, "I am a student here and I perform services there."     It's -- the student is -- the education is the service.       But wouldn't -- wouldn't this fit the work/study student who is studying philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech department?       The -- it seems to me that -- what came into my mind when I read these words was a work/study program where the student is studying and that's the status of student.     The work is separate from that.     It's not necessarily to advance the person's education.     It's to give the student some money.     So that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this was describing student status, okay; and the student is also working for some money. But you seem to say that the service - that -- that it's -- the student status is not independent from the service.       No, I have in mind the typical work/study program.     The -- the student signs up for work/study and may be assigned to work in the administration, helping out with clerical things there. But the student status is one thing; the services are another. Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that the earnings of the student in the work/study program would not be subject to FICA?       Mr. Olson, there has been a concern expressed that if we accept your position that residents are students, it will have ramifications for other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor Relations Act.     Suppose the residents wanted to organize and collectively bargain.     If they're students, they can't do that. And let's take the Title VII and the other antidiscrimination in employment statutes.     If they're not employed, if they're students rather than employees, then they wouldn't be covered by that legislation.       Mr. Olson, you're not taking issue with what Mr. Roberts just said?     That is, in practice the -- Social Security looks to see -- they look at the W-2, see if the FICA tax was paid, and if it was, then -- then they get credit for Social Security.
09-846 +++$+++        But you recognize that sequential suits could be brought.     So that if the case in the district court went to final judgment, then it would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.       But you don't have control over how long the district court case is going to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running of the statute of limitations.       But you couldn't get both.     I mean, that's I think Justice Sotomayor's point, about duplication.     It's not -- even if you can say, yes, it's a different mode of relief, but you could - couldn't get -- I mean, suppose we didn't have 1500 and you prevailed in your suit on the APCA or whatever you call the statute.     You could not then turn around and sue the government official, because you have the -- the single claim, you've been compensated.       It's not here -- it's quite different.     I mean, one suit is not precluded by the other.     You -- you recognize that by saying you could bring the Claims Court suit after the district court suit.     That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.       I -- I'm not sure I understand your answer to my question.     Assuming you had a recovery under the -- for the -- confiscated cotton, under the one route you had a recovery.     You could not sue again under the other route without -- leaving aside 1500, because the claim would be precluded.       But not so, not so here, because of the way Congress has set up the authority of each court.     You could never -- what is it, 54(c) or -       54(c) is the relief to which you were entitled.     The only relief to which you were entitled in the one court, the Court of Claims, is compensatory damages.     So there isn't a question of some other form of relief.     You have to go to another forum to get different relief.       To test that choice - it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for the district court. But your position is that under your reading of Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment. Under your reading of the statute, the Casman decision was wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back pay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both.       What about the Loveladies situation?
09-868 +++$+++        But, Mr. Weisman, the phrase is "post-conviction or other" -- "or other collateral review."     And certainly the Rule 25 -- 35 motion is postconviction. So it's postconviction.     It's not direct review.     Why isn't that responsive?       "Or" usually means it's something in addition.       Can you go back to the - you said -- you said "prior to."     I thought the Rule 35 motion is made after the conviction.       And the current Federal rule -       -- provides for -- it's Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency? That's Rhode Island's?       Can you read the -- the relevant provision of the Rule 35?     I mean, there are two categories, the ones about legal challenges, at least as I read the rule, and -       Read the relevant part of Rule 35.       So you're talking about reducing -       Justice Scalia's suggestion -       -- that perhaps the - the leniency review is -- is not review of the conviction or sentence.     But you didn't -- you didn't do anything with that.     You didn't argue that the kind of review that's involved with leniency is really not review of the sentence for legal error.       So what -- is it something in between?     It's not direct and it's not collateral?
09-893 +++$+++        There's nothing -       There is nothing that indicates that California's laws are applying a different concept of unconscionability.     You haven't come up and said, oh, look what they did here.     And in another case they said it has to shock the conscience. Maybe across the board, California is saying:     We think that unconscionability should have a broader meaning.     Is it unfair to the weaker party to the bargain?     Is there really no genuine agreement here?     And if that is so, that will fit our definition of unconscionability. You don't have anything that says -- the California court hasn't said:     We are applying a special definition of unconscionability to arbitration agreements.       Well, any contract that would have an arbitration clause.       Can we criticize one feature of this?     You are not claiming that, vis  vis litigation, arbitration is being disfavored, which was the original concern about arbitration agreements and what prompted the Federal Arbitration Act.     The courts didn't like to have their business taken away, and so they were disfavoring arbitration contracts. That is no part of the picture here, as far as I can see, because the rule is the same whether it's litigation or arbitration.       Mr. Pincus, are they necessarily saying that?     As I read it, the plaintiff brought a case to court, not to arbitration, and then there was a motion to stay the State court litigation. Why isn't it a proper reading of this case to say:     You want -- if you are in the arbitration forum, it's bilateral, but you can't dupe these plaintiffs out of a class action?     So if you don't have a class action in arbitration, you can have it in court. That is, the class action is preserved, not necessarily in the arbitration forum, but in the court.       So if we look at the California law and we find other instances of unconscionability that are applying a standard less stringent than "shock the conscience," then we would say okay?
09-9000 +++$+++        May I ask you about - Wilkinson was a parole, parole eligibility, so it didn't touch the conviction or the sentence, where this one does.     So the cases are distinguishable on that basis.       I understand that argument, but there is the distinction of the type of case of where the -- the one, conviction and sentence were never going to be questioned, only parole eligibility; where here, the discovery that you seek in 1983 is not a destination.     The destination is to further litigation that may or may not arise.       Mr. Owen, you're fitting your case into our decisions about the line between 1983 and habeas.     But if nobody -- if you didn't know anything about that and you looked at what's presented here in a civil case, it seems as though you are splitting your claim; that is, you want discovery, and if the discovery is favorable, then you ask for relief from the conviction. So it's the -- it's quite unlike I'm complaining about prison conditions.     Here, the whole purpose of your seeking this discovery is so that you will be able, if it turns out to be in your favor, to apply for habeas.       Could you have sought habeas?     Is it 1983 is the exclusive relief, or could you have sought habeas relief?
09-907 +++$+++        Doesn't the chart say "ownership costs"?       And you would read that to mean non-costs as well?     I mean, if the -- if the table is called ownership costs, then why not use the IRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition says, what, loan payments and lease payments?       Mr. Burke, before you respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that cost is no longer being incurred?       My question is situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect that that -- there's no longer any expense for ownership.       But it isn't -- it isn't automatic that because there's one payment, then forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the $471.       Yes, I was.       Why not just -- it says you are supposed to look at the form; it says ownership costs.     So the only thing you'd look at the IRS for is -- the manual -- is to define ownership costs.     And they say ownership costs means those two things.       I don't follow that.     If the simple thing is to just -- what does the word "costs" mean?     And then you look to the IRS manual, and it tells you that "costs" means loan or lease payments.       Mr. Burke, the -- it's unusual to allow a deduction for the purpose of calculating disposable income although you don't have any expense.     I understand how you get to that conclusion with respect to car ownership.     Is there any other provision that in -- in calculating disposable income, you are allowed a deduction for an expense that you don't incur?       No.     The question -- is there anything else that works like this?     You don't have the expense, nonetheless you have the deduction? Any -- I mean, there are a whole list of deductions, expenses.     Is there any other one that works this way? It doesn't matter whether you have the expense, in fact.       You may want to save the rest of your time for rebuttal.       Mr. Burke, would you explain one facet of this case to me?     Given the deduction, the $471 deduction, disposable -- projected disposable income comes down to $210?       As opposed to -- it would be 600 some dollars if you didn't count the $471?       Even though the disposable income figure was $210, the debtor was willing -- the debtor proposed paying $500.     Why did the debtor come up with a $500 figure when projected disposable income without the car ownership would be - if he gets the car ownership, would only be $210?
09-958 +++$+++        Ms. Schwartz, the government doesn't have the injunctive power -- as far as California's rates are concerned, California puts them into effect.     The government can't stop that from happening, even if the government thinks that they are in violation of the Medicaid Act; is that right?       Yes, but that's a very drastic remedy, and it's going to hurt the people that Medicaid was meant to benefit.     Does the government have any injunctive power, or is its only -- only remedy a fund cutoff?       How often has it happened?       How -- how often has in the Medicaid context --       But what about the providers who say, but under -- under the State law, if we charge more than the hospitals -- if we charge more than the State ceiling, we are subject to sanctions, so this does fit into the category of anticipatory defenses?       But wouldn't they be -- the rates go into effect.     Someone charges more on the theory that the rates are impermissible under the Supremacy Clause.     That person would be subject to sanction under State law.       Mr. Kneedler, before you sit down, could you please enlighten us on two fact points?     One is, what is the status of the 30(A) rulemaking?     Because I take it once the rule is made, it would get Chevron deference.     You said that there would be a final rule in December.     Is that still --       How about the -- the status of the -- the hearing on California's compliance --
09-987 +++$+++        General -- counsel, does anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this scheme?       And if we leave out the fine points that you were discussing, isn't the underlying premise of Flast v. Cohen that the Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we recognize taxpayer standing?       If you're right -       But it is -- there is a plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights, and most provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose free speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have. It's in the Constitution like all the others, and I thought, to be candid, that that's what the problem was in Flast v. Cohen, and that's what the Court was responding to.       But it wasn't -- it wasn't -- I don't remember whether the Government participated in the Winn case when it came up under the Tax Injunction Act.       And there wasn't a word from the Government about lack of standing.       There was a case in this Court.     The name of it was Bob Jones.     It was a private school, and it discriminated on the basis of race.     And the question was whether they could have a tax-exempt status so that there could be donations to them.     Do you remember - case?       -- the outcome of that       But you -- you said there was an STO before this program, but it didn't get the benefit of money from taxpayers that would have gone - that money went to -- to Arizona, not to the STO before this scheme was created.
09-993 +++$+++        But you have another - you have another route, and that's what the government is telling us:     That you could propose a revision of the label, and if you did that, then you would be home free. You would not be subject to the State suit.       No, it was in the -- at the cert stage as well.       The Federal agency says that these suits complement, they're not at odds with, the Federal regime, because they give the manufacturers an incentive to come forward.     Everyone is interested in making sure that only safe drugs are marketed.     So, far from detracting from the Federal regime, the agency responsible says, this helps us; it encourages manufacturers to report.       Mr. Lefkowitz, there's a certain overlap, is there not?     Some of the generics are made by the same people that make the brand-name drugs, isn't that so?       And at least for those people, they have the means.       The government is taking the position that there's no clash between the government, the State, and Federal law.     It's not saying that you commit some kind of Federal offense if you don't file this law.     The government is saying, the question is preemption.     Is there a clash between Federal and State law to traditional Federal warn you have a preemption defense if you tell the FDA, and if either the FDA does nothing or tells you, no, we're not going to change the label?       The -- the -- Buckman was about, was a -- it was a very odd case to be brought under State law for fraud on a Federal agency.
09-996 +++$+++        Well, what about the charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the 5- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do it on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred, and there's no rationale to when they do one or the other.       Would they have to - would they have to justify the delay first?     I thought there was something about, well, if the time question is more difficult and the merits are easy, there's no merit, so we just decide this.       And in California, if it just says "denied," then the presumption is it's denied on the merits; is that it?       And -- and if -- so if it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has to be something to indicate that it's for that reason? Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?       There -- this was taken over by California from capital cases, but in the capital case context, there -- they have a 90-day presumption of timeliness.     And when they extended the capital framework to non-capital cases, they left out the presumption that within 90 days is timely.     Was there reason for that?       Was there reason for and then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely.     Why didn't they add that to the original rule?       Yes.       Well, why would it be different in the capital context?     What was the reason for adding the 90 days there?
10-10 +++$+++        Mr. Waxman, in your opening statement, you said whenever, in civil contempt, a person is subject to incarceration he or she is entitled to counsel.     In your opening statement, you didn't limit it to cases like the case we have before us; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay. Therefore, I can't get out of jail. Are you limiting -- are you limiting your argument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a former husband who says I just haven't got the wherewithal to pay?     Or are you making a broader claim that anytime someone is subject to incarceration they must have counsel?       Are you saying all the - all the trappings of criminal procedure come with it? This case is focused on a right to counsel, but what about burden of proof, what about a jury trial?       Mr. Waxman -       Mr. Waxman, you mentioned Lassiter, and you mentioned something that Lassiter said in passing, but what was at stake there was deprivation of parental status.     And the Court said sometimes, in some cases, yes; but we're not going to make an across-the-board rule. Now, that deprivation, some people think, is the worst possible, for a custodial parent to be told you're no longer a parent, you no longer have a child. And yet, the Court said we're not going to provide counsel in every case, because in some cases the person can get a fair hearing without counsel.       Does that go for alimony and palimony as well as child support?       So, the answer is yes, it would cover.       Is there a State -- we've been told that, in many States, appointment of counsel for an indigent, noncustodial parent who has -- who has child custody arrears, that counsel is automatic.     You have described something less than counsel.     Is there any model, any State where there is such a procedure so one might find out how it's working?       What about an aid who is not counsel?     I mean, the family court has a lot of auxiliary people like child advocates who are there to assist people who need some kind of representation, but not necessarily a lawyer.     Is that any part of yours - of what you would propose?       Is the form you have in mind something different than the form, the IFP form, that would be filled out say, by a 2255 petitioner?
10-1001 +++$+++        But if you --       If your main position is right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings? I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by a trial judge first, not an appellate judge.     And yet in 2255 proceedings, if you're urging ineffective assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right to counsel.     In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be appointed only if the court determines that the interests of justice so require.     So, the proposition you're urging would have ramifications in the Federal system as well, wouldn't it?       And so, 2255 would no longer be the interests of justice so require because if it's your first opportunity to raise the point, the court must appoint counsel for you.     That's your view?       Because of the what?       Why would it be successive if it could not have been raised earlier?       If -- if you are permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel limited to that point, or can the counsel representing the client bring up other things?       But could it be that the counsel could also bring up a Brady claim, newly discovered evidence?     So wouldn't be limited to ineffective assistance of counsel.       It's not a question of pay.     I think Justice Alito was asking, counsel says: I've got a duty to represent my client zealously.     So, I want to bring up not only ineffective assistance of counsel but these other matters.       So the -- postconviction application would go to the trial judge, right?     And on the --       All right.     So, go to the trial judge with this Anders type brief that doesn't raise ineffective assistance of counsel, but it's such an obvious claim to make that when the -- when the judge reviews that Anders brief, if the trial judge thought that this defendant was abysmally represented, wouldn't the -- wouldn't the court say:     Sorry, I'm not going to accept this Anders brief.     It seems to me that you -- there was a flagrant ineffective assistance of counsel, and you should have raised that.     That's a -- that's a viable issue.     So, I'm not going to accept your brief. I mean --       So, if the judge reviews the Anders brief, really thought there was an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a valid one, the judge would have spotted the issue, and it would have been -- and it would have been argued on that first --       Yes.     In the Martinez case, there was an Anders brief, right?       Doesn't the trial court -- I mean, the excuse -- the excuse of counsel is not automatic; the trial judge has to look at it and say, yes, there's -- there's no issue for you to pursue; so, I'm going to excuse you.
10-1016 +++$+++        Mr. Foreman, I think everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress said there is this close association of women with children; we think it's going to be good for everybody if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly parents, sick children, sick spouse.     So, we -- we can see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype, trying to open up caregiving for both sexes. But you have answered the question that women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no disproportion.     So, how do you tie that, just -- just that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the obvious association of women with childbearing?     So, we extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with child care.     There isn't that same link here, is there?       What relief did you ask for?     Damages, we know, and the -- you have to overcome the Eleventh Amendment.     Injunctive relief, you don't, but did you ask for it?       Well, you --       You must have asked for such other and further relief.       Well, Congress must have thought that giving the woman back her job was an important part.     I mean, I thought the whole idea is she wasn't supposed to be fired.     So, I think that the -- the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly important.       When you -- when you --       When you say you're concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful.     So, if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it?       But you're relying on the incentive -- the disincentive to hire women of child-bearing age.     The law protects the woman of child- bearing age by saying, Employer, you can't refuse to hire her, promote her, and all the rest because of pregnancy.       I'm just asking you about -- your -- your argument rests on an employer acting unlawfully, you see.     He won't hire -- we have to give them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise the employer won't hire women.     And that's -- the question I'm asking is, you are assuming that the employer will break the law by refusing to hire women that -- of child-bearing age?       But I -- your argument to a large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one kind of discrimination against women in the job market.       And that -- that discrimination was refusing to hire women of child- bearing age.     Well, they couldn't do it out and out because that would be a violation of the law.     So, is Congress having in mind discrimination that is under -- under the radar screen, that it's going to go on even though it's unlawful?
10-1018 +++$+++        That's across the board, Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated?     Is there any situation in which a private attorney engaged to assist a government office in the performance of a public function would lack qualified immunity?     Or is it simply wherever a government agency employs a private attorney to assist it in doing its work, that attorney will have qualified immunity?       I thought that in this case the -- the firm that the lawyer was associated with said its dominant business was giving advice to local government, local municipal government units.     So --       There's another part of qualified immunity, and I know it's not teed up in this case, but why is it reasoned decisionmaking to recognize you can't enter a home without a warrant, but you can tell the occupant to bring out every item you want to see?     It seems to me that that's not -- that there -- there's clearly established law to say that's wrong.
10-1024 +++$+++       Then maybe Congress 13     shouldn't have passed this statute.    But the injury, the 14     invasion of privacy, that's not something where pecuniary damages are -- are prime if they exist at all. 16     I mean, this is -- the -- the tort that this is 17     comparable to is intentional infliction of emotional 18     distress.    The -- the person who is subject to this, to 19     this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have 20     out-of-pocket costs but is terribly distressed, nervous, 21     anxious, and all the rest. The -- the act that the Congress is reaching, the impact of it is of that nature, not -- I 24     mean, pecuniary damages do not ordinarily attend conduct 25     that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental distress.      Even if it is -- even if 14     it is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a 15     pecuniary kind.    So, you could say that Congress was 16     much more generous than the common law was, but the 17     impact on the person who is suing is not going to be 18     out-of-pocket business loss, pecuniary loss; it's going 19     to be the embarrassment, the humiliation.    So, it's -- 20     it's -- if Congress wanted to do something about the 21     impact on the person it has given a right, it's not 22     going to do something that has to do with pecuniary 23     damages which it's not likely the person in -- in this 24     plaintiff's situation is not likely to suffer.      At least, did he allege 14     that he had suffered an actual injury?      I didn't -- I didn't ask 18     you that.    I asked you, did he suffer an actual injury, 19     as opposed to someone who is complaining about something -- an abstract right or an abstract theory? 21     Is there an actual injury here?      Well, you have to have an 4     injury first before you can get damages.    So, my 5     question is, was there an injury?      Yes.      What does "actual 17     damages" mean under the Fair Credit Reporting Act? 18                 MR. FEIGIN damages" by itself in a waiver of sovereign immunity is 24     not a clear and unambiguous waiver of the United States' 25     sovereign immunity for claims of emotional distress. And as to statutes which do not allow claims 2     against the United States, it would be a question of 3     context and legislative history.    And we'd have to do 4     the same kind of workup of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 5     that we've done of the Privacy Act in this case.    One -- 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:    But it can mean, and I 7     think it has been held to mean, damages to a dignitary 8     interest.    Mental distress has been held to -- the term 9     has been held to mean that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.      Just to question what the 11     term means, what the term "actual damages" means. 12                 MR. FEIGIN So, the fact that in the Privacy Act it 18     does include -- it may include emotional distress awards 19     doesn't mean that that's the sense in which Congress 20     used it in the Privacy Act -- I'm sorry; I may have said 21     that wrong.    The fact that in the context of the Fair 22     Credit Reporting Act it may include emotional distress 23     doesn't mean that that's the way in which Congress used 24     it in the Privacy Act.    And I think --      Well, the -- the Privacy 19     Study Commission coming after can't say what the statute 20     means.    I mean, that would be post-legislative history. 21     I mean, the statute exists, and then we have a Study 22     Commission to see what amendments might be made.    But 23     the Study Commission can't decide what the -- what the 24     Act means.      But that's just saying that he didn't have a good claim for relief.    But let's 2     take the worst case, where -- where a government official spreads all kinds of false information or even 4     true but terribly embarrassing information about a 5     person, does it deliberately.    Let's take that case, 6     because your rule covers all of them.      But it's --      It did set a pretty high 6     bar for the plaintiff to meet, because the plaintiff 7     would have to prove intentional or willful conduct, not 8     negligence, but --
10-1042 +++$+++        Mr. Russell, when you say the agency in charge, am I right in thinking that HUD and its successor -- they don't have any suit-commencement authority?       For injunctive relief?       But they're -- but the purchaser is the giver, and the statute reads, "No person shall give and no person shall accept."     The acceptor is the loan company.     The person who is giving would be the consumer, the customer.       But -- so, the person who gives is -- is not answerable under your reading of this (b)?       But then we have Quicken as the giver and the person who receives the referral or kickback as the receiver.       Mr. Russell, there's one puzzling aspect of -- of your interpretation.     It would be a rather large thing for Congress to say we're going to cover overcharges, as I believe HUD says is -- counts; and yet, in the -- in the purposes of the Act on page 1 of the appendix, it says nothing about overcharges, nothing about payment for a service not received in the -- in the four -- "it is the purpose of the Act to," and then there are four things listed, and none of those say to stop charges for services that weren't performed.       But that is -- that is HUD's interpretation?       But you -- you are now splitting HUD's position.     HUD's position says overcharges are reached by the statute.     You say not overcharges, but only a fee when no service is performed.     So, why couldn't the customers have said there is a fee for the service performed, that's the reasonable fee; and the rest of it is a charge for a service not performed? I mean, can you really maintain that distinction between an overcharge and a fee for services that are not performed?       Where do you get --       Where is that in the policy statement?     The difference between unearned and --
10-1062 +++$+++        But the court of appeals did say that there would be no independent liability under the -- for violation of the compliance order. That is, unless there was a violation of the statute, there would be no penalty for violation of the compliance order.       What -- what kind of review are you seeking?     I mean, one thing you could say is you dispute that this property is subject to the Act. That might be a question that's reviewable.     Do you seek more than that?     Do you seek review at this stage of anything more than whether the property is subject to the Act?       What would the standard be that -- before -- you have APA review.     So, it's just that -- that the EPA acted reasonably in determining that you have wetlands?       Is there no limitation on the compliance order?     It just -- it can be there forever until the EPA decides to bring an enforcement action?       I asked you earlier, in this APA review, would there be any further question after the determination is it wetlands, is it not?     And you had said no, that's -- that would be it.     But you answered another question that would suggest it may be wetlands, but it shouldn't -- there should be -- you should be allowed to build your home anyway.
10-1104 +++$+++        We go back to what you said initially; that is, if there's no alternative remedy, Bivens fills the gap. Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, only the State law allows survivor actions.     In Carlson, I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether there could have been a State tort.       Is that so?       Mr. Franklin, there were some references to Mississippi law that seem to be inconsistent with the notion that all States would provide an adequate remedy.       Is it -- and it might hold State prisoners as well.       It might hold -- some private facilities will take State prisoners as well as Federal prisoners.       And if they do have State prisoners, the State prisoner would have recourse to, not Bivens, but 1983.       So, you have two prisoners, identical mistreatment, and one gets a Federal remedy and the other doesn't.       Did any of those courts address the problem of how the pro se prisoner is going to get an affidavit?       Mr. Shah, go back to what you said about lacking -- these private -- these employees of the private corporation you said lack qualified immunity.     But they do have -- courts have allowed them to have a good faith defense.     So, in practice, how different is that, whether they have qualified immunity or whether they have a good faith defense?       What about the character of the claim?     If it's a Bivens claim, it's a constitutional claim.     It's an Eighth Amendment claim. And if you're looking to State remedies, that's an ordinary tort remedy with no constitutional involvement.       Do you know if any of these Bivens claims have been pled in the alternative; that is, a Bivens remedy, but alternatively State law?       Is there diversity in this case?       So, you said there was a statute of limitations problem with starting new.       What about, if there is diversity --       -- allowing an amendment?
10-1121 +++$+++        Mr. -- Mr. Young --       -- as I understand, the union recognizes that a consequence of mootness would be that the Ninth Circuit judgment is vacated.     Now, if the union would also recognize that that means the district court judgment stays in place, so if the Ninth Circuit judgment is worked out and you're left with the district court judgment as the law of the case, then I think it is moot, isn't it?       But it wasn't -- this -- this case is about a completed episode.     It's about a special assessment that is long over.       That's another -- something quite different than the capable of returning to old ways, because here we do have a discrete episode that's over.     And there was no question that, even though that -- what was it, in 2005 -- that the period in 2005-2006, when the special assessment was in effect, that was long over, but you were -- you were continuing to litigate it.     And nobody suggested that it would become moot simply because the period was over.       Well, they said that it had become moot because they gave you all the relief you requested; so, there was nothing left to the case.
10-114 +++$+++        Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew that, though, from day one.     This case is brought in State court, it's removed to Federal court.     Ultimately the plaintiff says:     I recognize that as a matter of law my 1983 claim is no good.     But the plaintiff didn't say that until 18 months after the -- the transfer.     So doesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for running up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening the Federal court, having discovery in Federal court, instead of saying when defendant removed the case - either dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that point that it had no merit so it's only the State claims. I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff bear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal court for 18 months?       Mr. Rosenkranz, there - there are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because, first, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under cover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary in the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show that Vice was an official policymaker for the city. Those are discrete issues that relate to the 1983 claim but have nothing to do with the extortion/defamation claim.       In other words, you're saying that the lawyer has to keep account of -- now, if I'm going to spend time on "under color of State law," I have to label that and figure the hours for that separately; similarly for whether Vice was an official policymaker, those hours that you are requiring that - instead of saying X number of hours for deposition of witness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?       Mr. Rosenkranz, one - one piece of this you must know the answer, under the Louisiana law we have the extortion, defamation, and emotional distress going forward in Louisiana courts. Does Louisiana follow the American rule so that plaintiff even -- if the plaintiff prevails, there would be no award of fees?
10-1150 +++$+++       Mr. Shapiro, on that 11     question and the question Justice Scalia just raised, 12     the Government, you know, has taken the position that 13     you're under the wrong section.    It's not a question of 14     patentability, but you've used the example of the finger; you said it's obvious.    So, why didn't you raise 16     the sections that the Government says would have been 17     the appropriate ones on the novelty or anticipation of 18     prior art and obviousness?
10-1195 +++$+++       In this -- in this case, 11     could -- could this case have been brought in a small 12     claims court?    Where does it come from?      Could the -- could these      But it's up to -- it's up 19     to the State.      Congress said you bring 25     it according to your law and your rules of procedure. So, the State could make it -- Congress may have been 2     interested in the small claims court, but it certainly 3     didn't limit the States to bringing -- to putting these 4     claims in small claims court.      This goes back to 23     Justice Alito's point --      It's a --      Is it because the FCC 3     once took a position that the action was limited to 4     State courts?
10-1211 +++$+++        As far as going forward is concerned, that's -- that's just the way it is, right?       Could they -- could they -- the person who -- who is here and then the new law is passed -- could that person have petitioned for discretionary relief before traveling?
10-1219 +++$+++        But the Morgan case involved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the would-be patent holder; it was an interference proceeding, wasn't it?       Ms. Anders, one of the problems with, I think, your position, is it sounds very strange to have two proceedings, one where you go directly to the Federal Circuit under 101 -- 141; and then this other one where you go to the district court, where if that's not, as Judge Newman said, a whole new -- whole new game, then why would Congress create two judicial review routes, one in the district court reviewable in the Federal Circuit, the other directly in the Federal Circuit, if there's no difference?     That is, if in both of them, it's not de novo review; it is reviewing what the -- what the agency did under the ordinary standard for reviewing agency action. What's different about the -- the 145 proceeding?       And you were beginning to answer that by saying, well, you can't have oral testimony before the PTO.     But what else?     I asked you what would be -- what's different about 141 and 145 on your view.     And you said one thing is oral testimony. What else?       But you said that you could -- you could go into court on 145 even if you had no new evidence.       So, you do -- in that case, would there be any difference between 141 and 145 other than you go to a different court?
10-1259 +++$+++        There was a third party involved in the telephone -- in the pen register case. And, here, it's the police.     Essentially, I think you answered the question that the government's position would mean that any of us could be monitored whenever we leave our homes.     So, the only thing secure is the home. Is -- I mean, that is -- that is the end point of your argument, that an electronic device, as long as it's not used inside the house, is okay.       Mr. Dreeben, this case started out with a warrant.     There was a warrant, and the limits weren't followed.     The warrant said 10 days, do this in 10 days, and the police took 11.     They were supposed to do it in D.C.     Instead, they did it in Maryland. So, the police could have gotten permission to conduct this search.     In fact, they had received it. Now, I take it that the practice had been, because it's in the electronic surveillance manual, better get a warrant.     Was there any problem about -- when this kind of surveillance is wanted by the government, to get a warrant?     Were they encountering difficulty getting warrants?       And the speed as well.       An easy way to pick someone up for speeding when you suspect something far worse but have no -- no probable cause.       That was -- that is when the police came upon the violator.     But this is -- it's all in a computer.     The police can say we want to find out more about X, so consult the database, see if there's an indication that he was ever speeding in the last 28 days.       But the Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable searches and seizures. And if I were trying to explain to someone, here's the Fourth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment says -- or it has been interpreted to mean that if I'm on a public bus and the police want to feel my luggage, that's a violation; and yet, this kind of monitoring, installing the GPS and monitoring the person's movement whenever they are outside their house in the car, is not?     I mean, it just -- something about it that -- just doesn't parse.       Who would be under your test the judge of the reasonable suspicion?
10-1261 +++$+++       On your first point, you 13     cite Lampf, but Lampf had two limits.    So, it said -- 14     what was it, 1 year from whatever, from discovery.    And 15     then it set an outer limit at 3 years, and it was the 16     same thing in Merck.    Here we just say -- it just has 17     what seems to me a plain vanilla statute of limitations 18     that is traditionally subject to waiver, equitable 19     tolling.    We don't have that special kind of statute 20     that gives you one limit and then sets a further limit 21     that will be the outer limit.      The problem is it reads 10     like dozens of statutes of limitations.    It says no suit 11     more than 2 years and that -- I think that the general 12     understanding is that that limitation, that kind of 13     limitation -- there is a presumption that it is subject 14     to equitable tolling, forfeiture, waiver.    And why, if 15     this one doesn't use any different words, why should -- 16                 MR. LANDAU stand-alone statute.    It was enacted as part of the '34 19     Act.    And so, I think you -- the same Congress that set 20     a hard outer limit of repose for fraud claims in section 21     9(e) and 18(c) wouldn't have wanted with respect to this 22     prophylactic provision that it is, by definition, both 23     under- and over-inclusive.    It may be --      Well, it's -- it's not 16     simply a prophylactic.    I mean, there's an objective 17     that 16(a) expresses; that is, Congress wanted these 18     trades to be reported and to have the form filed, Form 4 19     filed.    So, it's a -- it's a disclosure-forcing provision, 16(a) is.    Then, why would Congress mean for 21     it to operate to immunize a defendant who has not made 22     that filing and who has concealed what was supposed to 23     be reported in 16 -- under 16(a)?
10-1265 +++$+++       But this petition had 13     something new, the report that his investigator had 14     turned up this evidence.      Well, suppose -- suppose 24     the public defender had said to the district court what 25     it said to the Ninth Circuit, and that is that the attorney-client relationship has broken down to such an 2     extent that substitution would be appropriate, what 3     wasn't asked, but suppose the public defender had given 4     that answer to the district judge.    Would the district 5     judge still have rightly denied the motion for 6     substitution?      But it's all -- it's all 23     that, what -- what he told his girlfriend, right? 24     There's nothing else.    It's only that?
10-1293 +++$+++        General Verrilli, I took it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that the major objection is that one cannot tell what's indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, that's saying "Private Ryan" is okay, "Schindler's List" is okay, but "NYPD Blue" is not.     And I do think that that is the major objection, that we have a government agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity is okay and when it isn't.     You can't do it in terms of time because "New York" -- the "NYPD" was 7 seconds and another broadcast, "Catch-22," was 40 seconds. So, it's -- it's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations.     That I think is the major flaw.       Well, I'm not so sure because the examples were given of -- I guess excerpts from "Private Ryan" and from "Schindler's List" have been on television.       If they did an excerpt from "Hair," could they televise that?       In the -- in the opera, in "The Makropulos Case," there's a scene where a woman is seen nude entering a bathtub.     And suppose that were shown, that scene from the opera.       You hear them on the street.       But you -- you are saying that the standard can still be symbolic, as Justice Scalia said.     We want the King's English when -- the very children we're talking about, when they go on the street, when they -- their big brother says something to them, it is -- the words that were -- the expletives are in common parlance today.     I mean, it is -- I think that children -- that children are not going to be shocked by them the way they might have been a generation ago.       Even though the Justices involved said this is a narrow decision, both Justice Stevens and Justice Powell.       And on the other side, you'd better be careful about calling certain people, certain artists to be interviewed because, even though it's unscripted, there's always a risk they're going to say something they shouldn't say.
10-1320 +++$+++        Is that -- is that altogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she first say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge?       But then they went -- then they went out again.       And that's the problem. They, the jury -- the judge gave them an Allen charge, and they went out again.     And I think you have recognized that the jury could have then said we'll go back to square one, we'll consider capital murder, first-degree murder. So, they -- I think you recognize that after the judge gives them a charge of this kind, they can begin all over again.     And here, when they came in and said we -- we can't agree, defense counsel didn't ask to have the jury polled.
10-1399 +++$+++        What happens in the case --       And the -- and the critical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most compensation payments are the -- are as a result of voluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding?       So -- and then in those cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily make this compensation available, then measuring -- the -- the pay would be measured by the time the employer makes -- makes the compensation available, right?       But there's no award.       But we have -- what is -- I mean, there can be.     But here's a person who has been injured and gets compensation without having to bring any legal proceeding for it.     What is the weekly -- the measure then?     It can't be an award, the date of the award, because there is no award.     So, what is it?
10-1472 +++$+++        What of the document that's -- that's read out in open court and it's a document, a contract, in another language, and the interpreter -- the witness presents the document, and the interpreter interprets it?       Well, what if the -- if the interpreter, being diligent, said I'm going to have to translate this document in open court, I'd like to have it in advance so I can be sure that my translation is going to be accurate?     So that in fact the interpreter looks at the document and, in -- in preparation for the trial, translates it.       What about depositions? The -- the translation would be of the spoken word, but it wouldn't be in court.
10-1491 +++$+++        Mr. Hoffman --       Mr. Hoffman, I -- I thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil liability on corporations for violations of customary international law, where the conduct occurred abroad, the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not a U.S. resident?       That sounds --       That sounds very much like Filartiga.     And I thought that -- that Sosa accepted that Filartiga would be a viable action under the Tort Claims Act.     So, I thought what we were talking about today, the question was, is it only individual defendants or are corporate defendants also liable?
10-1542 +++$+++        What about -- there was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile -- a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the child's?       Does a child who is not emancipated have the capacity to independently establish a residence?       If the supposition -- if the supposition is that the parents -- I think Justice Breyer's supposition was that both parents were LPRs.     The likelihood of the 6-month-old child being born in the United States and therefore being a citizen would be rather large.       They do say --
10-174 +++$+++        If you have -- if you have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough.     So if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts had standing.       I thought your -- your first argument when you addressed this issue was there is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA.     So you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would be if it was within the court's bailiwick.     I thought your position was that the function, this regulatory function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the courts.       EPA couldn't give - could EPA give that relief?     We're dealing with existing stationary sources.     We're not dealing with new or modified sources.       More than that, Newdow was a case of a father trying to assert a right on behalf of a child, and the child herself did not want that right nor did her mother.     So it seems to me it's worlds apart, and when you describe prudential standing as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the generalized grievance was Article III.     I thought that's what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a grievance that she shared with everybody in the populations, so she didn't have standing.       To that extent you disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no Article III?       Can we get to -- to the situation that now exists?     They are seeking standards for existing sources.     I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you agree with him, this is not a -- this is not a new source or a modified source; we're talking about existing sources.     Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set standards for existing sources?       It's not an area where the Court can't go.     To take a political question we all agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court does deal with the subject matter all the time.     It reviews decisions that the EPA has made.
10-179 +++$+++        Mr. Richland, isn't there this difference:     Just to take ordinary civil procedure, compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under the wing of the main claim, but a permissive counterclaim has to independently satisfy a jurisdictional requirement. So that could be a reason, even though the Bankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish the two.     If there's an authority to deal with the claim, then there's authority to deal with the counterclaim, but if it's a permissive counterclaim, it's not based on the same transaction or premise, then it would have to be a self-standing claim.     But, as you -- as you have said, this case does present what the parties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.       And the counterclaim came at what point?     After the proof of claim was filed?       Will you include in that this 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a futile exercise if that tort claim comes -- comes out of the bankruptcy judge's -       Does the Government have a position on what the answer would be?     We've remanded it, but that's an open question.     But does the Government have a position on whether these kinds of claims would have to be heard by an Article III judge?
10-188 +++$+++        But suppose the FOIA information is just to confirm, to back up, to fill out; that the -- the relator suspects there's a fraud going on, and he thinks that the -- the fraud will be documented by filings that the alleged fraudulent party has made in the government.       Yes.       So in each case, we'd have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was it so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the FOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of the -       If I -- if I submitted, as we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure statements to an administrative office, and then someone from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then become -- does it become the report of the administrative office, rather than my report to the administrative office?       So there's no difference between a report -- the government has an investigating commission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the many government agencies that are just repositories? They accept pieces of paper, reports, filed by other people, like a tax return, like a financial disclosure. The agency does nothing, has no input. I mean, there's surely different between those two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural understanding would be it's a report by the person who's filing it to the agency; and the other, where the agency puts personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of the agency.     And you seem to say, no, they're all reports of the agency.       Let's take this very case -       I'm asking you isn't there a difference between saying we want the raw filings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the government to do any investigations, we want them to do just the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and an agency saying we're going to investigate and make a report, we're going to put our people under the investigators, and we're going to interview witnesses, they're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll make a report? That's how I understand a government report. But it's very hard for me to understand how a report by Schindler becomes a government report simply because it is filed with the agency.       We'll find out from them if that is what they have set their position.     I had not read them to say that.     I read them to say only -- to challenge your position that every FOIA response is necessarily a report for purposes of the False Claims Act.       If you request a report, then you get a report.
10-209 +++$+++        When you say no violation, you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel?     I thought that was conceded, that there was ineffective assistance.       Suppose the defective advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he would not have entered if he had been properly advised. Can he get relief?       So, explain why defective advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective advice causing defendant to turn down a plea --       -- does not?
10-218 +++$+++       Could it have intervened 9     somehow, because the -- the United States has come here 10     rather reluctantly, as you recommended against granting 11     cert in this case.    When this was in the Montana courts 12     and it was a question of what is the Federal law, 13     because Federal law is going to control -- everybody 14     agrees that -- could the United States have come into 15     the proceedings in the Montana State court?      And if we -- if it were 10     remanded, the United States would still stay out of it 11     because it's going to be in the State --
10-224 +++$+++        So, is there anything saved to the State?     I mean, there is a savings clause. Once you get to the entrance to the slaughterhouse, is there any room for any State regulation?
10-235 +++$+++        It also said that there's a relaxed standard of causation.     I think that's what Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate cause light."     But we have said in more than one case that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA cases.     Was that wrong?       It has nothing to do with the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases where the message of this Court seemed to be quite clear, FELA cases go to juries?     There are a number of cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just that.       Well, what -- can you explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the words of the statute, and they are also the words used in the model Federal instruction:     Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence? You would say:     Was plaintiff's injury proximately caused.     And as you no doubt know, Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause," it just loses juries.     So considering that these cases go to the jury, what do you say to the instruction that's now given, based on the words of the statute, "Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or part from the railroad's negligence"?     What should the judge charge instead of that?       Well, maybe explain the difference.     I mean, you were answering my question, and I asked how would you tell the jury?     You said it's okay to say:     Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must say something more.     So what is the something more?       Natural, probable, and foreseeable?       Could you give some examples of what causes would be proximate and what causes would not so qualify?     Something that's -- you said but-for is no good.     So what would be a but-for cause but not a proximate cause?       And the spelling out is natural, probable, and foreseeable?       Are there any -- any negligence-type statutes?     I mean this one, I mean, it's odd to say that the judge erred in reading to the jury the words of the statute, did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in part from railroad negligence.     All that Federal statutes, negligence statutes that use the word "proximate" -       But you said your defense at trial was not about causation, it was no negligence, right?
10-238 +++$+++        Mr. Maurer, you -- you don't have any objection, you wouldn't have any objection, if Arizona trebled the amount at the outset? In other words, there was a maximum amount, the so-called matching funds; if it were given all in one lump and the publicly funded candidate was told, give it back if you don't use it, that would be okay?       How about not under Buckley?       I thought that the point of Buckley was that the public funding, which you can accept or reject, the justification for it was that it increased rather than decreased speech.     And the -- I think you were quite right in recognizing that matching funds, this Court has said, do not conflict with the - with the First Amendment.       Not matching funds. Public funding.       Public funding.     And so if it turns out that the States -- public funding isn't being used because -- because the limits are low, and yet the, the State wants to conserve the public fisc. So instead of just increasing the amount at the outset, it says the -- the -- the object is the same, but we're economizing by not giving it out in one lump sum, we're giving it out in installments.       What about all the background, there had been a number of scandals in Arizona, there had been vote buying?     I thought that that was part of the origin of this law, was not as you now say had nothing to do with corruption.     I thought it emerged out of that, those startling incidents of people actually selling their votes.
10-277 +++$+++        Did -       Is there any responsibility if you -- the numbers are what has been left out so far.     The company gets reports month after month showing that women are disproportionately passed over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men and women doing the same job.     It happens not once, but twice.     Isn't there some responsibility on the company to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is, isn't there an obligation to stop it?       Mr. Boutrous, there was a case, it was in the '70s, and it was a class action against AT&T for, I think, promotion into middle management.     What was at issue there was a part -- a test, part objective, but then in the end, the final step was a so-called total person test, and women disproportionately flunked at that total person. And the idea wasn't at all complicated.     It was that most people prefer themselves; and so, a decisionmaker, all other things being equal, would prefer someone that looked like him.     And that was found, that total -- the application of that total person concept was found to be a violation of Title VII. This sounds quite similar.     I mean, it's not just -- it's not subjective.     You have an expert -- I know you have some questions about that expert -- but the expert saying that gender bias can creep into a system like that simply because of the natural phenomenon that people tend to feel comfortable with people like themselves.       I thought that -- correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that this district judge said that -- that the absent class members would get notice and have an opportunity to -- to opt out.     So, a -- a plaintiff, a member of the class who wants to go for compensation instead of just back pay could opt out.
10-290 +++$+++        It would be hard to argue, Mr. Hungar, that it makes no sense, but it made sense to Cardozo and Judge Rich.       But just taking RCA itself, Cardozo said through all the verbal variances there runs this common core of thought and truth, that one otherwise an infringer who assails the validity of a patent bears -- upon its face, bears a heavy burden of persuasion and fails unless his evidence has more than a dubious preponderance.       Then you -- then you have to be saying that Judge Rich got it wrong because he does deal with the -       It's -- it -- it is true that the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since almost the beginning, since that court came on the scene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent cases since 1984.     Because the -- the Federal Circuit has consistently taken this position, one would have expected that there would have been bills proposed to change it.     Were there any?       Mr. Hungar, could we go back to the statute that was enacted in 1952.     Before that the burden of proof on the issue of validity of the patent or the effect of the patent, that was on the challenger.     So when Congress added a presumption of validity, it must have had in mind something more than the defendant would have the burden of proof and the normal standard is preponderance.     So by adding a presumption of validity, must Congress have intended to do something more than simply repeat that the defendant has the burden of proof?
10-313 +++$+++        Doesn't it say something about feasible?     It -- it doesn't -- it doesn't give free choice entirely.     It says -- what are the words? That the -- the interconnection doesn't have to be put just anyplace if it's not feasible or it's undue expense or something to that effect.       That's why it's only technically feasible, because the economic burden is -- is not on the company.     It has to provide it at the place if it's technically feasible, but it doesn't pay for it.       Mr. Miller, would you, before you sit down, explain what is the Government's position when an agency is asked to file a brief?     The Sixth Circuit asked -- invited the FCC to file a brief, it did, and then the Sixth Circuit disagreed.     And there was some suggestion that when an agency files a brief here in this Court, as opposed to a court of appeals, it deserves more weight.
10-382 +++$+++        Mr. Shah, you might want to make your third point.     You said you had three points preliminarily, so why don't you make your third point and then respond to the question.       Mr. Shah, you don't have to take a position on that, because you don't represent a private trustee.     And the government can accept arguendo that there would be such a relationship, but I don't think you have to defend it.       Mr. Shah -       Is one -- is one of them shielding government actors?     I mean, from what you said so far, on the one hand you recognize that it is what we call a guardian, the guardian-ward relationship between the United States and the tribe.     But what you seem to be suggesting is that the government has a dual focus, and one is its guardianship relation to the tribe, but the other is these are government actors and the government is also interested in shielding its actors. Is that -- is that it or is it a more nebulous interest?       How many -- how many of these mismanagement suits are there?     Do you have any estimate?
10-444 +++$+++        Well, the open -- the open plea that was made -- that's a critical stage.     In fact, he took a plea.     But he, I think, has a plausible argument that the plea he made, the open plea with no bargain in the picture, that that plea was not intelligently made because he didn't know that there had been an offer for him to plead to a misdemeanor rather than a felony.       Yes.       Mr. Yang, in your view, is there any situation in which a defendant could regain a plea opportunity that he lost due to counsel's conceded inadequacy?     And I think it is accepted that not telling him of the plea offer was ineffective representation.     Is there any case where the defendant could regain the plea opportunity that he lost?       Yes.     If he doesn't seek a trial, right.       Yes.     If he doesn't want to go to trial and he's going to plead guilty, is there any circumstance where he could regain that lost opportunity?
10-507 +++$+++        How many accountants go to platforms?       But if that -- if that's what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is this person one who regularly works on the outer continental shelf.     And the -- this worker, we're told, was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the time.       I thought your brief, your reply brief, said you -- you superimpose a status test.     You have the situs of the injury, and then you superimpose status.     So, your test is not simple state of -- place of injury.       Mr. Clement, if your position is right, then we have a worker who most of the time is doing work on a platform, and he will be covered or not depending on whether the injury occurred on the shelf or on the land.     So, it's -- the other view is to say what this person does most of the time is what counts.     Then this worker would always be covered by OCSLA.     And if you take your view, then one will be covered by OCSLA; another one who is doing the same job is covered by a State -- a State -- you have a variety of State workers' compensation laws as opposed to a uniform law governing workers of this kind.       Mr. Clement, may I go back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury.       But Congress also did not adopt the proposal, the specific proposal to confine OCSLA to situations in which State workers' compensation was unavailable.       But why -- why doesn't Congress know?     Because I think States overwhelmingly would include outer continental shelf workers in their compensation scheme.       It would make sense to use the Longshore Act because they wanted to have the same level of compensation.       No.     No, no. They wanted the OCSLA worker to have the same benefits as the longshore worker.
10-5258 +++$+++        Mr. Gordon, the State does regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this defendant because it's made a -- made the change not retroactive.     So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for Mr. MCNeill, and all others who committed the offense prior to the change in law.     So it is -- it is the State's current position that for this offense the maximum is 10 years.       Mis -       Mr. Gordon, is this -- is this essentially an academic question?     Because this district judge said that he would impose the same sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect calculation.     He said:     This criminal record is violent and astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the book at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if that's no -- if there's no other way. So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if your -- your client would end up in the same place?       I'm -- I'm not sure what you're urging now.     Are -- are you modifying or retracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor, that is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but then at the time of the Federal offense the State has changed it so it's 10 years? I -- I think you answered her question that it would work the same way, that what mattered is how the State currently ranks the offense, not the offender. But now you seem to be saying there might be a different answer when the State increases rather than decreases the penalty.
10-5400 +++$+++        But it is strange, isn't it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for the supervised release.     I mean, that -- that's a provision, isn't it?     As far as supervised release is concerned, the judge can take account of rehabilitation in setting the length of the term, but can't do that for the prison time.       Well, how do we -       -- can we know that when the government -- didn't the government ask for 63 months?       And the judge came up with something in between those two?
10-5443 +++$+++        Suppose the -- suppose the prosecutor argued a realistic prospect there.     When Gamble confessed, he confessed to the local police, and they immediately communicated that information to the Federal prosecutors.     So, if that's what the government counsel argues, wouldn't that be a realistic prospect - wouldn't they likely have done the same thing with respect to Fowler that they did with respect to Gamble?       Was -- what was the time sequence?     How much after Gamble came to the local police did the local police go to the -       Several years after 2002?       What's delicate about robbery?     I mean, robbery is completely a Federal crime, and that was what the -- that was what Horner observed, and they were -- they were planning for the robbery the next day.
10-545 +++$+++        You said that Congress can set a time limit.     In this case, we're dealing with, let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of copyright, and Congress says:     No, we think Shostakovich should be treated just like Copeland.     Yes, we took care of our own when we weren't part of the world community, but now we are. And so, all that Congress is doing is giving Shostakovich works the same limited time as Aaron Copeland.     And why does that violate the limited-time prescription?       But the person -- the person we're talking about, the work we're talking about, never got the first limit.     There was no -- there was no time, there was no time when that work could have been protected.     So, why isn't it consistent with the Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited time protection?     We're not talking about a case where you've had the protection, enjoyed it, and then it expired, and then Congress says we'd like -- we like your work so much we're going to give you another term. What's affected here are people who were unprotected.     And Congress says we think that they should have a limited time.       They didn't get the equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the large category, because it's the ones that you feature. You're talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I say, well, what's wrong with giving them the same time that Aaron Copeland got?       That's not a limited time.     That's saying you have no time.       But it has to have a beginning, too.     And that's -- for these people who were unprotected, because we didn't recognize their copyright, there's no beginning.       I can understand your argument that the public domain is untouchable.     I'm not sure I get that from the Constitution.     That says to secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive right.     That -- that's talking about what you can secure to authors.     So, I don't see why using the words of the Constitution, to secure to authors for a limited time, Congress can't say:     We want every author to have a limited time.       The foreign works that we didn't give -- we're not treating them any better.     They don't get a different startup date, but they get the same end date as our own authors.       We're not talking about expiration dates.     So, I'd like you to concentrate --       That's not -- that's not -- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been extended beyond their expiration date.     They just weren't protected.       But is it -- that is -- that is not --       That is most distinctly not before this case.     So, please let's not talk about a copyright that has been protected, has expired, and Congress wants to revive it. We are concentrating on what Congress did to bring us into compliance with the worldwide system, and it's saying:     We're giving a limited time to these authors.       They never had a limited time before.       Did anyone in the same -- the same -- published the same year as De Tocqueville, a U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection today?       I gave the example of Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich.     Let's go back to De Tocqueville.     Who has a copyright who published in, what, 18 -- what was it?       Yes.       I think you gave an analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you were quite right about that.     You can extend the statute of limitations before it's expired, but once it's expired, it's over. The problem with you using that as an analogy is that there was a beginning.     Time ran out, and you're trying to deal with a situation here where you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S. work, but it's unlimited, that you -- you cannot treat the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time, the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work. You're saying these people had no time, and they may never get time.       But it isn't -- it isn't quite --       -- quite so because there are these examples of the people who couldn't get copyright because of wartime both after -- after both World War I and World War II, and -- so, those people were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't get because of the war.       At the time we joined Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the article 18 issue.     There wasn't any -- anyone who said that we satisfied it.       Well, there were many people who read article 18 in a different way, and Congress was later persuaded that that was right.       They -- they found that compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to become a full member of the international copyright community.       All this rides on accepting your argument that zero is a limited time.       Would you say it was would required by TRIPS?       Is it not so that if we don't comply with Berne 18, then we are subject to being sanctioned by some World Trade Organization --
10-553 +++$+++        Mr. Laycock, would you clarify one point?     You say the church decides who's qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister, and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the officials to other parishes to be a commissioned minister.     So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any interferences with who is qualified to be a minister, because the church was holding her out as being qualified.       But I thought your position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes the class to chapel.     I'm -- I take it the Chief is asking for somebody in this -- that you categorize as a minister, although mostly she's a math teacher.     You would say the extent of her religious duties don't matter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a minister.       I thought that it was part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute that what she did, her duties at the school, did not change from when she was a contract teacher, and therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing at the school is the very same thing.     And I thought that was the basis for the -- the decision that we're reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what she did before she was commissioned and after she was commissioned.       But you're isolating one parish, but there was something in one of these briefs that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran schools -- let's see where it was.     I think it was --       Is it -- is it in the handbook?     I mean, one of the objections -- if this -- if this is a rule that's going to bind the teachers, then you would expect to find it in the handbook.     But the handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the EEOC about discrimination, then you will be fired.       Mr. Laycock, you, in order, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is permitted, in your reply brief you say there are many suits that could be brought that would not be inappropriate.     And I think it's on page 20 of your reply brief.     But I don't understand how those would work if the policy is you're a minister; if you have quarrels with the church or a co-worker, we have our own dispute resolution, and you don't go outside. But you say tort arising from unsafe working conditions.     Suppose one of these commissioned workers said, I think that there are unsafe working conditions and I'm going to complain to the Occupational Health and Safety Agency.     And wouldn't she get the same answer: This has to be solved in-house.     You don't go to an agency of the state. Why -- I don't follow why the tort claim based on unsafe working conditions would not fall under the same ban on -- keeping disputes in-house?       But I thought the reason that she was unfit for the ministry was that she went outside the house.       But she could -- she could be -- for any of these things, she could be disciplined, fired because she complained outside the house.       The tort claim could proceed, and then she would get damages, and that would be all right?       Did you say -- did I understand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor and Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a contract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion classes would be enough for her to qualify for the ministerial exception?       Is the clincher in this case, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a commissioned minister, she's teaching the faith; therefore, she can be fired, and it doesn't matter whether she's commissioned.     So, the commission is irrelevant.     It's -- it's her job duties that count.       Now, it was certainly for some purposes.     I mean, if every teacher who teaches religion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a minister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on my income tax return, certainly that's something that a government agent would review.
10-568 +++$+++        As I understand the objection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but it's to the vagueness of this particular one.     As I understand it, there's no concern about the specific categories that were mentioned, like family member or employer.       So we're dealing not with can you have recusal rules.     Everybody believes, yes, you can.     It's the degree of specificity.       But not in this context. And you don't disagree that -- I forgot which brief told us that there's no State has a similar catch-all.       Is there a way to get advice as to -- I think you said he went to the county attorney, he could have gone to -- to the ethics commission, and they were told ethics commissions can give advice only after the -- is in office, they don't give -- they are not obliged to give advice to candidates.     So when Carrigan is running he apparently has no access to the ethics commission?
10-577 +++$+++        Mr. Whalen, the common definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a false impression, intentionally giving a false impression with the intent that someone will act on it. So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return is.     You give a false impression of what your income is with the intent that the IRS will accept it.       But why isn't it obvious? What proof would you need?     You submit a document because you want to convey a false impression for someone to act on.     Why do you have to have anything more than that to establish deceit?       Do we have that in the briefs?       But the point that was being made is not that it's fraud and deceit.     Quite the opposite.     I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading payment where you say nothing.     What would be the crime if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a return, so you are not filing anything that's false? Where would that come in the Internal Revenue --       Would it be evasion simply not to report your income?       Although it's not a criminal statute?       It's not a criminal statute.       There -- there's one technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand. The particular tax here in question, the failure to report was 76-some thousand dollars, but the number that was given for the total failure to report is over 1 million, and the -- the loss to the IRS at -- is 245,000.     Well, the 245,000 loss must refer to more than the failure to report 76,000.       I'd just like to know how we got -- how the 245,000 revenue loss was calculated, given that the crime that was charged, the failure was to report only 76,000?
10-6 +++$+++        You said that the particular patent -- the defendant would have to know that the device infringed the particular patent.     I think that would be a standard that would be impossible to meet.     We have to know if it was patent number, whatever it was, '312.       But you can keep yourself ignorant of it.     I mean, for example, you pointed out that the -- that the device that was copied was purchased in Hong Kong, so it didn't have any marking, but the same Pentalpha could have bought the device in Montgomery Ward, looked to see if it had a patent marking; didn't do that.       But didn't tell that patent attorney that they had reverse-engineered a particular product.     If the attorney had been told this device copied the SEB fryer, isn't it 99 and 44/100ths percent sure that the attorney then would have found this patent?       But I didn't ask you about this patent search.     I said if they had told the patent attorney we have copied a particular fryer, it's SEB's fryer, now find out if it infringed any patent - do you think an attorney would not have found the SEB patent?       But if you really wanted to know, wouldn't you have gone into Montgomery Ward and bought one of the fryers and turned it around to see if it had a patent number on it?       But isn't -- isn't it true that Sunbeam was the party that asked for the patent search?       And there's nothing in the record that says who -- who asked Pentalpha -       -- to get -- to get a letter?       Before -- before you pass that question, then why as in '607 did they pick the SEB fryer to reverse-engineer?       And then they copied the design of the SEB.       But there was a finding that it was an infringement, that the Pentalpha fryer infringed the SEB.       And after that date you admit you -- because you continued to sell the product to the retailers?       So after Sunbeam sued, then you are actively inducing infringement?       I thought that opinion was after the first finding of infringement, that you redesigned the product and that, the evidence you got dealt with the redesigned products.       But after just originally, Sunbeam is suing for infringement.     Sunbeam notifies Pentalpha.     At that point, Pentalpha is continuing to make sales.     Is it infringing?     Is it actively inducing infringement.       You admitted there was purposeful, culpable conduct when you did not, when you had the original design and that was, and you were sued for actively inducing infringement of that design, by that design.       But you think a jury could have found that from the facts?
10-63 +++$+++        Disclaimed to who?     To -- I mean, how could a clerk be expected to know that the local counsel really isn't taking any part?     I mean -- so was the disclaimer to the clerk?       You said that even before that.     In the rule -- you said the Rule 32 -- didn't you say something about -- the -- the notice that went from the prosecutor to Maples did not go to the local counsel, right?       Did the -- did the prosecutor -- I'm not talking about the clerk now.     The prosecutor had a filing in connection with the Rule 32 motion.     Did the prosecutor send that to, well, everybody?     Maples and everybody?       But you seem not to rely on what the State as prosecutor did.     It seemed to me the State as prosecutor was recognizing that Maples had no counsel; therefore, sent -- said you'd better file your habeas; this is how much time you have -- sent it just to him.       But in the -- in the practice of a law firm, these were very junior people. Wouldn't the law firm have to have some involvement in giving them permission to provide this representation? I mean, usually there's something like a pro bono committee and a higher level.     Can -- can such junior associates just go ahead and say, we want to spend a lot of our time defending a man on death row?     Wouldn't they have to get some kind of permission?       We do know, though, that they were not counsel of record.       So, we know that the two who were listed as counsel of record --       -- were not representing him, and they hadn't told the court.
10-637 +++$+++        But Respondents said you could.       Respondents in their brief said that if you had sought postconviction relief in the State courts, then you could have argued Gray was the controlling decision, and they would have accepted that Gray --       Well, apparently the Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought that he hadn't properly raised it.     I mean, they initially granted review post-Gray, and then they found that the grant was improvident most likely because Greene had not raised the -- the Gray issue below.       Not as of the date they made it.       Why?       Because the statute says adjudication resulted in a decision.     And the decision, the only decision, is the Pennsylvania Superior Court, because there was a non-decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.     Resulted -- that is -- in a decision that was.     It didn't say "is." I mean, you would have a much stronger argument if it had read "resulted in a decision that is contrary."     But when it says "was," that sounds like at the time of the adjudication.       Mr. Fisher, what about the -- well, the purpose of AEDPA was to require the Federal courts to respect the State courts' decision. And there's only been one decision in this picture, and that decision was the Pennsylvania Superior Court.     And we are not giving much respect to that decision, which did not have the benefit of Gray, if we're going to say, no, we have to look at that decision as though Gray were already on the books.       Well, I don't -- I don't understand the problem.     If you look at the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision and say, as of that time, the -- there was no violation of any clearly established law, period.     Why is that complicated?
10-6549 +++$+++        Well, maybe -- maybe the Attorney General doesn't have that power.     But your position is that whether this behavior, not registering, is criminal or not is left up to the Attorney General, is left up to the executive.     Do we have other examples where Congress says, well, we don't know whether this should be a criminal offense; so, we're going to leave it to the Attorney General? It's quite different to say the Attorney General will implement it in the technical details, but to say that whether it's a criminal offense or not is up to the Attorney General -- is there any other instance where that's so?       But are you -- now -- now we do -- the Attorney General has spoken.     The first time, you say it was ineffective because there was no notice and comment.     But from -- what is it -- August of 1908, we have a rule, a final rule, that did go through notice and comment.     So, are we talking about, is this case simply about the period from February 1907 to August 1908, and that's -- that's all that's involved in this case, only those people?     Or are you contesting that after August 1908, you still have some kind of claim?       So, it's -- so, this whole case is about what happens between February '07 and August '08, and that's the limit of it.       Because there was no rule at all before February '07, and there was a rule August '08.     So, it's just that period this case is about.       But what -- but what you're challenging is interim rule, because there was no notice and comment.     So, you would have had no challenge, not from the date of SORNA's enactment, but from the date of the rule that you're challenging -- and that rule was February '07.     Your challenge is to the invalidity of the interim rule, right?       Okay.     So -- but before there was an interim rule, you would have no such challenge.       You might have some other case, but this case is about a challenge to a rule as invalid.     Is that -- that's as I understand it.     So, there had to be the rule for you to make the challenge.       You are challenging the Attorney General's first rule as invalid, the February '07 rule.       You say it's invalid because there was no notice and comment.     You have no challenge -- your challenge doesn't reach before that, because there was no rule before that so that you can - the earliest point is when the rule was adopted, you're saying, the rule was invalid.     So, that's why I said the brackets are from when there was an allegedly invalid rule, which was in February '07, until when there's a valid rule, which is in August of '08.       Well, take this case. What would compliance entail other than simply telling the Missouri authority -- I mean, he had to register, was registered in Missouri -- telling the Missouri authority that he was moving to another State?     That's all he had to do, right, to comply?       To comply with the -- the SORNA requirement, that he'd have to tell the Missouri authority that he was moving to another State.     And then Missouri would have an obligation to tell that other State he's there.       But I'm talking about SORNA has been enacted, and now he's moving after SORNA is enacted, right?       Okay.     So -- so, SORNA is on the books.     He's registered in Missouri.     He's leaving the State.     To comply with SORNA, what does he have to do other than tell the original State, I'm moving to another State?       But he can't -- he can't comply with the initial registration because he committed this crime even before SORNA was enacted.       But now, what would he have to do to be in compliance?       Under the current regulation, under the 19 -- I mean, the '08 regulations, would it be enough to comply -- for somebody in his situation, to comply simply by telling his parole officer, I'm moving to the other State?     Under the regulation that says how this is implemented?       That was the answer that you gave to my question, which was the same thing:     Why isn't it sufficient now for him simply to tell his parole officer he's moving?
10-680 +++$+++        Why is a per se rule necessarily what is being argued here?     For one thing, he had no choice but to go with the police, right?       So, it's different from some cases where the prisoner initiates the conversation.       And it doesn't make any difference that they -- they took him from his cell, he was under compulsion to leave with them and interrogated during the hours when prisoners are ordinarily sleeping?       If he were out and the police officer said, come along with us, he could say no.     But here he didn't -- he didn't have that choice.       Is it -- is the time relevant, that this was done -- they took him away at 7:00 in the evening and kept him for 7 hours?       Well, they -- that didn't do him any good, because he couldn't get back to his cell without being escorted there.
10-694 +++$+++        And the violent felony - the violent felony in this case, he had a suspended sentence, didn't he?       When you say a sharp change, I think that this is a very confusing set of decisions.     And the Wadud case that was brought up before has a footnote that says that -- that the board had stated a waiver of inadmissibility may be granted in deportation if the alien was excludable as a result of the same facts.     And then that footnote ends:     "We shall withdraw from that language in each of these cases."       What about the comparability of the crime involved in St. Cyr?     That was a drug offense.     Does the inadmissibility criterion -- does that accord with the one for deportation?       So that -- there the linguistic comparison works, right?
10-699 +++$+++        But you say, Mr. Lewin, that -- you're not claiming exclusivity in Congress. You say foreign relations is a shared power.     So, if it is a shared power, why does Congress trump the executive?       Does that go the full length of saying if Congress passed a law that says the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Jerusalem must be designated as the capital of Israel in all official documents -- suppose that were the law.     I take it, from everything you've argued, your position would be, yes, Congress has that authority.       Not all that old. (Laughter.)       Mr. Lewin, I take it from what you -       What you've argued is that you're skipping over the question that the D.C. Circuit decided.     I take it your view is it's not a political question; so, the Court should resolve the merits.
10-704 +++$+++       So, if you have a gang 11     member and the crime has absolutely nothing to do with 12     gang membership -- that I think is the case here; it's a 13     domestic assault -- as long as you're a gang member, 14     then every warrant can say search for all gang-related 15     information?    That's essentially your position, isn't 16     it?      But you -- you said this 22     is domestic assault.    There is no gang activity involved 23     in that assault, right?      So, anyone who has a 6     weapon and is a member of a gang then can be -- there 7     can be a search for any and all weapons and material 8     related to weapons?      I'm -- I'm on to the part 17     about all gang-related activity, when the crime has 18     nothing to do with the -- with the gang.    Let's -- let's 19     stick to that.    Then guns is another issue.    But this 20     said warrant to search for any and all gang-related 21     items?      What -- what do you need 11     more than here he is with his gun?    The defendant 12     himself and his gun?    I mean, what --      What about the provision 2     for any photographs that depict evidence of criminal 3     activity?    That seems to me as general as you can get. 4     Photographs depicting evidence of criminal activity. 5                 MR. COATES And if I may, I'd like to reserve the 20     balance of my time for rebuttal.      I though the test was "so
10-708 +++$+++       Because she can't -- 22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR      Because she can't prove 2     it at the early stage.    I mean, the problem that 3     Congress was concerned about was that you can't tell 4     until the house is going to be sold in the end how 5     adequate the title insurance was.    So, Congress is acting on the potential that these kind of kickbacks can 7     cause harm.    And this does seem to fit the bill of 8     restitution, unjust enrichment cases, where the      Suppose she -- suppose 6     she appended to her complaint an affidavit by a well-respected economist that says Congress was right; 8     these kind of arrangements will have an adverse effect 9     on the people who are purchasing title insurance.    And 10     goes through all kinds of analyses that show that. 11     Would that be adequate then?
10-76 +++$+++        There's one piece of this I don't quite comprehend.     You -- there's no contest that there is jurisdiction over the parent, right?       So it's -- it's based on consent?       You are met with an argument that it's all one ball of wax.     Parent and sub, they merge; it's one enterprise.     And so if the subs do something any place, the parent is -- it's all part of one thing, so -- and I think that was the principal argument made by the Respondents.       But Perkins is kind of an unusual case, because it was a company that at the time was doing business only in Ohio.     It was a Philippine mining company, and it was World War II, so the mines couldn't be run.     So to the extent that the corporation was existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.       Well, suppose it's just a corporation that's registered to do business in North Carolina, and the connection with that registration - it says:     I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive process for any and all claims.       There is -- there is a country that has this -- what Justice Scalia --     France, in the Civil Code, says that any French citizen can sue anybody on any claim in France.     But we consider that an exorbitant jurisdictional rule.
10-779 +++$+++        Ms. Asay, are any of the other purposes, like for insurance purposes, cases where the pharmacist is paid for giving out the prescriber information?     Here what they call data miners are paying the pharmacists to get this information.     In the case of other, others who have access, do any of them also pay the pharmacists?       Would you clarify -       You answered my question earlier that they don't sell it to anyone else.     That's why I was trying to clarify your answer to Justice Kennedy, because you told me the only sale -- the pharmacists, they sell this to the data miners, they do not sell it to the other people.     But now you're answering Justice Kennedy's question, yes, they sell it to universities.       There's another - there's another purpose that I would like you to comment on, and that is the, the State is interested in promoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly to reduce the sale of brand name drugs.     And if that's the purpose, why doesn't that run up against what this Court has said that you can't, you can't lower the decibel level of one speaker so that another speaker, in this case the generics, can be heard better?       Mr. Kneedler, in most of our commercial speech cases there has been a commodity. Here it's a record maintained by the pharmacist.     We think of a pharmacist as selling the brand name or generic name, but whose list is this?     Whose record is it?     Is it the pharmacist's record the way goods, stock in trade, would be?
10-788 +++$+++        Mr. Pincus, you said -- I think you used the words "the one who motivated the charge" or something to that effect.     And I'm looking at the complaint that was filed in this case, and it says -- and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix. It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or should have known there was no probable cause.     "He," Mr. Hodges, "directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges." So, if anyone was the instigator, it was the prosecutor, not his aide.     But the prosecutor gets absolute immunity.       But if he did it -- if he did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the prime mover.       He -- the instigator, what you call the complaining witness, would have been immune if he gave the identical testimony at the trial itself, right?       It's only -- it's only what you call the complaining witness that gets this special treatment?     All the other witnesses before the grand jury would be absolutely immune?       The question is, where do you locate the grand jury?     We have on the one side, you recited Malley.     That was an arrest warrant, testimony in support of an arrest warrant.     Then we have the trial, where everybody gets absolute immunity.     And grand jury is in between those two.     So, why should we bracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the trial?     The -- the arrest warrant is certainly pre-prosecution.
10-8145 +++$+++        Well, he saw a picture. Boatner saw a picture in a newspaper, and that turned on the light for him, right?     It wasn't any police suggestion.       Wasn't there also an intervening -- didn't he say 5 days after that he couldn't identify?     And that was after what he said on the night, the same night.       Five days later he said I couldn't -- I couldn't identify him.
10-844 +++$+++       Is the first -- is the 23     first approved, the drug itself -- they're not claiming that, because that patent has expired, isn't 25     it?      But what about the fact 8     that the FDA, and not the patent holders, were drafting 9     the use codes at the time this legislation passed? 10                 MR. HURST      Mr. Horwich, do we -- do 3     we know what FDA's position is in this case?    Is the 4     position you're presenting the position of the FDA? 5                 MR. HORWICH story here.
10-8505 +++$+++       In the case of the blood 16     that was tested in the police lab, there the person who 17     was testing did testify at the trial, right?    It wasn't 18     just Lambatos -- Lambatos, but the one who had tested 19     the blood?      Yes.      Mr. Carroll, are we 2     talking about 10 witnesses?    I thought we were talking 3     about just one witness, from Cellmark.      That's 1 person, not 10. 8                 MR. CARROLL
10-875 +++$+++       Is that true of State -- 19     you said taxes.    Is it true of State taxes?      So, in this -- in this -- 24     we're dealing with a capital gains tax on the sale of 25     the farm.    Suppose a State had a similar tax; it also taxed the gain on the sale.      The argument that is made 4     against your position -- 1305 was one of the provisions 5     that was featured, I think, both in the Ninth Circuit 6     and the Tenth Circuit, and their position seems to be 7     that 1305 gives the government an election.
10-879 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick, could you -- could you clarify what is at stake for the worker here?     The railroad worker ordinarily has the FELA claim, but the FELA claim in this case was dismissed. So, can you tell us what recourse -- if you lose, what recovery can this plaintiff get?     And also explain to me why the FELA claim was dismissed.       Can you explain --       Can you explain the difference -- you make a distinction between field pre-emption and conflict pre-emption.     Does that have any practical significance at all in this case, because I thought you agreed that the design defect claim would be barred?       But that was -- that was the Safety Act, and they didn't amend the Locomotive Act.     The Locomotive Act is what it was, and they didn't put that clause in it.
10-895 +++$+++        Ms. Millett, suppose, instead of having the statute broken down into (c)(1), (2), and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one paragraph that says:     You must have a certificate of appealability, and this is what the certificate must contain.     No division into (2) and (3).     Would you still maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph is jurisdictional and the rest is not?       Then that would exclude this case, wouldn't it, because there is a constitutional issue?     It's a speedy trial issue.     But that issue was not reached below, because the case was dismissed as untimely.     So, the only constitutional issue that's in the case is one that couldn't be adjudicated by the court of appeals.     Isn't that right? Is there another constitutional issue other than the speedy trial issue?       It's a little odd that you would identify that issue for the court of appeals when the court of appeals couldn't take it up because it wasn't reached below, because the case was -- was dismissed at an earlier stage.       But it does -- it does suggest, Ms. Millett, that final, two ways -- conclusion of direct review is you've gone up the ladder, and that's it.     And the second part is, well, if you don't go up the ladder, you just stop.     Then when your time to go up the ladder has ended, that's it.     It -- it seems that there are those two possibilities, as Justice Kagan put it so well:     You lose or you quit.       So, you would have a difference between 2255 and 2254.     And on the State level, you would have a variety of times because some States -- they don't all make it the mandate.     They don't set finality at the mandate.     There may be different -- there may be different periods of time before the mandate issues.     So, you would have various time periods for State prisoners.     But if you were a Federal prisoner, then you would have -- there would only be the one --       I'm not talking about a test.     I'm talking about time periods.     There -- there's a uniform time period for 2255 petitions.     There would not be a uniform time period for 2254 petitions.
10-8974 +++$+++        So, at least for all eyewitness testimony, there would have to be some pretesting for reliability; is that -- is that your contention?       And in this case, in which category do you place the eyewitness testimony? Is it police suggestion, or is it suggestive but not through any manipulation on the police's part?       You -- you answered that due process works only in favor of the defendant.       Not in favor of the State.       And that is your only -- your only distinction.     You are saying this is a one -- one-way --       -- street.       Do you distinguish the -- do you distinguish the husband's situation?     He was an eyewitness too, but there was a motion to suppress her testimony.     Is that an example where there's an eyewitness testimony but no suggestiveness?     Why didn't you move to suppress the husband's statement?       So, you'd put them both in the same category?       What about all the -- all the other safeguards that you have?     I mean, you can ask the judge to tell the jury be careful; eyewitness testimony is often unreliable.     You can point that out in cross-examination --       -- ask all those questions.     You can say something about it in your summation to the jury.     And, as Justice Breyer brought up, you have the evidence rule that says if the prejudicial value outweighs probative value, that the judge can say, I'm not going to let it in. Why aren't all those safeguards enough?       Well, leaving aside the police --       -- because, there, there's an interest in deterrence, in deterring the police from manipulating evidence.       It is a difference between --       -- suggestive and suggested by the police.       The -- if the suggestion comes from the police, then the evidence will be excluded.     If the suggestion comes from some place else, unless we change the rules --       -- it would be admitted.
10-930 +++$+++        In which cases would you say the defendant's ability to assist counsel is necessary?     On what issues?     You say that -- that if -- the assistance has to be necessary to a fair adjudication.       In what cases would that be so?       You're talking about a very narrow range of cases because I take it your principal position is it -- it would be unusual that the defendant needs to be competent in order for the lawyer effectively to represent him on habeas.     So under what circumstances do you think competency matters, so that the lawyer should not be expected to go on without a competent client?       Well, why should the --       Why should the Court do that?     Why should it provide any guidance if, as you say, in both of these cases, the review is limited to the record, and we would never get to the question of, if it weren't reviewed, limited to the record, then what?       Opposing counsel said that there is an exception for ineffective assistance of counsel under our decision in Martinez.
10-945 +++$+++        Do you apply the reasonable suspicion rule to all arrestees?     I thought you were making a distinction between felons and less serious offenders.       To do -- to do what?       You just said that strip naked is different from a strip search.       So, what is permitted? There are various things.     One is showering in the presence of officers?       They -- they can be inspected without their clothes; just nothing more than that?       No, I want to know what's permitted.       One, not the other?       But less intrusive than the one -- the search in Bell v. Wolfish, which involved pretrial detainees?       Do we know if the pretrial detainees in Bell were also inspected on entry into the facility?       But you are trying to state the constitutional rule, and you keep talking about what is their rule, and we're trying to find out what are the limits -       -- of the rule, and I think you've already qualified what you said opening. Opening, you said reasonable suspicion is the rule for everyone, the felon as well as the minor offenders.     Now you seem to be saying, well, this case involves only minor offenders; so, let's limit it to that.     That's what I thought you were saying now.       Even for -       -- body lice?       But they are -       May I just ask, on your medical personnel, children in school get inspected for -- for head lice, prisoners for body lice.     You don't need a doctor to do that?       But that's not constitutionally required.       So, that's another thing that -- that you don't need to -- they can inspect for body lice, and that's -- that's okay?       But the Government tells us that that's true only if they don't put the arrestee in the general population.
10-948 +++$+++        Mr. MCConnell, you started with the notion that the disclosure provision in the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if an ordinary person not schooled in the law read "you have a right to sue," wouldn't they understand that to mean I have a right to sue in court?       But the -- the Act in Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as a right within the non-waivable provision.       No, if this were written to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you would have a stronger argument.     But this is meant for consumers, and they read "you have a right to sue, and that right is not waivable."     A right to sue -- they're not going to think about cause of action.     They don't know what cause of action is.     But they do know that a right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit.       Is that in -- is that in the statute?     Or is it just a colloquial --       Yes, but Title VII doesn't say "right to sue."     It's a name that the agency uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute.     The statute doesn't say you have a right to sue.       Except that this is not what the parties decide.     These are take it or leave it contracts.     So, the consumer doesn't really elect arbitration.     It's just presented as part of the terms that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated.       It's a question of whether we take that into account in -- in determining what "you have a right to sue" means.       But you -- but this arbitration agreement precludes class actions, doesn't it?       Well, Mr. Nelson just said no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up settlement as well.     He said that their interpretation does not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff agrees --
10-9646 +++$+++        Mr. Stevenson, but in Roper, the Court also made the point -- when it ruled out the death penalty, it said, "To the extent the juvenile death penalty might have residual deterrent effect, it is worth noting that the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself a severe sanction." So, the Court in Roper seemed to be anticipating this case and suggesting that -- that it was all right, it was constitutional.       Would that satisfy you if the -- if it were not a mandatory term and it was left to the trier, and you could put in all the mitigating circumstances?      Or you could say you reserve that question for another day.       Mr. Stevenson, may I ask you a case -- a question specifically about the Miller case?     There were two boys involved in this horrendous crime.     The older one took a plea and got life with parole.     Was the plea offered to Miller?
10-98 +++$+++        Was Mr. Al-Kidd -- was he released after -- I understand he didn't testify at the trial, and there was an acquittal, and then other charges were dropped.     Was Al-Kidd still in custody as a material witness after the trial was over?       But he was restrained much longer -- for 15 months.       But that's after there is probable cause to suspect that criminal activity has occurred.     And then you -- once you have probable cause, they're not going to look behind probable cause. But, here, the whole reason for using this material witness statute is that there isn't probable cause to believe that al-Kidd did anything.     The violation -- there was no violation of the law.     So Whren is different.     It's a different case.       How does that -       General Katyal, there are some elements of this picture that are very disturbing, and we are talking about the Attorney General and the Attorney General's immunity.     But there are allegations here that this man was kept awake, the lights shining in his cell for 24 hours, kept without clothes.     Now that doesn't sound like the way one would treat someone whose testimony you want.     Is there a remedy that he has for that obvious mistreatment?
10-9995 +++$+++        Well, it is -- it is what the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no, it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to take it up.     If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear -- so, it's a question of which box this case fits into: Is it forfeiture or is it waiver?     And your position is it's waiver.       But you had two opportunities at least to make the argument based on the original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction motion.     You -- you did not raise that.     You were silent twice.       Well, then, I'm confused because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that the question was asked, did you file another postconviction motion?     Answer:     No.
105, Orig. +++$+++                In all those -- in all those cases has the Special Master ever called a court's witness, that is a court's expert, appointed a court's expert, and if so what is the pay rate for such a witness?    I mean, courts of the United States, district courts, occasionally appoint witnesses, court witnesses as distinguished from party's witnesses.                    Do you know if that's happened in Special Master situations?               Do you know whether any other -- you didn't know, in answer to my last question, what the practice had been, but with respect to expert fees in other original jurisdiction cases, has the Court ever deviated from the $40 or when it was $30, $30?                But have they ever approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for the expert witness that deviates from the $40?                Do you know -- do you know whether there were expert witnesses in that case?               Isn't it -- isn't it customary for it to be divided 50/50?                   I mean, we periodically will approve the fees that the special master charges and then they are divided between the parties.   And I thought that they were divided 50/50. Is that not so?              But the Constitution uses the word "judge."    A "judge of the United States" is a Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.
11-10189 +++$+++        Suppose the State's position were not as you accurately have stated the Texas Court of Criminal Appeal.     It didn't say collateral review is the preferred route.     It said either way will do.     You can bring it up on direct appeal, or you can bring it up on collateral. Would you say that Martinez applies in that situation?     Or does it depend on having the -- the State highest court in the matter saying, this is the preferred way to go?       And if it didn't, if it just said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize these limitations because the transcript won't be ready, so you can wait and bring it up on habeas. I'm just asking how far -- the rule that you would like us to adopt -- you say this is just like Martinez.     Is that where you would draw the line, that the -- the State's highest court has to say, we prefer this matter to be brought up on collateral review?       But is your point that he has to have one full and fair opportunity to make the Wiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct Page 11 or collateral?     I think you mentioned that at least one State requires you to do it on direct, but does provide for developing the record.       What are the rules other than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said, in several decisions, the preferred route is collateral review?       Well, if that is the system in Kansas and Michigan, then why -- why is it outside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively present the ineffective assistance counsel when you've got the same counsel who was alleged to have been ineffective and is not going to condemn himself?       Explain why the time that you have on direct appeal isn't adequate.     So you say you need -- need to investigate.     Well, some of the things, like school records, his prison records, it doesn't take a long time to get those, does it?       What about the position of the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if there is an extension of Martinez to cover this case, then at least give the Texas courts the first crack at deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, instead of having that done in the Federal court?
11-1025 +++$+++        General Verrilli, can you be specific on who that person would be?     Because, as I understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal offense.     It's more probable that their clients would be; but, according to the government, their clients have no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who are noncitizens who acted abroad. So it's hard for me to envision.     I see the theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person who would be subject to a criminal charge who could raise an objection.       So the client is somebody who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S. citizen.       How likely is it that a service provider would object?       And the litigation was unsuccessful.       Well, using what you just mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court should hold there is standing.     Couldn't the government then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this information is classified, these are state secrets, we can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?       General Verrilli, but in this case the Complainant can never know.     I mean, I know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim, but it's not speculative if the government being given this authority by Congress is going to use it.     Isn't that so? I mean, are we to assume that --       Is there much of a speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the FISA court ever -- ever turned down an application.       You never know.     There may be dozens of concrete applications affecting the Plaintiffs in this case, but we will never know.       Which they can never, never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there could be a person in this category who would know, but the person will never know. You did mention minimization procedures as one safeguard against abuse.     What are the minimum -- what -- what minimization standards are taken that will protect plaintiffs in this class?
11-10362 +++$+++       Would that include, say, a meat -- a meat inspector?    There is a wide range of Federal employees that have arrest or search or seizure -       I understand --       Your view is that the limitation is scope of employment.       The scope of employment is, and you don't add on anything else to that.     You don't add arrest, search and seizure. But does this whole issue have an academic flavor, because how in the world could the conduct involved in this case qualify as within the scope of employment?       Mr. Yang, even if -- if -- it depends on State law, that's clear.     But does the United States sometimes concede scope of authority so it can represent -- it can be the sole defendant in the case, the individual officer is off the hook, so that the United States could make the argument:     It never happened; the officer didn't do what the plaintiff charged?
11-1059 +++$+++        Did that offer include admission of liability? Or was it just that it was going to pay the amount of damages requested?       So if -- if there were judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for all other people similarly situated?       Well, that -- so the next case is another employee who claims uncompensated work time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated people.     Then that next case, the employer would be -- would be subject to summary judgment because the liability has been established.       But it was not possible for anything to be done about the certification because you moved immediately.     The complaint is filed, and then you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment that you did.       But there is nothing in Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule that provides as the only sanction, if the plaintiff continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then the plaintiff has to pay the costs.     Rule 68 doesn't say anything about dismissing suits.       What do you do when -- when you have a governing statute that says that an employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and other employees similarly situated?     Can you use a mere rule, Rule 68, to cut out what the statute authors -- authorizes; that is, that the employee can seek relief on behalf of himself and others similarly situated? Mustn't you give a chance for the statutory provision to work, which you didn't.     By filing immediately, you didn't allow the normal process of inviting opt-ins to occur.       Yes, but you have to give the plaintiff an opportunity.     That --       Suppose -- suppose the plaintiff had simultaneously, with the filing of the complaint, moved to have it first preliminarily certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so, instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a collective complaint, separate from a motion for certification, they came together, that the plaintiff filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for certification and a request to discover the names of other people similarly situated.       So your answer is it wouldn't make any difference?       Was there attorneys' fees in that offer?     I thought there wasn't in --       Mr. Mann, if this is -- if what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be no issue preclusion because there has been no -- been no adjudication of anything.     Then it seems to me that this case falls into a classic exception to mootness, which is defendant's voluntary cessation doesn't moot a controversy.     And this controversy is capable of repetition yet evasive review because every time -- so the plaintiff's got this judgment, not preclusive. The employer continues in the old ways.     The plaintiff sues again.     This seems to me to fit exactly into that category of cases.     If there is no issue preclusion, defendant doesn't have to stop the practice, can continue the practice, and then every time there is a suit say, okay, we'll pay the judgment.       But there is nothing litigated when you have --       Claim preclusion, but the claim is, for this period of time, I wasn't given the compensation.     That's the claim.       And then there is another period of time, and there is no issue preclusion.
11-1085 +++$+++        I thought we were talking about, Mr. Waxman, the materiality of the alleged misstatement, and I am really nonplussed by your answer that, if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't end it for everybody.     Certainly, it should -- it ends it for the class; you said that.     Should it also end it for the representative of the class to say, okay, now I'm going to come back, and this statement, -this finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me. Of course, it's going to bind the class representative.     So if it's immaterial, the case ends. And if it is material, then it is material to everybody in the class.       Mr. Waxman --       Mr. Waxman, there is no question about 23(a), right?     The 23(a) prerequisites have been satisfied.       So the only thing is (b)(3), that is that a question of law or fact common to the class members predominates over questions affecting only individual members.     The question that predominates is the question of, were these representations material; if they were material, then the certification is proper. If they were immaterial, it's not.     It's just -- I don't understand why this isn't just a clear case of a question common to the class; that is, the question of materiality.       Mr. Waxman, the -- the Basic opinion that started all this off, on page 242, lists materiality as a common question.     The materiality of the misrepresentation, if any, is listed as a common question, and that made perfect sense to me.       Mr. Waxman, you seem to be setting up two determinations of materiality.     You say, in order to certify the class, you have to show that the misrepresentation was material.     And in order to win on the merits, you certainly have to show that the misrepresentation was material. How do those two findings of materiality differ?     How does the finding that you say must be made at the certification stage differ from the finding that must be made at the trial?       But Im still -- what -- what does "material" mean at the trial level, what does "material" mean at the certification?       So it's the same question.     It has to be -- if it's established at the certification stage, it has to be established again at trial?       It sounds like you are saying you have to win on the merits of the materiality question in order to get the class certified.
11-1118 +++$+++        The question is whether the experimental use -- whether that was a viable theory.     Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you mean by, "substantial"?       Do you mean substantial beyond the -- the -- this particular case?
11-1160 +++$+++        Mr. Horwich, you said in -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within their geographic area, then the clear articulation requirement would be satisfied. But the Authorities Law does authorize the acquisition of other hospitals.     And it doesn't say one or two; it says other -- other facilities. So why doesn't the hospital laws law do exactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear articulation requirement?
11-1175 +++$+++        Yes, indeed, but -- but you are assuming a conflict.     You're saying either the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but the statute can be read to say, we're describing one category of case, we are describing the worst case, the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, and the statute deals with that category of person and no other. So if you're not a bad-faith harassing plaintiff, but you, nonetheless, lost, then you're under (d).       Well, there are a number of reasons.     One is symmetry because they have costs in the part about defendants.     And the concern that, well, if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get only attorney's fees and not costs. So the statute's provisions like this may be redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very well want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the defendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a plaintiff.       Ms. Zieve, if we look at other statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at statutes involving lenders, so we would look at the -- the Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the Credit Organizations Act --       -- and those do not provide for attorney's fees.     They are covered only under 54(d), which is costs, not fees.     Why should we read this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant under this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off with respect to costs than defendants under the other lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)? Congress gave defendants something more here.     Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d) would apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending Act, but not to the lender under -- under this Act?
11-1221 +++$+++        But it's written -- but it's written in such precise terms, it must be incorporated in a divorce decree, and the decree must be filed with the employee agency pre-death.     What you're saying is this specific exception, rightly cabined, is generalized so that in all cases, the second wife will prevail over the first.       Why should it be different than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and one -- one case that you cite quite often is the Hisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference to State domestic relations law, but what was the outcome in that case?       What -- what was the issue?     What was the issue in Rose?       Now, they were taking them from him to support his family.       Which is quite something different.     This is taking it from the designated beneficiary and giving it to somebody who isn't designated.       Mr. Ruttenberg, how do you get to this notion that administrative convenience is all that is involved?     After all, this is an employee's life insurance and the Government is saying to the employee, the beneficiary is your free choice, you can pick anyone, your spouse, a charity, it's your choice, but we want you to know that, although you make it and you can change it any time you want, if you don't change it that will be it. That -- so it's giving, the employee, control over the proceeds of his or her life insurance. Why isn't that a purpose along with administrative convenience?       You would agree with that?     I assume you would agree with what Justice Alito just said?       That it has only to do with administrative convenience?       Why should this scheme be treated differently than the National Service Life Insurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway? Those operated the same way.     They said the person who designates says who gets it and if you -- the only way you can change it is to have a change of beneficiary form filed with your employer, if you don't do that, whatever you've said is where the money goes.       But the two decisions that dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as an alternative ground of decision.     It was quite separate and discrete from saying what's on the beneficiary, the designation that controls.     And they say, and also there's this anti-attachment.       In -- in your briefs in this case, you put in the assignment provision as -- as an afterthought.     I think you did not put it in your main brief.     It came up only in your reply brief, and you didn't put it in the appendix to your main brief.       So you -- you seem to assign lesser importance to it.       Mr. Ruttenberg, what about the interest, which was an interest in Wissner and in Ridgway, of uniformity under this Federal insurance scheme?     That is, one of the hypotheticals in the briefs was the deceased dies domiciled in Virginia.     Wife number 1 comes from X State, not Virginia, wife number 2 two from Y State, and they all have different - different rules.     The employee, in the course of her career, may move around from here to there. But if you follow the Federal law, then it's going to be the same for every employee.     These are the rules for every employee no matter where he or she lives, no matter the location of the spouse.     And then we don't have these messy problems with choice of law.
11-1231 +++$+++        The -- the Court's decision in Henderson against Shinseki, that also involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet, we said that equitable tolling was permissible.       Could she -- could she have adopted equitable tolling?
11-1274 +++$+++        Mr. Liman.     Mr. Liman, you -- you are typing this a penalty case.     The government says yes the accrual is the ordinary rule, but discovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is alleged here.     So how does the Court decide whether to type this case a penalty case, as you urge, or a fraud case, as the government urged -- urges, when both captions fit?       How did the government take it out?     I mean, the point here is that there was a concealment.     There was a hiding of what was -- the impermissible action.       Mr. Liman, how does it work with a disgorgement remedy?     I take it that that's still -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement?       But you don't apply -- you don't say it's too late for them to sue for disgorgement?       So is there any statute of limitations on disgorgement?       Are there no statutes, Mr. Liman, that say the claim accrues when the injury is discovered, that use both -- both terms?       Are there no statutes that use both terms, "accrues" and "discovery"?     A statute, for example, that says, this claim accrues when the injury is discovered?
11-1285 +++$+++        With Sereboff, that you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I assume, also the common fund doctrine, so -- so it's -- it's an open question.       Where is that abrogation -- where is that abrogation in this -- not the plan description, but the plan itself -- what clear language in the plan bars the -- the --       But that --       I'm asking about the plan itself because the plan controls if there's a discrepancy.       Yes.     And I -- and I don't -- you -- you make a distinction between reimbursement clause and the subrogation clause.     And this -- as far as I can tell from the plan, is no reimbursement clause. The only one that's there is labeled "subrogation."     And I looked at what's in the plan, and I don't see language that clearly abrogates the common fund.
11-1327 +++$+++        Even when the defendant interjected this issue and the defendant urged the judge to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate the higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser crime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial judge into error.     The trial judge didn't come up with this on his own.       But you're not arguing that that was the correct charge that --       Could a system say, if you have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the case, then arguments like the one that the defendant made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and if they are not made pretrial, they are waived.     I mean, here, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the defendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system had built into it a requirement that defendants that are going to make this kind of plea do it pretrial.
11-1347 +++$+++        Why would it make any difference?     Once -- once the decision -- the district court decision is vacated, then the State court can go forward.     There is nothing that inhibits it from doing so.     There is no Federal court order.     So your third point, I think, is --       Now, I don't understand that.     The child is now in Scotland.       So how would these six months be satisfied?       But you can argue that on the basis of the vacation of the district court's Hague Convention order.     You -- you're not inhibited by anything, as far as I can see, that the Federal court has done.     Since it's been vacated, it's as though it never happened.       But you don't have -- you don't have that individual -- the residence -- habitual residence determination because it's been wiped out.       When you say, "bring the child back," there's an impediment to that because now this court in Scotland has told her don't -- the child stays here.     There's an order that the child not be removed from Scotland, and there is also -- doesn't the mother have -- wasn't this mother deported?       So if she -- she -- if she -- the mother comes back into the United States, she's committing a criminal offense.       But what about the order of the court in Scotland?       How long has the child been -- now since -- since the return, pursuant to the Federal court's order, how long has the child been residing in Scotland?       Is that done in a separate judgment?     The --       And is there any problem about the time to appeal from that having run?       But, as far as mootness is concerned, if you have not appealed from that order and the time has run from your appeal, you can't rely on that to avoid mootness.       But in Scotland, it's -- it would be a custody proceeding.     Forget about the Hague.     The child is there.     The mother is bringing a custody proceeding.     And the question for that court is where is the child's habitual residence now?       But that was only for determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague Convention is out of it, then there is a custody proceeding.     The idea of the Hague Convention is just to get the case to a forum that's an appropriate forum to decide the custody question, right?       Ms. Saharsky, not to -- I mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to stop this shuttling the child back and forth.     But, because of this unfortunate situation we have, where the district judge wouldn't give a stay, you're -- what you're -- what you're urging is exactly what this Convention was meant to stop. This child has been in Scotland for 14 months.     Now, you say bring it back to the United States, and we -- we start over.     The whole object of the return procedure is so that you get the child to a place that's a proper place to determine custody; isn't that right?       You agree that the ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending appeal and an expedited appeal.     But there is no rule that -- that requires that, so how -- how could that sensible procedure be put in place?       But we wouldn't go back to what should have happened, that is, the district judge applying the four factor test -- or did the district -- there was an application for a stay.     It was denied, right?       But that was the purpose of the Convention, was to cut that out.     That's the whole reason for the Convention, that they wanted to stop the shuttling of children. Do you -- are you aware of rereturn? Your -- your thesis is that the -- that, now, the court of appeals could tell the district judge, you were wrong.     And then the father, armed with that, can go and get a rereturn order from the Scottish court under the Convention. Have there been instances under the Convention, was this question of rereturn -- is rereturn authorized, assuming that there was a valid return order, at least valid when it was entered and when the child was returned --       What is the incidence of rereturn under the Hague Convention?       Was the child returned? Or was it just a decision that the appeal could not be avoided?     Was the child returned by Poland?       That's -- see, that's the whole problem, is that you -- you're going to have rival decrees of two countries, which is what -- exactly what the Convention was meant to avoid.
11-1351 +++$+++        Mr. Feldman, but it says, first, "for purposes of this section."     And, as I -- I understand your argument, those words don't count.     In other words, you would be making -- you would interpret the statute the same way if the sentence started with "the provisions of Section 2680(h)."       The Veterans Administration, it doesn't say that, does it?       Yes.       Mr. Feldman, do I understand the mechanics of this right, that, if the injured person sued the United States directly, that suit would fail because the battery exclusion would apply, but it's only by suing the officer -- the doctor and then getting the United States substituted that the battery exception is abrogated; is that right?       Mr. Feldman, when the Westfall Act, which doesn't abrogate the intentional tort provision, when that was passed, why -- was there any reason why Congress kept these five or six separate acts, like the Gonzalez Act, instead of saying, well, we did this piecemeal for particular agencies, and, now, we were dealing with Federal employees across the board, so there is no reason why we should have these five or six that go another way?
11-139 +++$+++        But he did say that something was unambiguous, and that was the little (i) that was added.     And he also said he wasn't taking any position on the '54 code; isn't that so?       He did.       Can you clarify, Mr. Stewart, two things that Justice Breyer brought up? One, he said that the IRS had given people advice that Son of BOSS was okay; it would work -- this tax shelter, this tax scheme, would work. And then he said -- he suggested that a basis is like deductions.     And you agree that overstatement of deductions don't get you the longer statute of limitations.     So, why -- why should an inflated basis get you to 6 years when inflated deductions don't?     That's one question. And the other question is, is it so, that agents told people that Son of BOSS would work?     Is --
11-1425 +++$+++        But he said -- he said in the ten or so cases he had had in the past, I had -- I encountered no difficulty getting a warrant in prior cases.     There was nothing that distinguished this case on the facts from other cases on the facts.       Probable cause is not enough.     If you have probable cause, then you can get a warrant.     But it was and I think still is the main rule that if you can get a warrant, you must do that. Probable cause is surely not enough.     Then we'd never need a warrant when there's probable cause.       But we do have -- we do have, I think, an indication that there are jurisdictions that do it inside of a half-hour.       Ms. Saharsky, what about saying at least they should try, since a number of jurisdictions can do this within a half hour, say, initiate the process while you are going to the hospital; when a half-hour is up you proceed; but at least there has been an effort to get a warrant.       You mentioned Schmerber. Why did the Court go through all of the -- why -- it could have made it a much shorter opinion by simply saying, yes, blood alcohol dissipates.     But it didn't. It -- it pointed out that in that particular case there was a delay to investigate the accident, the person had to be taken to the hospital for care, so how much time elapsed?     I think it was two hours, wasn't it?       What was all the -- why was it in the opinion?       Yes.     They didn't need to say any of that.
11-1447 +++$+++        Let's back up.     When he asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest of my property.     So he recognized, from day one, that there had to be some mitigation for what he was seeking to do in the permit.     Is that right?       And if he had offered nothing, and he just said, I want this permit to develop my land, and the agency said, you have offered no mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim?       Suppose he just put in the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any kind, and the agency says no.     You recognize that he would have no claim, right?     That he had an obligation to mitigate.       I think you -- I think you have a problem then, Mr. Beard, because, if you look at the record, the record is very clear that it was not -- that the district didn't come back and say, take it or leave it, you -- you improve our wetlands, or you get no permit. There was -- and if you -- they are set out in the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at least half a dozen, maybe more, that the -- the district said, here are several ways -- several ways that you could sufficiently offset the adverse impact.     And some of them had nothing to do with improving the government's own land. So if we can't -- we really can't say this was a take it or leave it, either you do the improvement that we are asking you to do, or you get no permit, what do you do with the fact that, as the appendix certainly bears out, that the district offered a range, it offered many, many ways that this permit might be granted.     And then it says, then you are free to come up with some other -- something else.       Not -- not -- because he wouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's -- some of these options -- one was that he -- that he adjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller. The -- the staff suggested eliminating -- no, that -- that's a different one. But there was one that suggested that he -- he reduce the scale, the Petitioner reduce the scale of his project to one acre and preserve the rest for the conservation easement.     Now, if that -- if he took that, would you have any -- any case here?       If they said, we will give you -- we will give you a permit if you reduce the scale of your project to one acre, and then preserve the rest by a conservation easement?       Suppose the record just doesn't bear that out; the record shows that it wasn't one option.     They gave him a laundry list of things he could do, some -- some of them having nothing whatever to do -- anything off his own property. Suppose the -- whatever the district court might have said, the record shows that the agency said, you're right, seven things you could do, come up with here are six, if you have something else.     And some of them have absolutely nothing to do with other properties.       Where -- where is that?
11-1450 +++$+++        Mr. Boutrous, I thought at least as an alternative argument, you're saying:     The statute itself is silent.     It doesn't deal with this question of amount in controversy.     However, the individual, the named plaintiff, who has said, I'm not going to seek more than the $5 million, cannot speak for the members of the class who are absent.     He can't stipulate that they will take under 5,000. I thought that was the central part of your argument, not based on the statute itself, but on the notion that a named plaintiff, unless and until he is -- he is certified to represent the class - doesn't represent them. He can represent himself, but he can't bind the people who -- who have not been certified as part of a class.     I thought that was part of your argument.       What about specifically the question that the Chief asked about time?     You did argue in the district court that these plaintiffs could have specified a 5-year time period, in which case it would be clear that the amount in controversy was satisfied.     But instead, they took a 2-year period. Can we take that also into account in determining the amount in controversy, that the complaint could have been enlarged to include 5 years instead of 2 years?       Your concern is that the -- that the certification -- if the certification would occur in the Federal court, that's one thing.     But you're -- you're saying that the named plaintiff can't stand for the entire class when we know that -- that the certification question, if the stipulation is binding to prevent removal, it's going to be the State court that's going to look into the adequacy of representation and whether the stipulation binds all members of the class. That's your whole concern.     If the -- if the Federal court made that determination, I think you wouldn't be here.       What do you do -- in the language in 1332(d)(1)(D), the term "class members" means the persons, named or unnamed, who fall within the definition of the proposed class, the proposed class, and that's what we have here.
11-1518 +++$+++        Well, what we have here is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the investments that were made.     So what, in addition to being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the government tells us should be enough to make defalcation, what else other than that it was not authorized and it was self-dealing?       But is a trustee who is taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life insurance making an investment for the benefit of himself and his mother getting profit from that investment and not sharing it with the other siblings who are also.     So what more than -- I mean, he did that all advertently.       But what about the two other transactions which were not done at the bidding of the father?       But what -- what about the profit from the transactions, the profit that he made?     Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but in addition to that, according to the Illinois court judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust.       May I ask you question that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he - the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right?       And the Eleventh Circuit said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the collateral.     If you could sell the collateral, then you could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare bankruptcy. Did you bring such a suit, the suit that suggests that the bank was the culpable party here by not letting you sell the property which would have enabled you to pay the debt?       Mr. Byrne, I -- I wasn't finished asking you about the background of this.     It - it seems the simplest thing, if the bank is the culprit, then why not go after the bank and then get the money which would make the Chapter 7 unnecessary?       But it was what the Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem.       And were they wrong in -
11-1545 +++$+++        Mr. Goldstein, this case has been presented in a very complicated way, but it seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's rule-making power, as you know, is very broad. They have power to make the rules needed to carry out the provisions of the Act.     And 332 is -- counts as a provision of the Act.     So why isn't it just a proper implementation of that rule-making authority?       But if the abstract question really isn't presented -- I mean, just to follow on what I asked you first, here is a phrase, "a reasonable time."     And the Commission interprets that phrase in a reasonable way. Why is this case any more complicated than that?     Why doesn't the FCC have the authority to interpret that term, within a reasonable time?       Mr. Goldstein, in following that, it seems to me you -- you are basing your argument on what is said in 7(a).     And that preserves the authority of the local governments.     But the provision that we are talking about is (b), and (b) says limitations, authority that the local governments do not have, and among those limitations is that they have to act within a reasonable time.       I just don't understand how the FCC's general rule-making authority is removed as to a provision that limits what the State and local governments can do.       But you are -- you are skipping over (2), which is the phrase "reasonable time."       Just -- just on a practical level --       -- what sense does it make to read this to say that each time there is a dispute that comes to the Court, the Court will decide in that particular case, with no guide at all, what the reasonable time is?       How do you know -- how do you know when it's 30 days after a failure to act?       Where does that say anything about what you just read about what is a reasonable time?
11-159 +++$+++        Those are -- those are obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose parents are not married.       Mr. Miller, there's one provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell me what it means.     It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last sentence of (A).     It says:     "Applicants who according to State law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child ... shall be deemed such."     What person is that referring to? Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a child?       Anyone else or just that category?       It -- it was addressed in the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it?
11-161 +++$+++        Mr. Stancil, who are "these people"?     We have the plaintiffs in this suit, and there's a judgment -- there was a judgment in the court of first instance and the appellate court for a dollar amount, but we're told that there are many more of these Barrett Law projects and that they all operate the same way. So, the result is a lot more money than these plaintiffs are claiming; is that not so?     If your position on the law is right.       Why isn't that a choice for the legislature?     Because everybody could be treated equally by getting their money back, or nobody gets out from under the old system.     So, why shouldn't that be - the decision is you can't treat these two groups of people differently.     So, I think the Court has said in a number of cases you can equalize up or down.     That is a legislative choice.
11-166 +++$+++        But how does one determine what is the indubitable equivalent of the creditor's claim?       The -- the sale -- something -- the sale can't go on without the court's approval.     I mean, the -- the auction has to have the court's approval, right?       And so what qualifies as indubitably equivalent?       Suppose the -- suppose the creditor thinks that the -- the sale was -- undervalued the assets, that it -- it wasn't the equivalent?
11-182 +++$+++        But how would the state officer know if the person is removable?     I mean, that's sometimes a complex inquiry.       They did -- they did provide -- I mean, your position was the Federal legislation regulates the supply side.     That leaves the demand side open.     But there is regulation, and the question is whether anything beyond that is inconsistent with the -- the Federal -- it's not just that the person is removable, but, if they use false documents in seeking work, that's a Federal crime. So we have the -- what you call the supply side is -- is regulated, but you want to regulate it more.       Mr. Clement, it seems that the -- I would think the largest hurdle for you is Hines, which said the registration scheme -- Congress enacted a complete registration scheme which the states cannot complement or impose even auxiliary regulations. So I don't see the alien registration as a question of obstacle preemption, but appeal preemption that alien -- we don't want a competing registration scheme.     We want the registration scheme to be wholly Federal.
11-184 +++$+++        Mr. Schnapper, could you clarify what the district court, as you see it, does? Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling?       Why don't we take this -- this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it as an affirmative defense.       That's -- you're talking about the discrimination claim.     In your view, could the plaintiff now in the district court say, I'll forget the CSRA remedy; district court, you have authority to hear the Title VII case, the ADEA case, and that's all I need?    And so I'm not -- I'm abandoning my CSRA.      And then that would take care of the whole thing you discussed before about the affirmative defense and the Government.    It would be the plaintiff's choice, I want my Title VII case and that's it.       Mr. Schnapper, can you explain something about the MSPB's role?     That is, once you have a final decision from the agency, you could go right to court.     You don't -- on the discrimination claim, right?     You don't need to go to the MSPB.     You don't have to exhaust anything before the MSPB to get your discrimination claim.     So, how does the M -- the possibility of going to the MSPB make the discrimination claim any less ripe for judicial review than it would be if you stopped at the agency level?       What are -- what are your advantages?     You are deciding -- you have the final agency decision, you could go right to court on the discrimination claim.     What do you gain by invoking the MSPB's authority?
11-192 +++$+++        Mr. Srinivasan --       The United States -- the United States is governed by the substance of the Credit Reporting Act.     The Act applies to the Government, but your point is there's no sanction for noncompliance, even though the United States, a Government system, is supposed to conform to the standards in the Act.
11-199 +++$+++        Well, you're -- and you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think did say this error is harmful.       And so, you're not saying that it's just that they didn't use the right formula, but you would say, given what occurred here, the importance of this witness, that -- that this was a -- this was a harmful error?       I thought -- I thought your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than a hypothetical jury.     But I thought your main point is that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the record, and if the rest of the record warrants conviction, no harmless error. I thought that what you're saying is that the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to; are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they just asking the question, let's take out the tainted evidence, see if there's enough to convict?
11-204 +++$+++        Because -- because the limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law, they can't sell.     And you -- you are debating about exchange, sale.     What strikes one about this case is that these are workers -- they work autonomously.     They don't clock in and out.     They work outside the workplace.     After they're trained, they have minimal supervision. Is there any other category of exempt workers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come under the wage and hours law?       For example, what are the -- that's what I wanted to know.     What are the categories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the type that clocks in and out?       What about -- what about the extras?     I mean, we're told that part of this job is to have a good relationship with the doctors.     It includes dinners.     It may be conventions. Entertainment, maybe golf.     If -- if you're right, would the time on the golf course get time and a half?       You were -- you were giving examples, and we just stopped at --       -- emergency service worker.     But you said there are many examples --       -- of people who are highly autonomous and still come under the hours regulation.       May I ask you to follow up on other -- other categories of employee?     You gave me cleaning workers, emergency service workers.     Are any of those categories people who get paid commissions?       Mr. Malcolm -- Mr. Stewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no longer available, that the Department of Labor no longer gives opinion letters?
11-210 +++$+++        Suppose -- suppose, General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and Congress had said we don't like people saying that they were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never served for a single day in any armed force.     So, they have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to the false claim that one has served in the armed forces. I don't see in your argument that there's something special about the decorations.       Well, the assumption - the assumption is that it's false.     That was -- and that it's not so hard to find out if somebody claims to have the Medal of Honor and he doesn't.     So that -- first, you answered yes, that it's only self, and now you said, no, it's -- it can be -- or at least I think you said - making a false statement of fact.     And the concern is - and I gave you the question of just in service, leaving out the -- the decorations -- other statements of fact, false statements like "I deny that the Holocaust ever occurred."     That's a statement -- a false statement of fact, isn't it?       Did the military -- did the military ask for this?     You're claiming there's a special interest in seeing that a military honor is not debased.
11-246 +++$+++        And that wouldn't be true of Mr. Patchak?     Suppose he had filed in the 30-day window. The Secretary gives notice to affected persons. So he comes in and he says:     I think that you don't have authority to do it because this tribe wasn't under Federal jurisdiction, and so I want you to call -- call it off.     Nothing -- nothing has been transferred within 30 days. I thought both your brief and the tribe's brief said that the judicial review would be available to any affected person who used that procedure.     Is that -- is that true?       But you said -- you had it was important if.     So the argument is this tribe wasn't under Federal jurisdiction.     I could raise that because I'm an affected person.     Somebody's got to be able to enforce against the Secretary the limitations that Congress put on the Secretary.     So would there be standing in that situation? Mr. Patchak comes in within the 30-day period, so he's not trying to undo any done deal.       So then you disagree with the tribe that said in no uncertain terms, in its reply brief, that this case is not about the availability of judicial review.     Judicial review was available in the 30-day window.
11-262 +++$+++        What was the probable --       What was the probable cause?     What was the probable cause for the arrest?       Explain that to me. That's a false statement to a government officer, but that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that these officers had to arrest.     They -- there was a question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think that the charge that eventually was made in the State court was harassment.     So, there's no indication that these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds.       You're not suggesting absolute immunity?       But it's a different kind of qualified immunity?       Even though this -- I think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific reasons, neither of which apply in this context.     I mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who would be absolutely immune.     So, that is not in this picture.     Here we have one officer. So, it would certainly be an extension of Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather than arrest.       May I go back to the probable cause, the question I asked before?     It's not like the taillight.     1001 came up in court.     I -- this situation may well have warranted probable cause for assault, probable cause for harassment.     But where did -- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind.     It does seem quite strange.       But doesn't it matter that it's something that comes up only in court; it's not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural -- well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges that were made?
11-338 +++$+++        But there was no ruling in the court of appeals.     The court of appeals did not rule on the statute -- whether the statute mandates that these logging roads be governed.       So is -       And so that's not a point that this Court could resolve in the first instance.       Yes, you can do that; but this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we don't take questions that haven't been aired below.       You wouldn't have to do anything if the Court vacated the decision below.     Then you wouldn't be facing anything.       Would you be -       Would you be entitled to it?       So -- so if you're right, that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then there is nothing.     You don't have anything hanging over your head as a result -       -- of the prior decision.
11-345 +++$+++        Mr. Rein, before we get to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on its own, the question of -- of standing.     The injury -- if the injury is rejection by the University of Texas, and the answer is, no matter what, this person would not have been accepted, then how is the injury caused by the affirmative action program?       May I ask you on that specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution. Suppose the only plan were the one that is before the Court now, no 10 percent.     This is the exclusive way that the University is attempting to increase minority enrollment. Then, if we had no 10 percent solution, under Grutter, would this plan be acceptable?       Well, then the -- the question is can you have both?     But it seems to me that this program is certainly no more aggressive than the one in -- in Grutter; it's more -- in fact, more modest.       Mr. -- Mr. Rein, it seems to me that, in your talking about critical mass, you are relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough.     They don't -- they got minorities through the 10 percent, so they don't need any more.     And I tried to get you rigidly to focus on -- forget the 10 percent plan.     This is the entire plan.       Because of the 10 percent.       But is the -- the race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?       But you say, and that's okay because it's -- it's race-neutral.     But is it really?     The -- the only reason that they instituted the percent plan was to increase minority enrollment.       And it -- and that -- the only way it works is if you have heavily separated schools.     And worse than that, I mean, if you -- if you want to go to the University of Texas under the 10 percent plan, you go to the low-performing school, you don't take challenging courses, because that's how you'll get into the 10 percent. So maybe the University is concerned that that is an inadequate way to deal with it.       Is it any more unchecked than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off in 1978, decided by Justice Powell?     Is it any different from how race is used in our military academies?
11-393 +++$+++        Mr. Clement, there are so many things in this Act that are unquestionably okay.     I think you would concede that reauthorizing -- what is it -- the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, changes to the Black Lung benefits.     Why make Congress redo those? I mean, it's a question of whether we say everything you did is no good, now start from scratch, or to say, yes, there are many things in here that have nothing to do, frankly, with the affordable health care, and there are some that we think it's better to let Congress to decide whether it wants them in or out. So, why should we say it's a choice between a wrecking operation, which is what you are requesting, or a salvage job?     And the more conservative approach would be salvage rather than throwing out everything.
11-45 +++$+++        Are you -- you're talking --       Mr. Schwartz, I thought you're talking about the constitutionality of a statute.       Not any constitutional claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an official.     I thought that your point was when you're challenging the constitutionality of a statute, then you have a right to go to the district court.       I thought your position was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we have no authority to adjudicate constitutional questions, period.       So, I thought that the court was saying this claim is dismissed because we don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of question.     And then your next -- the Federal Circuit -- well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said it didn't have authority to render the decision?       I thought that that's what your position was.       I thought your position was that whatever the MSPB cannot hear, then you can go to the district court.       Do you take the position that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has no jurisdiction, it can't adjudicate this matter, well, then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to -- to review?     There's nothing to review because the MSPB said we have no jurisdiction.       I thought that your point was and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no jurisdiction to decide we have no jurisdiction to review.       And that an appellate court is reviewing a court of first instance.     The scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an appellate court.       I thought you said this one.       This one, because you want to make a record of all the changes that have occurred in the service, and you need much more than briefs.     You need to have maybe testimony from people who have -- who have been working with the changes in the -- in the opportunities for women in service.       I thought your whole point was --
11-460 +++$+++        What was the purpose of having the monitoring station if nothing can be done? And are -- the monitoring shows, yes, there is a lot of pollutants in there, and we know that at least some of them have to be ascribed to the district.     But you say, unless you -- you show the outflow, that it comes from there, no liability. Why shouldn't it be that, given there is going to be a contribution that the district is making, that the district should have the burden of showing, no, there are all these other ones out there, so our percentage is X, not the whole thing?
11-465 +++$+++        Ms. Brenan, we are straying pretty far from this case.     And correct me if I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was made under State law, and then Williams said there was an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the Sixth Amendment was violated. So there really isn't any independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent Sixth Amendment right.     It's State law was violated and therefore the Constitution was violated. So it seems to me if we just look at the position that Williams was taking, that these two, the State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together. And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some other case that might come before us some day would not be wise.       May I ask you about the underlying claim here?     It is quite troublesome.     I think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen charge; is that right?       And the possibility of getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this way is -- is really troublesome. The judge can't give an Allen charge to urge the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome.
11-551 +++$+++        Before you do that --       It was my understanding that that system that has been described as arbitrary was not the one that was applicable to the years in question.       To what extent do you -- do you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up until now, but Congress, in these appropriations, said "not in excess of."       It wasn't just a general "subject to appropriations."     It was a specific amount, the Secretary shall not pay in excess of a certain dollar amount for these costs.      It really --       Mr. Freeman, where did these caps come from?     Did the agency initiate them? Or, there's a chart -- perhaps I don't understand it correctly.     It's on page 210 of the joint appendix.     It does -- it does seem to indicate that it was the BIA that proposed the cutback.       You must answer that question --       You must answer that question "yes" --       -- because that's exactly what the Secretary did.       You -- claimed that it was pro rata.
11-556 +++$+++        Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the question that you're presenting academic in this case? Because didn't the district judge say that there had been no showing that Davis' conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive? It wouldn't matter if the supervisor -- if the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive harassment, and, equally, if the company responded every time a complaint was lodged.     The district court found both of those things, that it wasn't severe and pervasive, and that every time she claimed -- complained an investigation was made.       What other than the job description?     The job description says that the catering specialist has authority to direct or lead the part-time employees.     But what concrete instances of Davis exercising supervisory authority over Vance is there in this record?       What I mean is not the statement, well, she's a supervisor.     But comparable to Faragher, where the lifeguard who didn't have authority to hire her or fire her said, if you don't date me, you are going to be cleaning the toilets.     We don't have anything like that in this record.       But that was also -- that would be for a very confined period.     It would only be when the -- when Vance was a part-time employee.     Once she is a full-time employee there isn't that.       Mr. Ortiz, did she ever have that authority, because the record as far as we have it says that the work assignments, what Vance was doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where people would be stationed.       Have you answered the argument it shouldn't get any deference because what -- what the EEOC guidance does is it is -- it is interpreting two decisions of this Court, and this Court, not the EEOC, is in the best position to determine what those two cases mean?
11-564 +++$+++        Mr. Garre, does your argument mean -- you say minimally intrusive, and that the dog will detect only contraband, that the police then are to go into a neighborhood that's known to be a drug dealing neighborhood, go into -- just go down the street, have the dog sniff in front of every door, or go into an apartment building? Is that -- I gather that that is your position.       Suppose -- suppose the house had on the lawn, no dogs allowed?       Yes, but not implied consent for the policeman to come up with the dog.     The only purpose of the dog is to detect contraband. So you can say, yes, there's an implied invitation to the Girl Scout cookie seller, to the postman, even to the police officer, but not police officer with dog, when the only reason for having the dog is to find out if there's contraband in the house.       This is not any dog. This is a drug detecting dog.       Not this -- not this purpose.     You said centuries, but I think you recognize that it wasn't until the seventies when the dogs were used to find culprits.     But to use it in this way I think it was only since the seventies.       I didn't -- I didn't understand the concession to be that the police had come to the door with the dog, the sole purpose of the dog being to detect contraband.       You're agreeing with Mr. Garre that the police could take a dog and go down every house on the street, every apartment in the building?       A house just like this house?       Well, so any home, any home anywhere, and we should say that that's okay, and we can say it's okay because the government won't use it?       This Court has dealt with an item that was seized before, a piece of luggage, a car.     They have not dealt with the dog sniff in the context of a home that's not seized.
11-5683 +++$+++        Did it -       You're right that if - you're right -       But that's true of all of the cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or three that use "fair implication."     The Court in all those cases found that there was no fair implication, so that 109 governed. Isn't -- isn't that so? That was true in Marrero.     It was true in Northern Securities.       But in none of the cases that used the fair implication language did the Court say:     And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.       So, you're relying on a standard that this Court did -- must have considered appropriate because it deviated from the words of the statute.     It said it a few times.     But in application, it always came out the same way.       But that was not true of the 109 cases.     You don't have a 109 case that said the standard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old statute is not enforced.       Why do you pick the date that the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it - if what -- if the guidelines, the 90-day period that the Commission came out with its new guidelines on November 1st, that's some time after August 3rd, which is when the Sentencing Act.     So, on your theory, why isn't the right date the date that the Sentencing Guidelines went into effect?
11-597 +++$+++        What about this Court's precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where the Court said that for there to be Government responsibility it is at least necessary that the overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to property? We would have to withdraw or modify that statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your argument prevails?       So that would cover a one-time flood.       I don't understand that. You said if -- if it's one flood, even though it destroys the trees, and certainly would not make -- would make it impossible to have picnics, what -- so if that's your position, then you're turning on it happened six times, not once.     Is that --       Mr. Goodhart, maybe it would help to know what you think if we accept your position would be left over for the Federal Circuit to consider on remand.     You -- you haven't asked to -- for outright reversal and have the decision of the Court of Federal Claims be the end of the matter.     So if we accept your position, then what issues would be open for the Federal Circuit to resolve on remand?       But what were the other issues that you just mentioned?     You said we couldn't ask for an automatic affirmance.
11-626 +++$+++        You -- you described cases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that says floating homes like the one here that can be towed and are not in the business of carrying people or goods, but can be towed miles across the water, that those constitute vessels. And this district court decision, Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases.     And you say that that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were wrong?       Mr. Gannon, would you have said sounds like this structure is not a vessel, period.     But your bottom line in your brief is that, if we disagree with the Court of Appeals, we shouldn't say this contrivance is not a vessel, we should send it back -- for what? What finding?       So what would we tell them they should look into?
11-681 +++$+++    I thought it was to negotiate what's typically negotiated in collective bargaining; that is, wages, is that not so? Wages and benefits?   But how does it differ from the typical bargaining that a union does? It asks for a wage rate, and it asks for various benefits. So are you saying that when it's a public -- in the public sector, it gets converted into something else?   But you're not -- you're not challenging -- or it's confusing whether you are or not -- the very idea of exclusive representation by a union. Are you saying that, in the public sector, there cannot be exclusive -- an exclusive bargaining agent?   Is the mandatory -- let's take out, as Justice Alito suggested, take out the agency fee or fair-share fee or whatever it is, but there is an exclusive bargaining agent. Workers, your clients, say, we don't want to be represented by that union. The union is authorized to represent everybody in the workplace and has to represent even nonmembers, as well, without any discrimination. And -- and are you taking the position that there cannot be an exclusive bargaining agent if there are any dissenters who don't want to be represented by a union?   They receive a salary -- I mean, they receive -- it's not a government grant to the -- to the healthcare worker. They receive a paycheck, and the government withholds from that. The government makes a FICA contribution for them and withholds the part that's their responsibility. So it looks just like they are an employee of the government, being paid by the government, and the government doing things that an employer does, withhold income tax, pay in part the FICA tax, withhold the other part. And they are -- they're also covered by workers' compensation, aren't they?   As -- as employees of the State?   They're not getting a paycheck and the insurance -- insurer is not deducting withholding tax -- isn't paying FICA tax?
11-697 +++$+++        But your reading -- your reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere, the copyright owner loses control of distribution everywhere. That is essentially your argument.       So -- but -- so this notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal exhaustion principle.       And we are told that no country has adopted that international exhaustion regime, that most countries adhere to the national exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here. That is, if it's manufactured in the United States and sold in the United States, that copy belongs to the person who purchased it, end of case.     But if the exhaustion doctrine applies only nationally, then your argument is asking for something that runs against the regime that is accepted in most places.       Well, let's take, for example, the European Union, the position in -- in those countries.     Suppose we -- we just transformed -- transferred this case to one of those countries, the exact same case; and my understanding is that they would follow the national exhaustion.       Yes, but not -- not exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's home free all over the world.       Is it all right?     Wasn't there also the question of allowing manufacturers to segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad, governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States governed by U.S. law?     Wasn't segmentation of the market allowing people to do just what these people are doing?       Has that ever happened? I mean, the Ninth Circuit cases have been around for some time.     Has any manufacturer ever moved abroad?
11-702 +++$+++        When you -- now, Mr. Goldstein, when you say, "this case," is there any proof in the record that there was a small amount and no -- no remuneration?       Mr. Goldstein, it's because they are trying to mirror the Federal statute, which makes the small amount and no remuneration, makes that like an affirmative defense.     The burden is on the defendant to show those two things, to get out from under the main statute.       So what the Government is suggesting is as close to the Federal statute as you can get.       You said Carachuri.     That case involved, in -- in order to hold for the government, you would have to go outside the record of the State conviction.     You'd have to add something that wasn't in the State conviction. And it's the same thing here.     To get to where you want to go, you have to add something that isn't in the State conviction.       I don't follow --       -- your answer because I think you have to concede that, under your view, a lot of people who are convicted under the Georgia statute who had a significant quantity, which they intended to distribute --       -- for remuneration --       -- many of those people would -- under your view of the statute, many of those people would -- would not have committed an aggravated felony.       So you have that --       -- a large underinclusiveness problem, which you haven't solved.       But all that follows from, in Carachuri, the government wanted to go outside the record.
11-713 +++$+++        It didn't -- it didn't ignore it.     It took it into account along with other plans.     My -- Mr. Clement, suppose the D.C. court that has exclusive authority over preclearance in mid-February denies preclearance.     And suppose -- suppose we accept your position.     You prevail in -- in this proceeding.     And then the three-judge district court says this -- this plan -- these plans do not meet the section 5 requirement; we deny preclearance.     What happens if we use the Texas plan that has not been precleared as the interim plan?       I don't see how it's basically Upham.     That was a plan -- there were two contiguous districts.     There was a problem with them. The Attorney General said the rest of it was okay.     Here the entire plan -- the plans are -- are opposed.       But the district court in that -- in that scenario is projecting what the D.C. court that has exclusive authority is going to do.     And that's why I find your -- your position troublesome. You're asking one court to make its best guess at what another court is likely to do, and that other court has exclusive jurisdiction.
11-770 +++$+++        But Terry -- Terry is an open question in this case.     It wasn't decided below, but it was raised. So -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend Summers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to the assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.       If they did do -- if they did do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the police officer got a call that said, we found lots of contraband, guns in this house, at that point they could have turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't they?       So if he came back -- I mean, the scenario here is he was supposed to be driving his friend home, and he would have come back while the search was ongoing, but the police could apprehend anyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying, while the search is ongoing --
11-796 +++$+++        But why --       But why -- you said making or use and it isn't an either-or thing then -- as the other side has pointed out.     You can use the seed to make new seeds.     So use and make aren't -- it's not either you use it or you make it.     You can use it to make a new item.       Well, suppose he -- he had never bought any Monsanto seeds.     He just goes to the grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds have the genetic composition.     So -- and he planted that and he harvested it.     Would he be infringing on Monsanto's patents?       So he never has to buy any seed, at all, from Monsanto.       Well, you just said that -- that we haven't had a case involving self-replicating.     I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was shaped with the idea of an article; there was an article that you could use and then you use it and it's used up. But we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you have a new -- when you create a copy of the original. So it's -- it's not that we have law in place.     We've been dealing with an item with the Exhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items, thousands of items, all growing from that original seed.       And they may -- they may they own them, but that doesn't mean that they are infringing.     They may -- the seeds are owned by the farmer.     But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's infringing on that patent.     So I don't think that the ownership has anything to do with it.
11-798 +++$+++        I thought that the Port said we don't apply criminal penalties which come from the tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor carriers.     They made that representation, so I think we have to accept that as being so.       Do we know why, why Congress had a different regulation for ports and for airfields? Page 8       Mr. Bash, how then do you deal with the problem that precipitated all of this? Here is a port that's getting lots of complaints from the neighborhood people.     It wants to expand the port, it's being thwarted by environmental suits, so it wants to go green and it wants to do something about the pollution and the traffic and the hazards from the truck.     You're saying that it can't do that?       And how could a port respond to the complaints if you're making this -- this neighborhood around the Port an environmental hazard? And so we're going to make sure that our representatives vote against any expansion of the Port.       But I thought there -- there was a representation made that they toe the line that the government draws.     That it, they can say, no access as long as you have trucks in your fleet that don't comply.     But once you've gotten your fleet in order and you are in compliance, then we can't punish you for having wronged in the past by saying you're -- you're suspended. That -- that's the position that the government is taking, and I take it you don't agree with that.
11-817 +++$+++        That -- that goes to the field performance; but, the other requirements, that the -- some showing that the test -- that the training program is reputable, some showing that the handler, not only the dog, has -- has had training, it seems to me those two -- not -- there's nothing improper about that.       Why didn't -- then why didn't they get the dog recertified?     By the time of the search, the certification had expired 16 months.       Well, what do you -- what do you have to show to establish that the dog was well trained.       Well, if it were just that -- you have the show that the program was reputable.       Mr. Garre, you said there was the certification, training program, but you gave a third.     You said, or otherwise show proficiency in locating narcotics. So if there is no certification, no training, how would the state establish that the dog was reliable in detecting drugs?       And I think you'll agree that the handler, too, the handler would have to --       Not -- not certification, but that the handler has been -- has been trained --       -- to work with drug detection dogs.       Mr. Palmore, you criticize the Florida Supreme Court for requiring evidence of field performance; and, assuming that that evidence is not required, if the defendant, in preparing for the suppression motion, wants what information there is, would it be proper to seek -- for the defendant -- would it be permissible for the defendant to speak -- to seek through discovery whatever field performance records there are?
11-820 +++$+++        Mr. Fisher --       -- what -- what about the argument that Strickland doesn't come into play unless the Sixth Amendment includes the collateral consequences in counsel's obligation to defend a defendant in a criminal case under the argument that up to -- up to Padilla, only advice relevant to guilt or innocence and sentencing was required, not collateral consequences?       So it's also a question if -- if conviction meant loss of a professional license, that would be an open question?       Is there any -- Mr. Fisher, is there any application, you call it application of Strickland, that would qualify as a new rule, any application at all, or is just Strickland never a new rule?       You answered that question when I asked it, you said that removal of a professional license would not fall under -- wouldn't -- would be at least an open question.       Mr. Fisher --       Mr. Fisher, are you -- you're not making any argument that Teague is inapplicable because this -- the underlying conviction here is a federal conviction, not a state conviction, and Teague emphasized comity to the states; you're not making that argument?
11-864 +++$+++        Mr. Estrada, you are limiting your argument to the determination of damages, as I understand it.       Because the -- because the Third Circuit agreed that, as far as any antitrust impact --       -- that could be established on a class basis.       But why -- why not? Because, generally -- and at least it's my impression -- that in class certifications, if the liability question can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages question may be adjudicated individually. Take a -- take a Title VII case.     A liability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination, therefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an individual basis.     So why isn't bifurcation possible here?       It doesn't have to be the same for every member of the class.     As the dissenting judge pointed out, you can have subclasses.       But you challenged the probity, Mr. Estrada.     You said Comcast said it had no objection to MCClave's qualification as an expert.     So what you were talking about was the probity of this report, not the admissibility.
11-88 +++$+++        I thought Justice -- Judge Edwards' opinion was about politically motivated terrorists not coming within the Alien Tort Statute.       But there were --       There were witnesses who testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA would take care of a Filartiga type case, that when the torturer shows up physically -- those were the words that were used -- the torturer comes into the state, into the United States, is physically present in the United States.     That was the model that at least those witnesses had in mind, and some of them were quite distinguished witnesses.       But you found no tort --       -- no tort statute uses the "individual" to include organizations.
11-889 +++$+++        Mr. Rothfeld, we are told that in other compacts when they really mean to give one State the right to take another State's water, the provision in the compact is much clearer, much more definite. This clause, the one that you rely on, is kind of sketchy, isn't it?     Doesn't say how they're going to get it, if they're going to pay for it. There's a lot to be filled in.       How -- how does it do it? Does it have to apply to Texas?       To Oklahoma.       Who -- who erects the facilities to accomplish this diversion?
11-8976 +++$+++        But -- but you could prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, if you never raised the statute of limitations.     And statutes of limitations exist for civil claims, as well as criminal claims. And in -- on the civil side, the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense.     And it's up to the plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove it, both the burden of production and persuasion.     Why should it be different on the criminal side?       But you -- I think you -- you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden of production, not the government, the burden -- burden of coming forward with this defense and producing some evidence of the withdrawal.       Not -- only for the later period.     It doesn't negate that this person was once a member of the conspiracy.     The government has the burden to show membership, and it did.     So it's not -- it doesn't reach back to negate that there was membership at some time.     It just says, after withdrawal, we no longer prosecute.       But you -- you would have the government prove that twice.     They prove his membership in the conspiracy.     And then you say, once he alleges that he withdrew, they have to prove it again.       What would you -- what would you have to produce to get over your threshold of satisfying the burden of production?       What -- what evidence of withdrawal did you produce in this case?       But you -- you agree -- you agree that that would not have necessarily meant withdrawal?
11-9307 +++$+++        But then what your -- your first answer was that this is a very small set of cases that you're dealing with.     If your answer to Justice Scalia is yes, this Court could take a case that's unsettled and, by settling it, make the error plain.     That would open the door to a huge number of cases, wouldn't it?       Was there a reason -- I think you represented your client at the trial.       Is there a reason why you didn't bring this up when the judge imposed that sentence? I mean, there was -- one thing is Tapia; but, before that, there was a statute that says, judge, don't lengthen sentences for purposes of rehabilitation. And you didn't call that statute to the attention of the -- of the judge, did you?       Were you -- were you aware of the statute at the time?       How many months are left for the defendant's sentence?       He didn't?       But the judge was not aware of those impediments?
11-9335 +++$+++        Ms. Maguire, you don't -- you don't have to take the position that there's no stare decisis effect.     In a unanimous -- a recent unanimous decision of this Court, obviously, would carry more weight than one that has a plurality opinion, so you don't have to say -- it isn't a question of yes or no, it's a question of the degree of respect that we would give to our former decision.       You mentioned drug weight.     Let's -- so you're making -- your argument would mean that drug weight also has to be found by the jury because that can -- the length of the sentence can depend on the -- the drug weight.
11-94 +++$+++        But it's not -- the jury didn't say that the defendant was in violation only 1 day.     It said it was in violation within this span of many months, and it didn't say how many days.     It didn't say whether it was every day or 1 day or 10 days.     It just didn't focus on the number of days.     But it didn't find they were in violation only 1 day, which is what your opening statement was.       Was there an objection at trial to the charge on the ground that it didn't instruct the jury to find the number of days of violation?       What do you make of this old case that the Government cites, U.S. v. Tyler?     And it was the question of -- the penalty was four times the value of the goods, and this Court said the judge, not the jury, is responsible for imposing the fine and, therefore, also for determining the value of the goods.       What about the amount of loss issue that Justice Breyer raised, was very complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is?       If we --       If -- on the question of the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would the standard be?     Would the jury have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was -- that the value was such and such?
11-9540 +++$+++        You don't take issue, do you, with the argument that in -- in determining what the State law is you can take account not only of the words of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court interprets those words?       Let's -- let's get back to this case.     I think what you're saying about the plea colloquy is, even if he had said to the judge, yes, I broke and entered the Metro Mart, even if he had said that, the conviction still would not be for burglary.       There's -- there's probably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor definition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or remaining in a building with intent to commit a crime. Why doesn't this, the crime of which the defendant was convicted, satisfy the remaining, the remaining in the building with intent to commit a crime?       That -- that intent would continue while the person remains in the building.
11-965 +++$+++        We would never get to this question if you hadn't conceded that there is general jurisdiction over the U.S. subsidiary, over - what is it -- MBUSA.       But if there were nothing to attribute, then that would be the end of it.     If there was -- if there was not general jurisdiction over MBUSA, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it?       But you didn't -- we can't resolve it that way since you -- you didn't challenge the general jurisdiction over the subsidiary.       But suppose -- but suppose we had a case of an accident on a California highway injuring California people and they sued, charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively manufactured. Would there be jurisdiction over both the parent and the sub in that situation?       And what does that mean? I mean, it certainly wanted to have its cars sold in - in California.       Well, there was injury in the forum, and it was caused by defective manufacturing abroad.     That's a typical basis for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes.       But it does -- it does provide for the exercise of jurisdiction to the limits of due process.       But that was -- that was conceded.     But that was -- there is a very substantial argument that there was no general jurisdiction over the subsidiary, but that was not contested below.       And a party can always consent to jurisdiction.       Well, you don't -- you wouldn't have any doubt, would you, in the hypothetical that I pose, a Mercedes Benz car causes an accident - there's an accident in California.     It's alleged that the accident was the defective manufacturing of that car.     California people are injured.     There would be jurisdiction in a California court.
11-982 +++$+++        But, Mr. Dabney, are you saying that this device of the unilateral covenant is no good, unless it says that you will never be sued for any shoe that you ever produce?     Is -- are you saying that the covenant is no good or that this covenant is deficient?       So -- if -- if you are uneasy about the covenant as it exists, why didn't you say, judge, this covenant doesn't give us adequate protection, it should be amended, and then say what you think you need to be adequately covered?       Mr. Dabney, that's a different answer than the one you gave me when I asked the same question.     You said because we don't want to be an involuntary licensee of Nike.       But can you -- can you just explain to me -- you've given a name to this carte blanche that -- that Nike would give you.     What is the significance of your being an involuntary licensee? It's not something that -- that you wear as a brand.     I mean --       Then you're going back to saying the covenant -- no covenant is any good.       Mr. Dabney, suppose there had been no infringement claim, could you have -- but you're in the shoe business and you're -- you're worried -- could you have brought a declaratory action or an action for an injunction to have the trademark declared invalid?       So you say you could not have brought a suit to -- to cancel?       But, Mr. Dabney, you told me that you could not bring such an independent suit, you have to be stung once.     So you can bring it as a counterclaim, as you did here, once there's an infringement suit, but you -- you did say that you could not just walk into court and say, I want an injunction invalidating the trademark.       Ms. Anders, you did say, if I recall correctly, that Congress regarded the PTO as the preferred form for cancellation proceedings.     The -- the statute sets up the PTO proceeding, but it also allows the claim to be brought in -- in court.     So what -- what shows that Congress meant these claims to be -- to go to the agency in preference to the court?
11-9953 +++$+++        The one -- the one counsel who was qualified, what was his name?       Lorenzi, yes.     He was only one at the time who was qualified to be lead counsel?       And the Louisiana Supreme Court said, you don't have to do this.     You're his -- you're his attorney, but you have a right to be paid, and the State has to pay you. So there was no obligation on the counsel's part to do anything; and he kept asking, please have a funding order, let me be paid, and I'll do my job.       You would like us to say what Judge Cook said in -- in her opinion, that responsibility for funding rests with the State, not with the defendant. Once an attorney is appointed, it is the State's obligation to ensure that adequate funds are available for the defense.     And I take "for the defense" to mean not simply counsel, but the witnesses, the -- the investigation. It is certainly true that none of the delay due to the lack of funds was, in any way, attributable to the defense.     That's, essentially, what you would like us to say?       Can we clarify one point? Justice Scalia said something about a defendant facing the death penalty going "scot-free."     There was an armed robbery charge that was added in 2007. Do you dispute that a new clock started in 2007, the first time that the robbery charge was -- was made?       But wasn't there something about that motion was withdrawn -- the 2005 motion was withdrawn in 2006?
12-10 +++$+++        Mr. Srinivasan, there isn't -- at least I'm not familiar with anything quite like this, where, if you're not told, if you want to run a government program, you have to speak the government's Page 8 speech. This doesn't require the recipient to speak to anybody at all, except to the government itself, to say, I pledge that my policy is the government's policy. So it's making somebody adopt, as her own, the government's policy, rather than saying, I understand that I get my government money, I have to follow the government's rules about what I can say to the public. Here -- and is -- is there anything else quite like this, where you make a pledge to the government, but with respect to third parties doesn't apply?       Mr. Srinivasan, on this, what does seem to me unusual, as Justice Alito brought out, requiring somebody to say, "I believe this" or "I agree with the government on that."     The Rust v. Page 15 Sullivan, which is one of the precedents on which you rely, made it a point that the doctor was not required to represent -- as his own views, not required to represent an opinion that he doesn't hold. He has to adhere to the government's program in his dealings with the public, but he doesn't have to say, "I agree with the government."       Is that just an irrelevant consideration in Rust, that no one -- no one was being obliged to say, I believe something, that they don't believe?       But, Mr. Srinivasan, there is a difference in this international setting -- you know, most of those separate affiliates was in Taxation Without Representation, and it was the cure for the Legal of Women Voters.     But here, as the D.C. District Court said in its opinion, which was in your favor, oh, all you have to do is spin off a subsidiary that gets the government money; it's just a simple matter of corporate reorganization. But you know that getting an NGO -- a new NGO recognized in dozens of foreign countries is no simple thing to accomplish.     I mean, to take a concrete example, look what happened about a year and a half ago in Egypt, when the U.S. NGOs were indicted for criminal -- for not complying with the permit requirements of the country. Page 19 So it's one thing to set up a 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) operating in the United States, each does its thing.     But to require an NGO to then, in the countries where it's operating, get the necessary permits is quite an arduous thing.       Mr. Srinivasan, that was one -- one -- veterans.     Everybody else was subject to the lobbying restriction.     Here, it's 20 percent of the funds go to the organizations that are free from this pledge.
12-1036 +++$+++       Mr. Massey, with respect to that, there is a claim for restitution.    I take it if the suit is successful, the money that's collected will be distributed to all the people who are affected by this conduct.      Mr. Massey, you envision one proceeding, it could be a class action on behalf of the individuals, that doesn't require everybody tot satisfy the amount in controversy, and then this action by the Attorney General, which does, among other things, seek restitution. Isn't there an overlap between those two claims, and how do we sort out -- you said -- at one point I think you described the restitution as "disgorgement of ill gotten gains."      But now we have the consumers who were affected, they've already been paid. So how does it work for the Attorney General's suit? What is the impact of the class action that has already gone forward and been completed on the Attorney General's claim?      Except we know that's not true in this case because we already have a settled -      Is your -- is your view of what's called the mass action -- a mass action is you have to have a sizeable number of plaintiffs, each one with 75 -- at least $75,000 at stake.    Is that -      And so they would all be named plaintiffs.      Are there many actions of that nature where there are hundreds of people each with a claim of 75,000 or more?      Why would you bring such a claim in Federal courts in this mass action formula? I can see in Mississippi doesn't have class actions, but if you're in Federal court, why would you ever have a mass action instead of a class action?
12-1038 +++$+++    But it is -- it is in the Air Force manual and in a JAG opinion, was the exclusive possession criterion.   Has  since this case has been pending guite a while, has the manual changed, has -- to -- to delete the exclusive possession?   If -- if your position is right, then I -- I think there would be nothing left of Flowers, because Flowers, the government owned that area as well. Is there anything left -- I mean, that -- in this case, the -- the property is used as a public highway, and people go back and forth. In Flowers, it was a street. So are you urging that Flowers is essentially overruled?   And where is this? Where is the exception? Is it -- was it in the bar order?   It could have said  it could have said that Apel can't use the highway. That would -- that dispensation was a matter of grace?   Is that what you're saying?
12-10882 +++$+++    Mr. Waxman, could we just clarify one thing, that what you refer to as the SEM, that is not limited to IQ of 70, 75. That's across the board.   So it has nothing to do with the death penalty and mental retardation --   Retrospectively.   The district court did make a finding that he did not show adaptive behavior, and the district court said that that was so because all of those experts that you've referred to were speaking retrospectively. There was no evidence of what the defendant's current condition was. That was -- I think it's in the Joint Appendix --   Well, what -- there was nothing that limited you to the retrospective proof. The -- the trial judge asked a simple question, how did the defendant adapt in prison, and quotes one expert as saying: "Well, I didn't test for that. I don't know why I didn't do it." And that same expert said that he had, in fact, done it in other cases.   And if it were 76, you would not need to go on to adaptive behavior; is that your view?
12-1117 +++$+++    Would the court, in your view, ever have an occasion to decide whether conduct of this nature violates the Fourth Amendment? If you -- you were right about clearly -- clearly established, then could this -- could the underlying constitutional question ever be, what would be the posture of the case in which it could be decided?
12-1128 +++$+++       Mr. Waxman, what do you make of the patent listing non-infringement as an affirmative defense in an infringement suit?      What you -- what you just responded, that would go as well for an alleged infringer who is not a licensee, right?      This here -- this case is about the difference between the licensee and the non-licensee.      I take it you disagree with the -- we have one friend of the Court brief that says this is not a case arising under the patent law, it arises under contract law.    It's a contract case with a patent issue.
12-1146 +++$+++    Before you do that, can you clarify whether or not you agree with the dissenting judges on the D.C Circuit? That is, if we limit it to criteria pollutants, even so, BACT must be installed for greenhouse gases. You seemed in your main brief to agree with that. You have a footnote saying it's got a heck of a lot of differences. It's 86 percent of the emissions on the Government's theory; 83 on yours. But your reply brief seems to turn 180 degrees from that.   Well, what do you make -- what do you make of the endangerment finding that greenhouse gases have severe effects at the local level that -- I think the endangerment finding is not before us today. The endangerment finding is that they exacerbate ground-level ozone and smog.   What else does it cover other than Title II, other than mobile vehicles?   And what other programs I asked earlier. So we have the mobile vehicles. What else? You're saying it excludes PSD. What else does it --   Can you clarify that? We have the NAAQS criteria. EPA has added many others across the years. For 30 years it's been adding things for which there are no NAAQS. What about all of those?
12-1163 +++$+++    On your reading, Mr. Katyal, I take it that if the district court denies fees, there would be slim to no chance of getting that overturned on appeal if you're dealing with the abuse of -- abuse of discretion.   But if you leave it to the district court that way and the district court denies fees, isn't there a -- a risk of large disparities from district judge to district judge. One will say, yes, I think that this was uncommon, not run of the mine, so I'm going to award fees, and another one of them will say, no, I think it's pretty standard, so I won't award fees.
12-1168 +++$+++    Mr. Rienzi, the problem that the State faced is it doesn't know -- and it has a history, there was a considerable history of disturbances and blocking the entrance, and it doesn't know in advance who are the well-behaved people and who are the people who won't behave well. So -- and after the disturbance occurs, it's too late. So the State is trying to say, We want to make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to everyone. We can't -- we can't screen people to know who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive.   How much is -- how much is restricted? How -- how long does it take from when you enter the buffer zone until you reach the clinic entrance?   So the conversation can go on before those 7 to 10 seconds.   There's not much you're going to be able to do to have a conversation that will persuade people in 7 to 10 seconds.   Well, that's a  a contested point because the Attorney General reads "scope of employment" to mean getting to my job and leaving my job, and does not include speech activity.   This is the -- the chief legal officer of the State says this is a term that needs to be interpreted. The term is "scope of employment." Scope of employment within this statute means getting to work and leaving work, and it doesn't mean political speech.   But it's "such as," it's "such as." It says you can't talk about anything.   Well, it's not content -- it's not based on speech about abortion. It's that you can't speak about anything.
12-1173 +++$+++    I thought this -- the cities were relying on Section 912, as applied to the 1875 Act.   Well, can you explain to me something to me about that 1875 Act a little bit? We know that until 1871, these railroad rights-of-way were considered to leave the government in the position of having a reversionary interest.   And I don't see anything in the 1875 Act statute. There was an end to the giving away of large -- large quantities of land to the railroad, and so that was out. But what is there in the 1875 Act that changes the right-of-way from what it had been up until 1871?   But the railroad wasn't benefited by the end of the 1871 understanding of the right-of-way. The one that was benefited was the government. The government got -- got back the land, so it's not -- we're not -- was going to stop giving land to the railroad, yes, but the beneficiary that is losing out under your interpretation is the government.
12-1182 +++$+++ 
12-1184 +++$+++    You  you had just said that we should return it to the district court with orders to require fee shifting. And how could that be if the discretion is to be exercised by the district court? I can understand your asking for a remand, but I can't understand your asking for a reversal and an order that the fees be reimbursed.   And you think this Court is the proper court to look at the record and make that determination, that the district court got it wrong when the district court didn't think this was an exceptional case.   I think you -- you did say if it's an exceptional case, the district court must award fees, but the statute says may. So even in the exceptional case, according to the statute, the district court is not required to award fees. Or do you read may to mean something else?
12-1200 +++$+++    Why should that matter given that, after the bankruptcy judge ruled, the U.S. District Court gave de novo review to this case and entered a final judgment that met all the reguirements of Article III?   Why would the -- why would the district judge do that when the district court said that there are no disputed issues, no relevant disputed issues of fact and it's a pure legal guestion?   It uses the word "appellate" --   -- in 158?   But the definition -- the definition was linked to a purpose. You-- you laid out very nicely the two categories; the one category where the bankruptcy judge enters a judgment, the other category where the bankruptcy judge makes recommendations. So, if you -- the purpose of the classification was to indicate the bankruptcy judge can make the final judgment, can only make recommendations. Suppose the district judge had said, I'm uncertain after Stern about whether the bankruptcy judge had authority to enter a final judgment. So I am going to treat that summary judgment as a recommendation. I'll treat it as a recommendation and I will review it de novo. I agree, I enter final judgment. If the district judge had said that, then you would have no case, right?
12-123 +++$+++        Am I right in thinking that there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the takings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes, as producers, in the Court of Federal Claims?       Well, jurisdictional --       -- jurisdictional or not, as a practical matter, producers who are not subject to fine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose raisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court of Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken?       But I'd just like a straight answer to that question.     You -- you are representing producers, and they just produce.       I'm saying hypothetically -- hypothetically.     Is the Court of Federal Claims the proper forum for a producer?       Mr. MCConnell, would you explain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't producing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do they have a claim and where?     And if they were just producers -- I take it from the question I asked and the question Justice Kagan asked that if they were just producers, the raisins got set aside, they were paid for only the ones that went to market, they could go to the Court of Claims. But now they're just handlers, as this entity is for most of the raisins that are involved, some 80 percent, right?     It's only about 20 percent is their own.     So could this work for someone who was just a handler, doesn't produce any raisins?       Yes.       What I'm -- I'm trying to understand is this scheme.     Apparently it wasn't enough just to be a handler or just to be a producer.     The claim that you're making turns on the coincidence of being both the producer and a handler.       So any handler, any handler could be making the same claim?       But what do you mean by -- what's the business model that's similar to this?       You said --       Mr. MCConnell, I don't Page 26 want to encroach on your rebuttal time, but one mysterious thing.     The first time around, the Ninth Circuit decided this case on the merits.     So if you're right, I take it, we remand and then they adjudicate the merits of the takings claim.     But they already did that.
12-126 +++$+++        Mr. Bursch, I thought that -- that Perkins -- didn't he say that -- that you could take into account -- I'm looking for the brief -- you could take into account delay as a factor in whether his actual innocence gateway plea should be heard.       What would it take to -- what would it take to show diligence?     And didn't he say that he tried to get a lawyer, several times, and was unsuccessful?       Was that -- was that argued to the -- to the Sixth Circuit?     Did you argue in the Sixth Circuit that, even assuming diligence, there wasn't enough here, and that's what the district court held?       But it -- it was explicitly made to the Sixth Circuit?       Before you present the argument --       -- you are saying that Congress overruled Schlup; is that what -- the point you're making?       Why can't you cross-examine her?     Is it just because the lapse of time and she won't remember?
12-1281 +++$+++    How did it -- how did it affect the -- how many board decisions will have to be redone, or how did -- how is the board coping with that problem?   General Verrilli, we've taken you off your starting point. Your starting point was what is it -- what constitutes a recess. And your position is that it can be an intra-session recess. But if we look back historically, Congress met, and they met continuously. And then they went on horseback back home, and they were away for 6 months, even 9 months. Today, there's nothing like that. The inter-session -- the inter-session recess could be -- could be an hour. So what do we do with that? There was the vision of a long recess running for months, and today, the inter-session recess might be momentary.   But it isn't -- it isn't tied then to the availability of Congress, availability of the Senate. I think you said throughout your brief that the rationale for the recess power is the President must be able to have the government functioning and staffed even though -- although the Senate isn't -- isn't around. But now the -- you seem, in your answers, to be departing from the Senate not available and making quite another justification for this. The Senate -- I think, to be candid, the Senate is always available. They can be called back on very short notice. So what is it that's the constitutional flaw here? It isn't -- it isn't that the Senate isn't available. The Senate is available. It can easily be convened.   You do have -- you do have the one that you relied on in your brief, and this understanding goes back at least to 1823, and the -- the Wirt letter, Attorney General Wirt said, on the wording -- maybe on the wording, the case is not strong. But the purpose, he said, you would be honoring the letter and defying the spirit. That was the -- on the question of the -- when the vacancy --   Before you -- before you --   The  we sort of drifted away from the new -- the new practice, the pro forma session. And you were asked, suppose there was nothing in the resolution about they would conduct no business. It was an informal understanding that they wouldn't. But there is no express agreement that they're not going to conduct business. Then do you lose on that part of the case?
12-1315 +++$+++    On damages as well as injunctive relief? I thought your brief said injunctive relief, but not damages.   Ms. Saharsky, this -- before you sit down, there's one puzzle I'd like you to address for us, and that is your position is damages within the 3 years, okay; injunction, you can adjust for the laches. In the patent area, and also intellectual property, the Federal Circuit has said that laches may bar as it goes -- just the reverse, laches may bar monetary relief, but not injunctive relief. What explains the difference between, in the patent area, no monetary relief, but yes, injunctive relief, and your position in the copyright area, monetary relief but no injunction or a modified injunction?
12-133 +++$+++        Mr. Kellogg, suppose it goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you have to show the relevant market, you have to show that American Express had market power, that it used that power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way these sections -- the way these tying cases have gone is you get an expert.     And I don't see that you can prove it in -- in a new way. I mean, the whole point of this is that the expense to win one of these cases is enormous.     And no single person is not worth that person's while.       What was the -- what was the -- I missed that.     The sharing of the costs, how does that work?     It's certainly not in the agreement, not in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American Express is going to pay for the expert for the other side.       Oh.     Oh.       And then what you would you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they could share?     They could share the million dollar cost of this -- the experts?       I -- I'm sorry, but I don't think I got the answer to my question.     Is -- the arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough. So what happens then, the case ends, and it's not possible --      I thought that the only thing that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay 300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in treble damages is 5,000.    It didn't go into all the other things that you were saying.     It said nobody in his right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000 to get $5,000.       In the AT&T Mobility case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum. Is there anything like that in this arbitration clause?       Yes, where not some other consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration?       Did -- did American Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you need proof is D?     As I understood it, American Express never took the position that it would -- it would concede certain issues so that you could limit the proof.       No, I'm not talking about --       I'm not talking about pooling with other single merchants bringing single arbitrations.     I'm asking whether American Express -- so here's the complaint.     It says, I have to prove relevant markets separately.     And did American Express take the position, no, you don't have to prove all that.     I think that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting.     There's only one thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we could stipulate. But I didn't see anything in all the time this case has been in the courts on American Express's part to say that we are not going to demand the full breadth of proof.       It was because -- it was because Judge Pooler said, "I have been instructed by the Supreme Court that I may not require class arbitration."     That's -- and she was bound by our decision that a court can't order class arbitration, isn't that correct?     So that was not an option for her.       The Second Circuit never said anything about, this is what it would cost in court.     The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is what it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right? It didn't say one word distinguishing what it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in arbitration.     It was simply what it was going to cost.
12-135 +++$+++        But -- about the parties never considering it, when this case was in the New Jersey courts, Oxford explained -- this is in the red brief at page 27 that's quoting Oxford's counsel then, that "the arbitrator has the power to ascertain whether the parties contemplated class arbitration in their agreements."     A power in the arbitrator that Oxford does not contest.     Does it -- that seems to be a recognition by Oxford that -- that class arbitration was contemplated.       But there was no -- in Stolt-Nielsen, the parties stipulated that the contract said nothing on the issue of class proceeding.     In this case, we have no such stipulation --       -- and the arbitrator is interpreting a term of the contract, the ordinary rule is that -- that the arbitration -- arbitrator's interpretation of a contract term, wrong or right, unless it's off the wall, is -- is not to be overturned.       It was a combination of the two provisions.     He said that everything that is excluded by the first provision is included in the second.     And he also said something, which may or may not be so.     He said that this particular way of describing the -- the -- what's arbitrable, this is an unusual wording.     We have -- there's no civil action in the first clause and then arbitration in the second.     He said that he had never seen this particular language. Is he wrong in -- in saying that this language is unusual?       Was this -- was this a -- well, was this an experienced arbitrator?       Well, of course, this was -- this was an adhesion contract, so there's no -- it was drafted by Oxford.     And you made a point about betting the house, that the company wouldn't have agreed to it.     But on the side of the doctor, he has a $10,000 -- a $1,000 claim, and he is saying that without a class proceeding, there is -- there is essentially no means to enforce the contract against Oxford, that none of these parties, none of the, what was it, 13,000 doctors, none of them could enforce the contract because the expense would be much greater than the $1,000 they could get at the end.
12-1371 +++$+++    I have no problem with the description of what Congress had in mind, reaching conduct that was prosecuted only as a misdemeanor. But the -- the words that Congress used has, as an element, the use of physical force. Under the Tennessee statute, as I understand it, you don't have to have physical force. You have to cause bodily injury to another, which could be caused by a means other than physical force.   Yes.
12-138 +++$+++    Mr. Goldstein, you have given us three parts for an opinion.   Is it your position, essentially, that, under this bilateral agreement, the case is to be decided by an arbitrator, not by a court in Argentina or the United States? And so the guestion is when an arbitrator will decide the case. And so the guestion of when doesn't say whether it's an agreement or not. It just says, that you sued too early, you started it -- you started too early. Is that your essential position, that this bilateral agreement says arbitration is the way this dispute gets decided, and everything on the way to that is what you call a preliminary guestion, but, essentially, the parties have agreed that their disputes will be solved by arbitration?   Isn't that the same thing in France, which is supposed to be a popular place for international arbitration, that, in the first instance, the arbitrator decides, but, ultimately, the court can review everything?   How do we know that? How do we know that? The question is, is this litigation preliminary -- going to the Argentinian court, is the litigation preliminary a condition on the consent to arbitrate a dispute? What is the answer to that question, in the view of the United States?   Alright, so you've done all that. And what does the United States -- the United States is saying, court, you should look to all these sources, and then answer the question, is the litigation preliminary a condition on consent to arbitrate the dispute? So, after looking at the sources that the United States is telling the court it should look to, what is the answer of the United States to that question?
12-1408 +++$+++    Well, don't we have a decision that says that the -- the term "wages" should be interpreted the same way for FICA purposes and income tax?   I have a question about the effect of the government's position. In the States, if these -- if we say these benefits qualify as wages for FICA purposes, then what about the States that say we will supply unemployment compensation only if there is not another source of unemployment compensation?   How about that we should just ignore their revenue rulings, including the current one, and just deal with the statute? Is that what you are suggesting?   And then what happens to the State compensation schemes which the revenue rulings seem to have been trying to accommodate?
12-142 +++$+++        And she didn't take -- she didn't take the -- the brand-name drug because the pharmacist gave her the generic, but she didn't know brand, generic, isn't that correct?       Mr. -- Mr. Lefkowitz, then what you are saying is that the FDA's approval is not only what everyone agrees it is, a floor to enable you to market, but it is also a ceiling.     That is you meet the FDA -- you get the FDA approval and that gives you a right to market, not simply an access to market, but it -- it operates as a ceiling?       Is there something in the -- in the Act that says that the States have no role with respect to the safety and efficacy of the drug -- the drug, it's only the FDA approval, that's it?       Did you get to the jury's -- to the instructions to the jury?       So that's what the jury was supposed to apply, not what counsel said.       But you just said there was nothing wrong with the jury instructions, at least you didn't object.       How -- how did the Court reject it?     They threw out the failure to warn claim.
12-144 +++$+++        Have we ever granted standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?       Well, this is -- this is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's passed, they have no proprietary interest in it.     It's law for them just as it is for everyone else.     So how are they distinguishable from the California citizenry in general?       Mr. Cooper, Baker v. Nelson was 1971.     The Supreme Court hadn't even decided that gender-based classifications get any kind of heightened scrutiny.       And the same-sex intimate conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971, so I don't think we can extract much in Baker v. Nelson.       California -- no, California does.       It wouldn't be in California, Mr. Cooper, because that's not an issue, is it?     In California, you can have same-sex couples adopting a child.       Mr. Cooper, you are defending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to California only, not to all of the States.       Mr. Cooper, we said that somebody who is locked up in prison and who is not going to get out has a right to marry -- has a fundamental right to marry, no possibility of procreation.       Yes.       I thought he was saying -- I thought he was saying, Mr. Cooper, that it's not before the Court today.     And remember Loving against Virginia was preceded by the MCLaughlin case.     So first there was the question of no marriage, and then there was marriage. So in that sense I understood the Solicitor General to be telling us that case is not before the Court today.       I think it was MCLaughlin v. Florida.       It was cohabitation of people of different races.       And the Court took that case and waited to reach the marriage case.       I may -- my memory may be wrong, but I think the case was that people of different races were arrested and charged with the crime of interracial cohabitation.     And the Court said that that was invalid.       Unlawful.
12-1493 +++$+++    But this -- this family member, the uncle, residing in Pennsylvania, he could not have purchased that gun in Virginia, isn't that right, because he's a nonresident?   But wouldn't he -- wouldn't he have to comply with the 552(c), which says how somebody who doesn't show up in person can purchase a gun? And none of those requirements were satisfied here. So it seems to me that what you're asking is just an end run around what Congress said. If you're out of State and you want to buy it, this is how you have to do it.   In Virginia.
12-158 +++$+++       But, Mr. Clement, you said that -- that the treaty is valid and the implementing legislation seems to largely copy the words of the treaty without adding anything.    So, it's a puzzle that the treaty could be constitutional, but the implementing legislation that adds nothing is unconstitutional.      Mr. Clement, there's an irony in what you just said, because the victim, many times, went to the State police and said, please help me.    And they turned her away a dozen times.    And finally they said, go to the post office.    So this doesn't seem to be -- you're arguing that this trenches on the State's domain.    And, yet, in this very case, it wasn't until the State referred her to the post office, Federal officials, that she got any action.
12-167 +++$+++        May -- may I ask you a question about that?     It's plain error because the defendant didn't make an objection in the lower court. But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his lawyer wants him to plea.     So he lacks the information necessary to make a prompt objection. So it seems a bit unfair to say that he's subjected to plain error when he hasn't got a clue that the judge -- magistrate wasn't supposed to do what he did.       But this is a lawyer that had filed an Anders brief.     So he didn't -- even at that stage, the lawyer, the -- I don't want to absorb your time beyond this, but I think the plain error is questionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer, they arranged against the -- the defendant, and the defendant doesn't know that he has this route.       Mr. Feigin, is there any situation in which a -- a judge participating in a plea bargaining, any situation that would be prejudicial - that you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is can you describe what that would be?       What -- what makes it prejudicial and this not?       On that point, do we know -- do we know if the district judge who did preside at the plea hearing knew about the episode with the magistrate 3 months earlier?       The same for the prosecutor?
12-17 +++$+++       Can you -- can you explain that business a little more fully than you did in the briefs?    He's in the business of collecting records from all the States about tax assessments.      And he -- and he does that for a client who could very well ask himself.     So what is the service that's being performed?      How much -- how much of an impact, in fact, does it have on his business?    I mean, there are 47 States who will provide this information.      But the point is that FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens should know what their government is doing.    And you don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part of that political community.     Now, Virginia doesn't allow people from out-of-State to vote.    They're not part of Virginia's political community. So why isn't this -- if you're not part of the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA, which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't have to give any reason for it.      But if it costs for Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and, if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's going to cost the State.    It's going to have to hire people to do this.    They're going to have to spend many hours going through these records, so the State doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its own people.      Then you would be doing something very strange with this statute because you would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because it's his business.     But the statute, the character of this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the information for. But you're saying the out-of -- the in-Stater, it doesn't matter.    Out-of-Stater, is it your argument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's business, so you -- you're changing the character of a FOIA statute, which is it doesn't matter what you want it for.      Are you leaving out -       Are you leaving it - you -- you switched now to-- and you were led there, but you switched to the dormant Commerce Clause.    What about your other client, MCBurney?    He doesn't have any dormant Commerce Clause claim.
12-207 +++$+++        How about a Terry stop? A Terry stop?       But these -- these are all cases -- I mean, the dominant use is to solve what they call cold -- cold cases, and you gave one example. This case is another.     A rape committed 6 years before, right? And there was no reasonable suspicion, there was no -- nothing, right?     And the suspicion comes up only because the DNA sample comes back as a match.     So is it the -- this is a very reliable tool, but it's not based on any kind of suspicion of the individual who's being subjected to it, right?       Mr. Dreeben, can you explain how it works, mechanically?     Because I understand -- at least maybe this is just the Maryland statute, but if you can't use the swab that is taken from the arrestee when he is arrested -- it can't be used, it's inadmissible -- then you do it again.     You do it -- but what it does supply is probable cause because you found out that he was a perpetrator of a rape 6 years ago. Then you have probable cause and you get a warrant and do it again.     What -- what is the reason for the doubling -- the doing it twice?
12-236 +++$+++        There are other -- there are other provisions that refer to a petition filed. For example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing a notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to any petition filed.     And so in those sections at least, petition filed would include petition filed after the running of the statute of limitations. Page 5       But don't you -- don't you put in the Federal Register and report to Congress petitions that had been filed out of time?       Well, think about the Federal Register.       So they don't file anything in the Federal Register?       So using Federal rules as your model, and Federal rules list statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.     Ordinarily, that's what it is.     But is it an affirmative -- well, certainly it's an affirmative defense to any award of compensation under the Vaccine Act. But what makes it an affirmative defense to the award of fees?       Why not --       But there's a lot of information just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what has to be put in the petition.     And there's -- couldn't -- couldn't a Special Master make the determination based on that?
12-246 +++$+++        Why isn't it -- why isn't it like the -- is it Berghuis case?     There was a case of someone who was given Miranda warnings, and, even so, the Court said he was silent.     He didn't invoke the Fifth Amendment; therefore, his silence can be commented on.       Mr. Fisher, but then - do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he was shuffling his feet.
12-25 +++$+++        It says, "anticipation of litigation in connection" --       Not only ongoing litigation, but it can be used in connection with anticipation of litigation.       Do you recognize that you could use (b)(4) to identify class members?       So -- so if it's -- if it's a solicitation, suppose this information was a -- the recent automobile purchaser was asked:     Did you buy a car recently?     Were you charged this additional fee? Period.     That would be okay?       That would come under (b)(4)?       That's why -- would you -- I want to make sure I understood your prior answer.     You said, I thought, that it would have been okay to get the information from the bureau and then ask, did you buy a car recently?     Did you have this additional charge?     Now, suppose -- you said that was all right?       Well, isn't that -- wasn't that crystal-clear here?     Because the dealers were saying, you can't go forward unless you have a plaintiff to match every dealer.     You're trying to bring a representative action, but your list of plaintiffs, none of them bought from Dealer Z.     So we are investigating to see if we can have a representative action with a line-up of plaintiffs, each of whom has purchased from a list of defendants.       Well, suppose we had -- what -- it was limited to did you buy the car, did you pay the fee?     And then somebody who --       We -- we have just those questions, no -- are you interested in joining a lawsuit, please call us.     But somebody who receives this notice, it just asks, did you buy a car, did you pay the charge, then calls the lawyer's office and says, tell me something about this letter that you told me -- that you -- you sent to me. And how does the lawyer answer?       It doesn't necessarily follow --       -- that they -- they are describing only what goes on in the court.     If you just took the phrase "investigation in anticipation of litigation," "in anticipation of" sounds like before litigation begins.       I don't know why this case doesn't fit that description because the -- the position that the dealers were taking was you can't -- you ought to maintain a representative action.     The State has such an animal, it's not quite a class action, representative action.     To qualify, the group must be numerous. So how am I going to find out if it's numerous, without asking these questions?       Might that get the lawyer into some difficulty with the Bar Association?     They'll look at this and say, look, we told you, if you are -- if you are seeking clients, then you have to put advertising material.     And a letter like that would tip the recipient off to something is going on, I should find out about it, and maybe I should join it.       But then there is a whole string of defendants who were doing the same thing -- the same allegedly unlawful practice, they couldn't reach without getting additional plaintiffs.       But their client is a -- is a group.     This -- this is not an individual action --       The statute says sue for the benefit of the whole.
12-3 +++$+++       All employees or would you limit it --      -- to the ones that had a hand in executing the contract?      But it came up.    I mean, we are reviewing a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.    And this Spinner case from the ARB postdates.    We have a district court, a court of appeals.    Chevron didn't raise its head until after the First Circuit was through with the case.    So how does Chevron come into this particular case?
12-307 +++$+++        Does that include the -- does that include the courts of appeals or just this Court?       Mr. Clement, the problem is that it would totally tort the States' decision that there is a marriage between two people, for the Federal government then to come in to say no joint return; no marital deduction; no Social Security benefits; your spouse is very sick, but you can't get leave; people -- if that set of attributes, one might well ask, what kind of marriage is this?       How about divorce?     Same thing?     That you can have a Federal notion of divorce, and that that doesn't relate to what the State statute is?       They're not -- they're not a question of additional benefits.     I mean, they touch every aspect of life.     Your partner is sick. Social Security -- I mean, it's pervasive.     It's not as though, well, there's this little Federal sphere and it's only a tax question. It's -- it's -- as Justice Kennedy said, ,100 statutes, and it affects every area of life.     And so you are really diminishing what the State has said is marriage.     You're saying, no, State did two kinds of marriage, the full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage. (Laughter.)       Rational basis, Mr. Clement -- is a problem in your briefing.     You seem to say and you repeat it today that there is three tiers, and if you get into rational basis, then it's anything goes.     But the history of this Court is, in the very first gender discrimination case, Reed v. Reed, the Court did something it had never done in the history of the country under rational basis.     There was no intermediate tier then.     It was rational basis.       And yet the Court said this is rank discrimination and it failed.
12-315 +++$+++    Can  can we go back to your response to Justice Scalia? You said that the Respondents conceded, but -- but isn't it the case that it was the Colorado supreme court that said that the airline likely would have been immune if they had phrased the report more cautiously?   So it's -- it's the Colorado supreme court, not the Respondent?   But did the jury -- did the jury find falsity? Do you recognize that? Did this jury find that the statement was, as you say, materially false?   And how did -- how did they make it? Because the only thing I see is the special verdict sheet and it doesn't ask that guestion.
12-357 +++$+++        But it's -- the coercion crime, at least under New York definition, requires force.     And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an embarrassing fact. So what -- am I right about that, that the coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State crime, requires a threat of force to restrict another's freedom?       What about -- you said transfer, sell, but there's also exercise.     And the theory is that the defendant sought to take away the officer's right to make this recommendation, take it away from the officer, exercise it himself.     So why doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right taken from one and exercised by another?       Is this -- there is, I take it, no Federal crime that this conduct would fit? You said New York State has a coercion crime which you say this conduct might fit.     But there's no Federal crime.       And why did -- why did New York -- was the New York case dropped and the State officials urged the Government, the Federal Government, to make this a Federal case?
12-398 +++$+++        Mr. Hansen, Respondents say that isolating or extracting natural products, that has long been considered patentable, and give - examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine.     How is this different from -- those start with natural - natural products.       Mr. Hansen, you answered my initial question by saying they start -- everything starts with a national -- natural product, but these others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve manipulation.     The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as involving manipulation?
12-399 +++$+++        But he didn't.     I mean, he -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights to the mother, but not to a stranger.     And when the issue of adoption came up, he said, "Yes, I want to assert my parental rights."       Where does it -- where is there a reference in the definition of "parent" to a State law?     I see the -- which is the section which defines a parent?       Yes.       It says a parent means a biological parent of an Indian child and he fits that definition.     And then the next section -- the next sentence doesn't have any reference to State law.       Doesn't 1915 preclude the adoptive parents because they're not in the preferred category?     If 1915(a) precludes the adoption, then the adoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting to an award to the father.       It's not listed under the -- there are guidelines for what constitutes good cause.       What about now, when you said the best interest.     Now the child has been some months with the father.     So if a best interest calculus is made now, you would have to take into account uprooting that relationship, would you not?       Even though -- even though the guidelines to what's good cause do not include best interest.       That might is what provoked the Act that Indian children were being removed from their families, but the Act is written in much broader terms.
12-414 +++$+++        May I just ask a question about what you just said?     The record does show that Toca came into the case very late in the day, and he asked to have a postponement because he said, I have to get up to speed.     I don't know anything about this case. So Toca, himself, is saying, I'm not acquainted with the case -- with the case.       When you say the record is silence -- silent, I am looking at the Joint Appendix, page 295, and this is Titlow's statement.     "I would have testified against my...had I not been persuaded to withdraw my plea agreement because an attorney promised me he would represent me.     He told me he could take my case to trial and win." So that sounds like she was persuaded by Mr. Toca to go to trial because she could win.     And he had, at that point, not made any appraisal of the case.       Why -- why -- you made the point that this plea bargain could not be carried out once the number one condition, the prosecutor said, you testify against your aunt, and then we'll give you this deal.     Once the aunt is tried and she doesn't testify, there's no -- there's no plea bargain. So why isn't that enough to decide this case?     If you can't tell a prosecutor to renew a bargain that can't be carried out, then it's become impossible.
12-416 +++$+++        Mr. Stewart, does this represent a change in the government's position?     I got the idea from the briefs that at the time of this Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh Circuit, that the government was not taking that position it is now taking.
12-417 +++$+++       But we're dealing with here, from the picture, that looks like clothes to me.      Mr. Schnapper, can I ask you another question?    We're talking about time and whether it will be paid.    And we have one worker that puts on this protective garb.    And then we have another, the baker.    It takes them about the same amount of time to do -- put on everything he has to put on.    But everybody agrees, he doesn't get paid for that.    What is the -- that that would come within the clothing. So we have all kinds of people who have to wear special uniforms, a doorman in an apartment house. It takes them time to put it on.    Why should there be a distinction in getting paid between the protective garb and something that you must wear on the job?    That - yes.
12-418 +++$+++        Mr. Dreeben, you say nothing about the -- what was the opening argument in -- Page 25 in your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is something new added after is wrong because there were these predecessor laws that established a Federal requirement to register.
12-43 +++$+++        Mr. Clement, is there another example -- Justice Kennedy mentioned that this was what they call "one-off."     It's one time only, and it's retrospective.     Is -- is there any instance in which a foreign tax credit has been given to something that looks like this, a one-time only adjustment that is -- that operates retrospectively on past earnings?
12-462 +++$+++    Mr. Clement, the argument was made that if -- if the airline has an unreviewable right to terminate this agreement for any reason or for no reason, if that is so, then it's an illusory contract. What -- what is your answer to that, if one party can get out willy-nilly, why -- what kind of bargain is it?   How about Minnesota? In Minnesota, isn't it just a rule of construction of the contract?   You said, "in some States." So what about the States where that doesn't? Are you saying that, in some States, the implied covenant is assumed to be what the parties agreed upon, and, in some States, it's not?   Suppose the State --   If we had --
12-464 +++$+++        Does it?     There are several factors that are taken into account.     One of them is weight of the evidence.     Are you equating those two things, probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense and weight of the evidence as one of several factors, to take account over the bail determination?       Right to be heard -       If your -- if your position prevails, there would be nothing to stop the defendant from using those assets for something other than paying an attorney.     If the assets are unfrozen, freely available to the defendant, the defendant might say, I will settle for a legal aid lawyer, I want to use this money for something that I care more about.     It - there would be no control on that, would there?       And how do you get at -       But then there -- then there is the anomaly that the grand jury has said there is probable cause, this defendant can be prosecuted, and then you would have the judge make a determination that there isn't probable cause to believe.     You are asking a judge who has determined there is no probable cause to preside at a trial because the grand jury has found that there is probable cause. And how -- how could a judge allow a trial to go on?     If the judge concludes there is no probable cause to arrest this defendant for this crime, how could the judge then conduct a trial?     The judge would be overriding the grand jury's determination, right?       Wouldn't the next step be that the judge would then dismiss the indictment?     The judge has found there is no probable cause to charge this man with this offense.     And yet, you're going to ask that same judge to try the case that -- it would seem to me that the logic of your position is, if there is to be this hearing on probable cause and the judge finds that there is no probable cause, then the judge dismisses the indictment. How could you ask a judge who thinks there is no probable cause to then conduct a trial.       But you said something about plainly tainted assets.     I thought that the hearing was given on the traceability of the assets to the crime.     So on that part, the defendant isn't allowed to challenge the connection between the assets and the offense, right?       Everybody agrees with that.     So there is a possibility to say, you said we have untainted assets, but the defendant in this case said, I concede that these assets are related to the charged offense.       Did you say that, in this case, because counsel had been retained two years earlier, that the court was presented with how much the lawyer was going to charge to represent the defendants at trial?       The -- the dollar amount was known, so that the court could then say, well, we'll unfreeze assets to that extent but no more.       What was -- what was the figure?     Counsel was identified.       What was -- what was the amount of money that the defendants wanted spared from the seizure order?
12-484 +++$+++        In the -- in the AIDS discrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference between the discrimination claim itself and the retaliation. They'd both be governed by the same standard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination area, the but-for causation.     Or am I wrong about that?       Yes.       But your argument is that, in Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination claim, you're going to have a different standard for retaliation. So, in these statutes, I thought these two traveled together, whatever the standard is for discrimination is the same for retaliation.       Well, it seems that the overall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions of this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted Title VII properly. And am I right that what they put about motivating factor -- a motivating factor, that is more plaintiff-friendly than the -- than the standard that the Court declared in -- in Price Waterhouse?       So it's -- it's really odd to think that, in wanting to go beyond what we did in Price Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an entirely different standard for -- for retaliation.       Well, even looking - let's look at what they actually did.     If we look at this (m) section, it says, "except as otherwise provided in this subchapter."     I take it that would include retaliation as well, in the subchapter.       "An unlawful employment practice is established."     And then, when we go over to the retaliation provision, it says, "It shall be an unlawful employment practice." So why doesn't that suggest that the -- "an employment practice" under the retaliation provision is the same as "an employment practice" under this -       The EEOC didn't.
12-515 +++$+++    Before you do that, can you tell -- tell us why Michigan didn't resort to the dispute resolution means that the compact provided? The compact said, if there's a dispute, it'll be decided by arbitration. Michigan bypassed that.   That's -- all that -- the enigma that you pointed out -- or the anomaly is -- is certainly clear. But what about Kiowa? This Court seemed to say that the tribe is immune on reservation, off reservation, commercial activity, government activity, it is immune, blanket immunity. So how can you prevail without having this Court modify Kiowa.   But once the Congress didn't respond, the majority opinion in Kiowa -- I don't know whether it's "Kiowa" or "Kiowa" -- said -- you know, this is an unfortunate result, but Congress can do something about it. Well, now Congress hasn't done anything about it, and you are asking this Court, essentially, to modify the -- that precedent.
12-5196 +++$+++    I don't follow that, because I thought that $75,000 would go to satisfy part of the claim, that there would still be the legal fees unpaid.   Yes. But now the -- the trustee, who is obliged to try to find what assets he or she can, spends a huge amount of money in order to -- to prove that this claim of a second mortgage was false. And -- and there should be -- so what happens then, on your theory, that all that money was spent and the result is that the second mortgage is canceled; the creditors are satisfied? Nobody pays the legal expenses. Is that --   Are you saying that he must spend the $75,000 on a new residence within how many -- what period of time?   6 months. And if at the end of 6 months he can't find a home at that price, then what happens?   Then if 6 months runs, and he hasn't purchased a new home, then the $75,000 goes where?   They have been paid already.   So then what you said before needs to be modified. He does get to keep the $75,000 because there is no creditors to be paid off from.
12-52 +++$+++        Mr. Bouffard, this law, this New Hampshire law, it regulates storage.     Is this a Page 4 law that applies only to the towing companies who tow the automobile and then store it, or does the law apply, say, to a garage, say, someone brings a car to a garage for repairs, and does this storage law regulate garage operations as well as towing operations?       So -- so it would apply to a garage operator.       Yes, but what made it abandoned was that they tried to locate the owner, couldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a garage owner as happened to the towing truck.     So there's nothing peculiar about being in the towing business that makes this storage application -- storage statute apply.       When?     When did that opportunity come up?     Because I thought that the notice didn't get to the -- to the plaintiff, and then when the lawyer said, I have a client, it's his car, then the towing company went ahead and put it up for auction. And then no bidders, so they sold it, pocketed the money, gave nothing to the car owner.     So I don't understand how it's a dispute about payment.     This is not a case where the car owner said I won't pay for the towing.       At what point did Pelkey say, I won't pay for the towing?       But why should the tow operation be treated any different from the garage when they're doing the identical thing, that is, storing and then selling the vehicle?       But it also tells how the vehicle will be sold -- sold, and your client is invoking that statute in order to be able to sell the car, but wants to have enforced only the parts that are favorable to the tow operation.     And the -- the regime Page 51 in New Hampshire is, yes, you can sell the vehicle, but this is how you do it.     And it seems to me that that's not how it was done here.
12-536 +++$+++        Ms. Murphy -       Ms. Murphy, on the "everyone else," can you give us an idea of whose expression is at stake?     I mean, most people couldn't come even near the -- the limit.     So what percentage - is there any information on what percentage of all contributors are able to contribute over the aggregate -       Mr. Burchfield, I'd like you to address this question about the restriction on speech.     It has been argued that these limits promote expression, promote democratic participation because what they require the candidate to do is, instead of concentrating fundraising on the super-affluent, the candidate would then have to try to raise money more broadly in the electorate. So that, by having these limits, you are promoting democratic participation, then the little people will count some, and you won't have the super-affluent as the speakers that will control the elections.       Has it worked out that way in practice?     Has it worked out -- because there was one brief at least saying no, that -- that that's wrong. In fact, it's the challengers who are aided.       But he can -- he can write checks to everyone that he wants to write checks to.     It's just he can't give his special number of 1776.       In his own case, it would be something over $1,000, right?     Because he identified 12 more candidates that he'd like to give 1776 to, but he could give each of them over $1,000.
12-547 +++$+++        Well, what -       There was some law in effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973 till the year 2001.     There was no statute, and there was no ancient common law.     But what was it?     If I asked you the question, what was the law in Michigan on diminished capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you respond?       How -- how was the Michigan Court of Appeals construing the defense?     Did it say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute.       Counsel, what about the Michigan Court of Appeals?     There's only one court of appeals, right?       And so that court, several times, recognized diminished capacity as a defense.       The -       Your colleague said that there were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's the court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished capacity as a defense.       Is this -- is this a one of a kind, in that, whatever the law was, it's clear from 2001 on?     Are -- are there any other people who were similarly situated, who committed a crime before , but were tried after?       Why -- why was it -       Why was it the right case?     The parties didn't even raise it, did they?
12-562 +++$+++        Mr. Stewart, can you explain the difference in the two proceedings?     First, your position that the proper review is of the final partnership administrative adjustment. How would the penalty be adjudicated in that format, and if your -- if the taxpayer is right, that the adjudication must be made at the partner level proceeding, what would be the difference in the character of the adjudication?       Using the language of the statute that you just quoted, can you explain to us what is the adjustment of the partnership item?     That is, the statute says, "Determine the applicability of any penalty which relates to the adjustment of a partnership item."     So what is -- what was the partnership item adjustment?       Mr. Stewart -       If we -- if we go over to the merits, if this case came up today, and today, we have a penalty that wasn't there originally and that is for a non -- noneconomic substance penalty, would - would the government today be going under that noneconomic substance penalty or would it be going under the 6626(d)(3), that is the substantial valuation misstatement? Or is it the government's option, it can pick one or the other?       If the government could choose either one, what would determine its choice?
12-574 +++$+++       It's not likely, is it, considering if the Bivens claim was created by this Court and not Congress?      You -- you would not have any problem about -- assuming we agree with you that it's -- there's no personal jurisdiction, it's the wrong venue, for the district court in Nevada to transfer the case to the Federal district court in Georgia?      But didn't they say they were residents in both places, in both California and Nevada?      But it was -- it was stated as a separate claim, and I think Judge Grisholm read it that way and I don't think Petitioner has taken issue with that.    That there's -- one claim is for the seizure, another claim is for the false affidavit.    So the seizure stops the funds immediately and then the false affidavit keeps them there. So I didn't think there was a -- a genuine difference between the parties on whether the affidavit -- knowingly composing a false affidavit is an independent claim.
12-609 +++$+++        General -- general -       But he -- the defendant would have to introduce the issue of his mental state, either by his own testimony or an expert, but there's an oddity about this case. Do I understand correctly, General Schmidt, that, if there had never been a Federal proceeding, if this case had proceeded from start to finish in the Kansas courts, there would have been no Welner evidence, there would have been no prosecution expert, because it wouldn't have been allowed under Kansas's own rules?       This -- this case was voluntary intoxication and -- and under Kansas procedure, the -- the prosecution could not have called a witness absent insanity or a mental disease; is that right?       One issue is whether the expert, the government's expert, went beyond the scope of the direct, the experts for the defendant.     That's an open -- that would be an open issue because I think Rule -- the Federal Rule 12.2 is very clear that the rebuttal testimony cannot exceed the scope of the defense expert's testimony.       Isn't that an academic question in this case?     After all, this expert for the government came in when the case was in the Federal system.     The Federal system has a rule that, when the defense puts on an expert, the government can counter it. So the -- the limit would be -- I mean, Kansas doesn't provide for this?     The Federal Rules provide for it in a very limited way.     So to talk about using it beyond the scope of the Federal rule seems to me not the case that's before us.       Are you suggesting that the government can answer in -- in a like manner as the defendant?     The defendant opens the door by experts, then the government can call experts?     That is not to say that a defendant simply offers his own testimony, the government can do something that -- that the defense has not opened the door to.
12-62 +++$+++        The real formula is -- significantly increased the risk of perform -- of prolonging the defendant's incarceration.     That's the standard you would like us --       And is -- is the heart of your argument that there really isn't much difference at all in what district judges are doing, now that the guidelines are discretionary, than what they did when they were mandatory; that is, most of them will start with and stop with the guidelines. I think that's --       But that was in the -- that Florida case was the mandatory -- almost mandatory guideline, and I think our starting point is -- your starting point, too -- is that, when the guidelines were mandatory, it was ex post facto because our decision in the Florida case said it was. Is this sufficiently different now that the guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory?
12-682 +++$+++        Mr. Bursch, could you go back -       But there -- there was no proof that there was any de jure segregation in Seattle.       But there is such a claim in this case, it just wasn't decided -- wasn't there a racial animus, that the reason for Proposition 2 was to reduce the minority population?     The court of appeals didn't get to that, but there was such a claim.       Mr. Bursch, can I ask you to go back to the very first thing you said because I didn't get your -- your point.     The question, what impact has the termination of affirmative action had on Michigan, on the enrollment of minorities in the University of Michigan?     Do we have any clear picture of that, what effect the repeal of affirmative action has had?       Mr. Bursch, isn't -       -- isn't the position that was taken in Seattle derived from a different view of the Equal Protection Clause?     I mean, strict scrutiny was originally put forward as a protection for minorities -- a protection for minorities against hostile disadvantageous legislation.     And so the view then was we use strict scrutiny when the majority is disadvantaging the minority.     So you do, under the Carolene Products view, you do focus on race and you ask, is the minority being disadvantaged? If that were the view, then I suppose we would not be looking at this, well, the criterion is race and wherever the disadvantage falls, whether a majority or minority, it's just the same.     That wasn't the original idea of when strict scrutiny is appropriate.     So if we were faithful to that notion, that it is -- measures a disadvantage the -- the minority that get strict scrutiny.       You said that the district court found it was clear that there was no - there was no discriminatory intent, but that wasn't reviewed on appeal.       You quoted -- you quoted from Crawford.       And there is an opposing quote in Seattle itself on page, what is it, 486?       "When the State's allocation of power places unusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation designed to overcome the special condition of prejudice, the governmental action seriously curtails the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied on to protect minorities." And it quotes Carolene Products.     So -- and then the following sentence is:     "In the most direct sense, this implicates the judiciary's special role, not of treating the individuals as individuals, but the judiciary's special role in safeguarding the interests of those groups that are relegated to a position of political powerlessness." So the rationale of Seattle is that notion that we can't put hurdles in the way of a disadvantaged minority.
12-696 +++$+++       Well, the question -      But the question, Mr. Hungar -      But your position is that wouldn't matter, as I understand, because you have - you have -- you have two limitations, proselytizing and disparaging.    And -- but I think Justice Kagan's question just set place -- place limitations.    One could read your brief and say, well, it doesn't matter; it could be an executive body, it could be a court, it could be a town meeting, a school board, a zoning board, a utilities board.    That's -- is this case about prayer at the beginning of a legislative session or is it about prayer in all three branches of government?      Is there -- is there any constitutional historical practice with respect to this hybrid body?    It's not simply a legislature.    It has a number of administrative functions.    Sometimes it convenes as a town meeting.    Sometimes it entertains zoning applications.    Is there a history for that kind of hybrid body, as there is for the kind of legislature we had in Nebraska or our Congress?      Mr. Gershengorn, your - your brief is the one who brought up -- and you were quite candid about it -- the hybrid nature of that body. I think it's on pages 22 to 24 of your brief.    And you say it would be proper to have certain checks in that setting.    So for one, make sure that the entrance and the exit is easy.    For another, inform the people in town of the tradition so they won't be confused. But you recognize on the one hand that this isn't like Congress or the Nebraska legislature, and then you say these would be nice things to do.    Are you saying just that it would be good and proper or are you saying it would be necessary given the hybrid nature of this body?
12-71 +++$+++        But it did -- but Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled. And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation subject to -- to the penalty of perjury.     So it's not as though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship. It did.     And it said this is the way we deal with citizenship.     Then Arizona adds something else. So I would like, General Horne, for you to respond to a question that's already been raised in -- Page 6 by the -- the panel that decided this case originally, which was, the statute said -- says each State must accept and use the Federal form, period.     That's the end of it. And then it says, in addition to that, the State can do other things.     The judge who asked that question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the Federal form, and if you want to do something in addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form and not add something to it.       General Horne, there -- there are a whole list of State-specific requirements that get appended to the form.     And I think Justice Scalia was raising the question, did you ask to have Arizona's requirement -- just as the other State-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal Commission to include, as a State-specific requirement, this proof of citizenship?
12-729 +++$+++        How much time was left in this case?       And you -- and if there were a one-year limitation running from the final administrative review, you would be out?       Yes, but if there were such a rule, one year from the final administrative decision, this claim would become too late.       Yes.     Yes.       What accounts for the delay?     When the -- the clock was running and more than a year went by before this suit was instituted, why was that -- why did that happen?       But ERISA itself contains no statute of limitations, and it's generally assumed that, therefore, this State statute of limitations would govern, and if a State has the position that parties can contract the statute of limitations -- I mean, ERISA does have -- does have a statute of limitations for breach of fiduciary claims, right?       And it has none for this kind of claim.       I didn't understand your response to Justice Breyer's question, Mr. Wessler.     I don't see how a Federal court who simply stays its - stays its hand, abides the termination of the administrative proceeding, is in any way engaging in any kind of adversary process.       Yes, many people in the administrative process aren't represented, but some are, right?       How -- in practice -- in practice, how often is that the case that the -- that the guidelines set by the Department of Labor are not - are not met?       But, Ms. Anders, the question is -- there is a division in the courts of appeals, and the question is:     Could the Department of Labor, by regulation, resolve the matter one way or the other? Does -- even if -- even if it thinks the statute is clear, the courts obviously don't because most go the other way.     So given that most courts go the other way, does the Department of Labor have authority to adopt a -- a regulation that would adopt the accrual rule?       What is your position on Justice Breyer's suggestion that the trigger can be proof -- when you file proof of claim, but if it happens that beginning of suit at that point would -- while the -- while the administrative review process is underway, why not say you have to follow the time of filing, but if the administrative process -- in your case, the 4 years -- took 4 years -- just hold the suit in abeyance until the administrative process is complete?
12-751 +++$+++    Mr. Long, there is no presumption written into this statute. There is an exception from the diversification reguirements in ESOP. The whole object is to buy the company's stock, and so you don't need to diversify. But apart from that, the statutory reguirement on loyalty and prudence is undiluted. And so I don't know where this presumption comes from. It's not in the statute itself.   But it is -- it is a purpose, Mr. Long, isn't it? You said -- you guoted the statute, and the statute just says benefits. But isn't the plan -- doesn't the plan itself mention retirement?
12-7515 +++$+++       How would you respond to the hypothetical that the government poses on 24 of its brief, that it's the three drops of poison, each defendant puts in one drop, one drop will not do it, three drops will, and none of them would be chargeable because it takes three drops?      Three -- three drops.      You do agree that, that an overdose -- there is a foreseeable risk that someone who purchases heroin will overdose, there is a foreseeable risk of that?      Well, one was -- the heroin was illegal -- was not -- the selling of a sleeping pill is not illegal.    It's perfectly lawful. Selling heroin is illegal.    Doesn't that make a difference?      May I just clarify before you're finished.    You have used the words "foreseeability," "but for."    Are you saying, to make it very simple, that unless the government proves that the heroin independently would cause death, then no conviction?    The heroin must independently cause the death.    Is that -      Well, are you then saying except for the heroin ingestion, the death would not have occurred?
12-761 +++$+++    What would be the components of the injunctive relief that you would seek? Assuming you have a Lanham Act claim, what should Coke have done to make its product non-misleading?   Without saying what label would be lawful?
12-7822 +++$+++       Mr. Fisher, and you can stick with this case.    Once he's arrested on a robbery charge, he can be held for many, many days.    Why isn't it appropriate to assume, not when he's asked to come out and talk to the police for two minutes, but when he's incarcerated on a robbery charge, that the premises are no longer open to him, that he's no longer at home there?      Well, in the -- in the interim.    He's been charged, not convicted, and he's - he's in jail awaiting trial.      Was there any indication why the police didn't get a warrant in that hour interval?
12-786 +++$+++    Mr. Panner, is this -- is this a problem that's special to business method patents as opposed to, say, product?   But the parties briefed -- this case tends to be rather confusing because didn't the parties brief, what is it, 271(1) or -- and then the Federal Circuit decided it on sub (2) .   Ms. Anders, will you clarify if the government, which has now told us what its position is on sub (b) also has a position on sub (a), which is what the Federal Circuit originally decided this case under?
12-79 +++$+++        Mr. -- Mr. Clement, there are -- Zandford said that "in connection with" doesn't include ever common law fraud that happens to involve covered securities.     So can you give us an example of what would not be covered?     What fraud involving securities would not qualify as in connection with the sale or purchase of securities?       Even if you're right about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a representation that this is insured by Lloyds, and there was another claim that they made.     So even -- even if you are right, wouldn't the answer be, okay, drop anything that has to do with "in connection with the sale or purchase of securities." We have -- oh, we have a claim about the insurance, and we also have a claim that both Antigua and United States were heavily regulated.     Those were false. Why couldn't they have a complaint shorn of the incorrect premise and based on the insurance and the regulated aspects?
12-794 +++$+++    Is your position, basically, that this is in the nature of a -- an affirmative defense and that defendant carries the burden on remorse -- and what was the other one that Mitchell saved out? Acceptance of responsibility?   So if defendant says nothing, then he hasn't -- he hasn't proved a mitigator.   I thought we -- it wasn't controversial that, on mitigating factors, the defendant does have the burden.   So is -- is there a difference between the prosecutor saying, judge, I want you to charge this jury that they can use defendant's silence against him, or a judge, on his own, telling the jury that, or the judge, as here, simply refusing to say you can't take it into account?   Are all those the same, or would you distinguish them?
12-815 +++$+++       Mr. Simeone, this -- the background of this case, I don't quite grasp.    You originally said that you wanted to make sure you -- there was no disconnection pending the FCC's resolution of the issue.      Has the FCC had a proceeding to resolve it?      Well, why wouldn't - let's say you -- you -- there were no abstention.    You have your case in Federal court.    And the Federal judge says, the FCC hasn't spoken, so I don't want to step out in front of the FCC on this on this -- on this question.      Well, you could.    You could challenge it in the State court or this Court and -- eventually.    But there's a proceeding going on in the State court, and there's a review -- State review attached to that.    And you're -- you're saying we can cut off this administrative process that ends in State review.    We could cut it off and go to the Federal court.      You explained that. But -- but in the review -- in your review petition from the State court -- to the State court, you brought up more than just this -- the question of these -- these charges.      What do you say about the argument that -- that once the IUB decided to go on with this proceeding, you didn't want them to, but they did, that that then became a proceeding for them to enforce the access charge?
12-820 +++$+++    Mr. -- Mr. Regan, you -- you want us to apply eguitable tolling in a field, family law, where the interest of the child is always of paramount importance and running all through family law is -- is that concern. And changed circumstances figure very large. So decrees that might be final in another area of law are not because, if circumstances change, then the child custody may change. So it seems to me that this area is hugely unfit for eguitable tolling that would leave out consideration of the child's best interests.   Where is Article 13, so we can look at it?   Well, Mr. Regan, aside from the position of the United States, which -- which has changed, you made that point, the determination that's being made at this stage is really one of venue. It's where the main bout will be fought out. And so we don't want that to linger for a long time. We want that decision to be made with dispatch. And as one of the amici brief informs us, many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be badly abused women and if you -- if they had to go under Article 13, then they would have this full-blown, was he really the abuser? Doing it without equitable tolling, that question is reserved for the main -- for the main bout. I suppose if we had a case where the judge isn't certain was the father abuser or not, that judge would feel an obligation to stretch out this venue determination, to see if it's an Article 13 situation.
12-842 +++$+++    That's on what you can execute. FSIA itself doesn't say anything about discovery. Is that right?   You're saying that you can't inguire into property that would be exempt anywhere. That's the difference. You may have to bring a separate suit in Florida or probably if it's a Federal judgment you just register it there. But in the typical case, the judgment debtor is exposed, all of her assets are exposed. Here I think what you're saying is the statute, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, confines what can be executed. Whether Florida, France, anyplace, it's got to be property -- commercial property in the United States. Is that --   In saying that, are you giving up the argument you started to make before Justice Breyer gave you four ways? You pointed out that Rule 69, the discovery rule, says that -- that these rules are subject -- "Statutes of the United States" -- the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is one -- "Statutes of the United States, when applicable -- applicable, govern under this rule," and then there's a slew of examples of statutes that limit what you can attach, what you can execute on. I thought that that's -- that -- if that's right, then your answer now, well, as long it's the same kind of property in France, the answer would be the only thing you can discover relates to property in the United States.
12-8561 +++$+++    Why do we  why would we   Why -- why should we get to that question, when we have what seems to be a clear order from Congress, and it is in 2259 (a) . It says, "The court shall -- shall order restitution for any offense under this chapter." It sounds like that's a direction that, if there's an offense under this chapter -- which is undisputed, there is -- the court shall order restitution.   Well, it doesn't --   Let me ask you. You're mentioning this case. There was another case that also involved and came up at the same time, the Wright case, and there was a settlement there, and it was for -- what was the amount of money? The amount of damages in the Wright case?   Now, but was there something in the evidence there that made it proper to award restitution in the Wright case, but not in this case?   They're the same?
12-872 +++$+++        Mr. Scodro, there's a preliminary question before we get to the question you presented, and that is, what authority did the Seventh Circuit have to deal with the question under the Age Discrimination Act?     I mean, it was -- it went to the Seventh Circuit on interlocutory review -       -- a qualified immunity question.     Everybody agrees that there is no qualified immunity, that there -- that there is, indeed, a claim that the Equal Protection Clause includes age.     So Second -- Seventh Circuit had no authority to deal with any question other than that, did it?       But in Wilkie, the whole case was dismissed by the district court, wasn't it?     So whatever was said in that footnote was dicta.       You're running up against the Seventh Circuit in that respect because the Seventh Circuit held that the existence of -- of an -- whether ADEA was the exclusive remedy, that that was irrelevant to the qualified immunity issue.       The decision was that there was no qualified immunity.     And the question is, having determined there was no qualified immunity, should they have stopped there?     There wouldn't have been a trial -- if there is no qualified immunity, then they have no exemption from trial.       There's another preliminary question, and that is, why are we talking about the ADEA, when the district court held that the ADEA doesn't cover Mr. Levin?     And there seems to be not much of a dispute about that.     You're not arguing that the ADEA does cover him, are you?       But why -- if the ADEA is expanding the Civil Rights protection against age discrimination much more generous to the employee, isn't it strange to think that Congress, at the same time, wanted employees to have these expanded rights and to do away with the preexisting remedies?
12-873 +++$+++    Well, then you could you could sue them for infringing on your patent or whatever intellectual property protection you have. But here is an entrepreneur that says, we make a product, and Lexmark is disparaging our product. It is essentially trying to get us out of this line of business. Certainly, if you just read the words of the Lanham Act, this is allegedly false advertising, and the false advertiser shall be liable to any person who believes he or she is likely to be damaged by such an act. That -- that legislation seems to envision a very broad standing, certainly enough to encompass the person who is -- whose product is being disparaged.   Explain to me why -- we are talking in abstract terms. Here is a manufacturer that says, my product is being disparaged by the defendant -- my product, not someone else's -- the result is that I am losing business. Why do we need anything more than that under the Lanham Act, which makes false advertising -- gives a claim for false advertising to somebody who's been hurt by it?   But I'm not asking about State law remedies. I'm looking at this statute, and your interpretation seems to stray very far from what the statute -- this section of the statute says.   And if you just read this section, would you agree that -- what is the party -- SCC is someone who has been injured, damaged, by the false advertising?   Is there any guestion here that there was an intent on the part of Lexmark to stop the Static Control company from making these microchips?   Yes. That's what we have -- and we have to deal with the complaint and have to assume that that's true. What the complaint alleges is that Static was making a product and Lexmark was disparaging it and not by happenstance, but guite deliberately.   And the -- the directive -- the letter said don't buy Static Control's product because, if you do, you're in jeopardy of being a contributory infringer.   I'm sorry. You used "target" twice. Once, you said SCC was not a target, and the other time, you said it was, but it -- target isn't a test.   Explain that. Because, if we accept the allegation of the complaint as true, the allegation is that Static's product was disparaged, that remanufacturers were told, don't use this product because, if you do, you're going to be involved in infringement.   Well, was Title VII an APA -- when I asked Mr. Jones?
12-895 +++$+++       Mr. Elwood, you're dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals.    But in this case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the person -- he was convicted of carrying ammunition, right?    There were two counts of carrying -- possession of the ammunition.    And couldn't one infer from that that he -- he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun carrier?      What was the evidence that the jury had on whether he possessed the ammunition?      Does that -- does that have to do with the additional 120 months?    The underlying crime is 48 months and then the -- the gun makes it 120 months more consecutive?
12-9012 +++$+++    When you said fully returned, it wouldn't be fully returned if the debt was greater than the value of the property.   What would happen if it turned out that the property was worth more on the date of sentencing than it was on the date of foreclosure?   Well, how do you arrive at the foreclosure amount? I mean, the one virtue or a virtue of the Government's approach is you get the money, and you know exactly how much the house sold for. How do you -- at the time of foreclosure, there's been no sale. How do you determine the value? You said in Wisconsin, there are often appraisals, but there wasn't any in this case, was there?   And who's -- who has the burden of proof? If we -- we know the proceeds when it's sold. It's not sold. But you say it has to be valued as of the time of foreclosure. And I think you said someplace in your brief that it's the Government's burden to show the value at the time of foreclosure.   Well, the Government's interest, I think, would be to show a low value, right?   You made a point about under Wisconsin law, there would be -- and the foreclosure -- suppose there were a foreclosure, there could be no deficiency judgment. Were you trying to suggest from that that you get the property and -- and no restitution for the rest?   There was no -- there was no --   -- evidence of that in this case, that the bank held on too long.   The answer that Ms. Harrington gave was that there were no bids.   I think she said there were no bids.
12-929 +++$+++        That's only -- what that tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing. You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have to. My problem with your interpretation is you are allowing a private agreement to make a venue prescription that Congress enacted improper.     Congress said it was proper.     It may be that it should not apply in this case because the parties have consented to something else, but it's not a wrong venue. I mean, suppose the question had never come up.     The -- there wasn't a claim that this was a wrong venue.     The -- the case could have proceeded, and it would have been a place of proper venue, right?       But it doesn't become - it's a place of proper venue.     There may be a reason why another venue is the one that should control in this case, but you can't make a private agreement -- can't say what Congress says is proper is improper.       That doesn't mean it's improper.     It means it's waiverable.       Because consent is a basis for personal jurisdiction.       Isn't that -- that's a problem with the argument.     Both 1404(a) and 1406 provide for transfer.     This Court has emphasized that it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system, the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just transfer to the appropriate forum.     And that's what Professor Sachs' view leaves out because the result, as you say, is -- it's only dismissal, no transfer.       Where -- it's -- 1404(a) and 1406 deal with venue.     They don't deal with personal jurisdiction.       That's if it's -- if it's a State forum or foreign forum, but 1404(a) is a codification of the forum non conveniens doctrine?       I don't follow that.     If it's an affirmative defense, you have to raise it or you lose it.     You can't hold back an affirmative defense, and, in the middle of the trial, say, Oh, there's an affirmative defense here.     (8)(c) requires you to state it.       That would be taken care of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply when a party is acting in violation of a contractual provision.     Van Dusen against Barrack was intended to give the plaintiff plaintiff's choice of initial forum. If plaintiff chooses a forum in violation of the contract, there's no reason why Van Dusen should apply.
12-930 +++$+++    But isn't there -- isn't the effect on the no longer child much more severe? I mean, if everybody has to get bumped down a little way, it'll make a difference of months until they qualify for a hearing.   Well, it's not going to be 27 years.   It's not going to be 20 years.   What about all the time this one child has been waiting? It gets no credit for that?
12-9490 +++$+++    I thought that -- that J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is somebody is carrying a bomb?
12-96 +++$+++        And Congress -- Congress said that, too.     Nobody -- there isn't anybody in -- on any side of this issue who doesn't admit that huge progress has been made.     Congress itself said that.     But in line with Justice Sotomayor's question, in the D.C. Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge there, Judge Williams, said, "If this case were about three States, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, those States have the worst records, and application of Section 5 to them might be okay."       You keep -- you keep --       Mr. Rein, you keep emphasizing over and over again in your brief, registration and you said it a couple of times this morning.     Congress was well aware that registration was no longer the problem.     This legislative record is replete with what they call second generation devices. Congress said up front:     We know that the registration is fine.     That is no longer the problem.     But the discrimination continues in other forms.       Mr. Rein, I just remind because it's something we said about equal footing, in Katzenbach the Court said, "The doctrine of the equality of the States invoked by South Carolina does not bar this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the terms upon which States are admitted to the Union and not to the remedies for local evils which have subsequently appeared."     That's what -- has the Court changed that interpretation?
12-98 +++$+++        You answered the question with respect to jury verdicts.     I suppose it would be no different if it 's the judge that found the 10 percent rather than the jury.       The question that Justice Breyer was asking about the 10 percent has already been answered because we were told that if a jury allocated 10 percent to medicals, it would not make any difference, the statute entitles the State to 30 percent.       I thought -- I thought your brief said that at some point, if it gets too high, you do have a problem under the anti-lien provision of Medicaid?
12-99 +++$+++       Mr. MCCracken, could you -- could you tell -- tell us about this particular contract, because as far as I can fathom from what we have it expired at least a year ago and there was - there was no recognition, there was no election; is that right?      So, are we dealing with a live case considering that the -- the agreement has expired?      So what would be -- what would be the relief?      Because -- is it on the theory that it did it once, so it might do it again?    Is that -      But not in this -- not in this case.    It wasn't raised in this case.      And Sinclair is of a certain age before this Court looked more carefully at the implication of private rights of action.      Does the United States have a position on the implication of a private right of action under 302?      One curious thing about the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is it didn't reject. It's a -- it's a curious opinion and we are at an interlocutory stage.    But the opinion reads:    "Employers and unions may set ground rules for an organizing campaign even if the employer and union benefit from the agreement."    So that the Eleventh Circuit seemed to agree that these agreements are enforceable.    But it said that it can -- they can become illegal if used in a scheme to corrupt.
12-992 +++$+++    As I understand it, the -- the First Circuit position is not what's being defended; instead, it's the Eleventh Circuit's position, which is a bright-line.   I thought it was that, if it's statutory, Budinich controls; if it's contractual, then you -- you treat it as though it's a question of damages.
13-115 +++$+++    Mr. Gershengorn, suppose it's originally set up by the police, the motorcade is coming down, each side has roughly equal access. Then the Secret Service comes along and said: Clear the anti-Bush demonstrators. Suppose that, that -- those were the facts. Would there be a valid Bivens claim?   The rationale is just it's more likely that the people who are against the President would be harmful to him than the people who are for him.
13-132 +++$+++    So how -- how would it work with a magistrate? You recognize -- you just told Justice Kennedy -- that a warrant could be obtained. A warrant for what? What would the police have to show? And let's take your very case. So they -- they have seized, which is proper, seized the phone, they've secured it, and now they want to search it. So they apply for a warrant. And what would the warrant have to say?
13-193 +++$+++    Are you making that argument on behalf of the other organization? Susan B. Anthony List, you have accurately described what occurred. But the other organization has never been charged before the Ohio Election Commission. Is there any reason to believe anybody's going to lodge a complaint against it?   I thought that the Court in Younger said with respect to those other three, that they had never been threatened with prosecution. I don't recall it made a distinction on the basis of what they wanted to talk about.   But the one guestion is who is the "they"? Now, it might be that Susan B. Anthony List is considered a group with real clout. So a candidate might be really concerned about Susan B. Anthony's speech. But the other organization maybe is not as well funded and the candidate says, well, a lot of things are said in political campaigns. I'll let this one go. This one doesn't hurt me as much.   There is a provision for an advisory opinion, unless the guestion is if you are arguing strenuously that this statute violates the Constitution. You could have asked the Commission for an advisory opinion saying that the statute can't be enforced, but you didn't do that.   Why did -- why did you say it would be found capable -- not capable of repetition? It seems to me that you were guite right to say before that this is most capable of repetition.   Do you think this is a matter of standing or ripeness? The Sixth Circuit said ripeness.   Are you arguing that the other organization, COAST, also has standing? Because you -- you seem to reguire for the credible threat for there to have been a proceeding before the Commission and there's been nothing with regard to the other organization.   So how do you distinguish the three in Younger v. Harris that the Court said didn't have standing?
13-298 +++$+++    Mr. Phillips, on the abstract idea, you know that the Bilski case held that hedging qualified as an abstract idea. So how is intermediate settlement a less abstract than hedging?   There is no special software that comes with this -- that's part of this patent, is it -- is there?   Mr. Phillips, let me just stop you there, because four Justices of this Court did not read that legislative history the way you do. And it was -- was in Bilski.   Justice Stevens went carefully through that and he said: Congress was IS reacting to a decision. It had -- it was not addressing 101. So there are at least four Justices who say -- who didn't buy that argument.   Mr. Phillips, in response ~   In Bilski, Justice Breyer did try to say that there wasn't that -- a whole lot of distance between the four who thought business methods were not patentable. But he -- he also said something else in -- in the other case, Mayo. Justice Scalia asked you the question about doesn't that go to novelty, but didn't Justice Breyer say in Mayo that novelty can be relevant to patent -- to patent eligibility? He said there's -- there's an overlap.
13-299 +++$+++    But, Mr. Shanmugam, it could have meaning if it were read to refer to the debtor's retirement fund, not anyone's retirement fund. And let me ask you one disturbing feature of this. Congress was very careful when it crafted exemptions from the bankrupt estate, like the homestead exemption. It said what, 22 -- something over $22,000, the car, 37-something. Is it likely that Congress would have created an exemption so large that -- this one is claimed to be $300,000 -- for funds that are immediately usable by the bankrupt? I mean, this big pot of money gets exempt from -- from the creditors' claim, it just seems incongruous considering how narrow Congress has made the other exemptions.   Wasn't the purpose of that, however, to see that the beneficiary wasn't going to be hit with a huge tax liability if it had to take the whole thing all at once?   But in this very case, I mean, this was a fund of what, $400,000-odd. The daughter, the beneficiary, had already spent 150,000 of that.   So for your purposes, you wouldn't need -- I mean, you would be -- you would have a, I think, an airtight case if the statute didn't use the word "retirement funds," it just exempted funds in -- in an account that is exempt from taxation, period?   But it would just be defining "retirement funds" to mean the debtor's retirement funds.   Could you explain in that context? You said something about uniformity. Seven states isn't a particularly high percentage of the States. Does the -- does the debtor's home State -- has the debtor's home State adopted this exemption?   So would the other interpretation that says it has to be the debtor's retirement account.
13-301 +++$+++    Could you -- could you apply your rule, district court discretion in this particular case? There were two allegations, I think, that -- the first one was that the -- this was in retaliation for the taxpayers' refusal for the third time to extend the limitation period. And the other was this was an effort to circumvent the limited discovery that's allowed in the tax court. Now, those were the allegations. What would the taxpayer have to say in addition to those two allegations to pass your test?   But the problem is, you say the district court could say, yes, I'm going to -- I'm going to require this agent to testify or no, I'm not going to. You're using a discretion test, but you're not giving the district judges all over the country a clue about appropriate exercise of that question. And if I understand your most recent answer, you're saying it could go either way, it's up to the district judge.   But there was a time when the government thought that was the right procedure. The Salter case has been mentioned and there the government itself made the suggestion that if there's an allegation, an allegation of improper purpose, the court should have a hearing at which the taxpayer gets an opportunity to question the agent.
13-316 +++$+++    But it fits - it fits the words Congress used, "obtained funds owned or controlled by financial -- a financial institution by means of false representation."   Two of the -- two of the six checks involved were paid by the drawing bank. Isn't that so?   It doesn't have the two subparts. But here you are essentially asking us to read the word "or," "(1) or (2)" to mean (1) including (2) .   But it's not identical because in the bank fraud statute, Congress broke out and separately numbered (1) and (2) and they didn't do that in the mail fraud.   Mr. Yang said it wasn't -- wasn't -- the scope of 513 wasn't clear.
13-317 +++$+++    I believe that in Basic, Justice Blackmun said that there is this economic theory, but also the motivation for the Exchange Act and probability and common sense would lead to this presumption -- this rebuttable presumption. So he wasn't relying strictly on an economic theory. I think two or three times in the opinion, he tries to make that plain.   Where is that, that it says that 18 (a) is the proper --   -- reference?   Isn't the -- isn't the -- it's not a guestion of is it rebuttable. I thought that that's already claimed from Basic. It's a guestion of when. You're arguing that it should be rebuttable at the class certification stage. The other side is arguing, yeah, of course it's rebuttable, but that comes in at the merits determination. It doesn't go to the question whether there are individual issues that predominate over class issues.   Then how is such a plaintiff's claim typical of the class? You have -- you admitted that the 23 (a) factors are met, commonality and typicality. Well, if one is a member of this class that says, we didn't rely individually, but we did rely on the marketplace as being -- as having integrity, if you have someone to whom a direct representation was made, that person is not a proper member of this class as a discrete question, not one common to the class, not one typical. The typical investor in a Basic class is somebody who no representation was made to that person directly.   How many of those drop out at the summary judgment stage?   Whatever it might have been at the beginning, given the most recent legislation, Congress took a look at the 10 (b) (5) action and it made a lot of changes. It made pleading requirements. It's difficult to say that this -- Congress would have legislated all these constraints if it thought there was no action to begin with.
13-339 +++$+++    How many  how many States have -- this is -- this is a general statute of repose and nothing to do in particular with CERCLA; is that right?   And how many States have such statutes?   But if you were to prevail, then the parties concerned might well go to their State legislatures and say, enact a statute of repose. That will get us off the hook, even before the injured person is aware of the injury and of the cause of it. The result of that would be to totally defeat what Congress meant to do in saying the trigger is when you know the cause of the injury.   What would be the constitutional problem if Congress had said all people claiming an injury under this statute can commence the action three years after discovery of the cause, to say that?   What kind of -- I don't follow that. A statute of repose is a time limitation; is that right?   I thought that what Congress was trying to do was to establish a Federally required commencement date, a Federal requirement -- a Federally requirement commencement date. So when you ask the question, how much time do I have to sue for one of these CERCLA injuries, the answer would be three years after you know the cause of your injury. Now, on your -- taking out this statute of repose, there can no longer be a uniform answer to that question.   So, Mr. Palmore, if  if Congress -- if all of the States enact this 10 -- 10-year statute of repose, then that has totally undermined what Congress set about to do in 9658.   But, Mr. Palmore, the question I asked is suppose all of the States have these 10-year statutes of repose. Then there would be no occasion to invoke 9658, and the plaintiff would be out of court before the action accrued in some cases.   Does -- does the restatement court statute of repose, are they going back to what -- at least I learned in law school, there was a statute of limitations and then there was a so-called built-in statute of limitations. Statute of limitations general covered all claims, but a built-in statute of limitations was considered to limit not simply the remedy, but the right.
13-354 +++$+++    Mr. Clement, maybe it seemed clear then, but since RFRA, just as before RFRA, Congress has continued to write into Federal legislation specific religious exemptions for some, but not everybody, for individuals, sometimes religious institutions. So if it was all that clear that RFRA took care of it all, why did Congress continue after RFRA to pass these laws focusing the exemption on an individual, religious institution? Those, as I take your argument, all of those laws -- and there are more than half a dozen -- were unnecessary. Once RFRA was on the books, Congress didn't have to do that any more.   Mr. Clement, this -- this was a law that was passed overwhelmingly, both houses of Congress. People from all sides of the political spectrum voted for it. It seems strange that there would have been that tremendous uniformity if it means what you said it means, to take -- to cover profit corporations, especially in light of -- there was an effort to adopt a conscience amendment, a specific conscience amendment in 2012, and the Senate rejected that. That -- that amendment would have enabled secular employers and insurance providers to deny coverage on the basis of religious beliefs or moral convictions. It was specifically geared to secular employers and insurance providers. And that -- that was rejected.   Well, It was a religious organization.   This is -- this is what's different. I mean, all along the earlier cases dealt with individuals and they dealt with religious institutions.   There was a point made earlier, and I think you didn't mean to say this, that provision of health care is not part of their religious belief. Covering their employees for health care, that is not a religious tenet, right?   But, Mr. Clement, you made the analogy to RLUIPA. And the one thing that has not been mentioned up till now is the Establishment Clause. The Court was very clear when it came to RLUIPA, which you said is similar to RFRA, that the accommodation must be measured so it doesn't override other significant interests. And that was true of Sherbert and that was true of Yoder. The -- and the Cutter case, and this Court made it very clear, that the accommodation has to be balanced and you have to take into account other significant interests.   It would make no difference if it were -- there are 20 FDA-approved contraceptives, all of them covered by the Healthcare Act.   You  you picked out, in one case what, three, and the other case four? Suppose the employer says contraceptives all together are against my religion, so I'm not going to give any contraceptive coverage.   But your argument, it seems to me, would apply just as well if the employer said no contraceptives.
13-369 +++$+++    Why is this claim ambiguous? It's evident that these electrodes have to be close enough so that the user's hand contacts both electrodes, but separate enough to heap -- keep electrodes distinct. Why isn't that sufficiently definite?   The Court has to come up with a formula. You were saying the Federal Circuit's formula is no good. The Solicitor General has, as the Chief Justice just said, has suggested an appropriate formula. And you say, well, it depends on the application. As a formula, do you agree?   Well, what is -- what is the ambiguity? Is it -- I thought from your brief that it was the term "space relationship." Is that the -- what -- what is the ambiguity?   The government tells us there are some 22,000 patent grants since 1976 that use the term "spaced relationship." I suppose many of those would fail your test?   But the Federal Circuit said something -- I'm looking at the petition appendix at 20 (a) -- that sounded very close to what the government standard is. It said, "Sufficiently" -- "that the claim provides parameters sufficient for a skilled artisan to understand the bounds of spaced relationship." That sounds very close to what the government says and it isn't -- they don't say anything about insoluble in -- in that statement.
13-461 +++$+++    Mr. Stewart, before you finish, Mr. Clement in his brief made the point that we would -- if we took the position that Petitioner urges, there would be an incompatibility with our international obligations; that is, Aereo's view of the public performance right is incompatible with our obligations under the Berne Convention and under -- what is it, WYCO? On pages 44 to 45 of his brief, he says that "Aereo's view of what the public performance right is runs straight up against our international obligations," and he cites a case from the European Court of Justice and I think another case.
13-483 +++$+++    Is there any -- would there be any Pickering balancing in this case?   If the Court says that speech is protected, would there be any need to go on these facts into a Pickering balance?   But we are asked to decide the gualified immunity and how can we find there is no gualified immunity in view of the Morris v. Crow decision?
132, Orig. +++$+++            Mr. Phillips, the point that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing away the taxpayers' money to no purpose.             That is, what is the point of continuing to pursue a license when North Carolina does not have the funding to continue the process and to open the disposal facility? So North Carolina's point of view is:           What does it mean to continue to seek the license when they are not going to have the money to get to the end of the line?          But the --           So your argument is then that they acted 2 years too late.             When they gave notice that they were not able to go forward, but they were going to keep this thing going, so if the funds should somehow become available, they would have the -- they would have things still in place. They wouldn't have terminated the effort.           So if they had done everything the same --           But they told you what -   it was totally up-front.          They said:    Look, we can't go forward with this.           We haven't got the money.   We ll let everything sit, to see if someone will come up with the money. That's -- it's -- you paint a picture of repudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave notice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't get the money.          What were the benefits that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going for another 2 years?            At what point did South Carolina withdraw?           And so they -- by 1997, they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore.          But in -- but in the --          -- case of this compact and the other ones, as I -- do I understand correctly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none of these compacts that were negotiated around the same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an operative disposal facility?           But they also -- you said -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997, the Commission came forward with some kind of additional funding proposal, which North Carolina came down -- turned down.           What -- what was that?          Why did -- why did North Carolina turn it down?          But you say there was a package, that there was a -- an offer in place where the Commission would pay X and the generators would kick in an additional amount as well.          And that was -- that -- everybody had signed -- everybody who was part of that offer had signed onto it?
134 ORIG +++$+++                Mr. Farr, one of the striking things about this Compact is that to the extent that it is definite, there is a lot in here in detail about service arrests on the river and about fishing, but then you get to these two articles at the end and they certainly don't have that same definite detailed quality.    As I read the Article VII that you're stressing, it says -- let's see -- "may continue to exercise."   So it seems to me that "may continue to" was just whatever was the status quo, that will continue; not to do anything dispositive, just whatever was will continue.              Mr. Farr, what about the article that follows Article VII?                 Article VIII says: "Nothing herein contained shall affect the territorial limits, rights, or jurisdiction of either State in or over the Delaware River."           So that's a qualification at least on every other article.              Yes, and I don't see anything expressly set forth in VII, which just says "may continue to," which says the status quo is maintained.              That suggests --              -- it's still an extraordinary power for one State to give up.               If Delaware -- if that land -- they didn't settle the boundary, but it might be on the Delaware side.               If Delaware was giving up so much, what did it get in exchange?               No, I'm not assuming that.   I'm assuming it's unknown, but there is the possibility that it's going to end up --               -- end up --               There's a possibility that it will end up on the Delaware side.               And you're suggesting that Delaware relinquished all of its regulatory authority and gave it to New Jersey, no matter where the boundary turned out to be.                And there was in fact in this project, was there not, there was required dredging of 1.24 million cubic yards of submerged soil that would be --                -- on the Delaware side of the boundary?                I thought this extended out more than any prior exercise of riparian rights.                Yes.          This was going to be 2,000 feet, and the greatest extension up until then was between 500 and 600.
137, Orig. +++$+++        General Bullock, would you please point to the precise language of the compact that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the amount of water diverted -- which freezes consumption as of January 1st, 1950?       Well, the uses existing is irrigation. I don't see where it says -- and so I can understand, the amount of water diverted can't be increased.       But would -       And what happens under Montana law?       General Bullock, assume that you're right, that what was guaranteed was the same amount of water flowing into Montana as in 1950, and I -- I take it you don't care how Wyoming deals with this, but what -- if you're right, what could Wyoming do?     It can't tell the -- the farmers go back to the old way of irrigating or go back to a different crop?       So, you say it doesn't - they don't -- Wyoming doesn't have to know whether farmer A or farmer B is taking more than they took in -- I mean, is using more than they used in 1950; they just have to know what the total amount is, and Wyoming can make that up?
138, Orig. +++$+++              Mr. Frederick, if this were an ordinary civil case, we would be guided by the rule on permissive intervention, and appellate courts in dealing with that rule give a healthy measure of respect to the trial judge's determination. So even though the civil rules are not binding in original jurisdiction cases, isn't that a sound approach that we should adopt?             Just as a court of appeals would defer to a district judge's decision, so we should give a healthy measure of deference to the Special Master's evaluation that this will be useful.            Mr. Frederick, can we go back a little?   I think you just said there was no special master's recommendation in Maryland v. Louisiana, but I'm looking at page 745.            In the footnote 21, it said:       "The master recommended that we grant the motion of 17 pipeline companies to intervene as plaintiffs."        And then it says:       "It is not unusual to permit intervention of private parties in original actions."            Well, here the complaint was South Carolina's complaint, and these are intervenors on North Carolina's -- on North Carolina's side.            And as representing the position of the United States, would you address the FERC license that Duke Energy is raising?
11-398 +++$+++        Mr. Long, why don't we simply follow the statutory language?     I know that you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act is "no suit shall be maintained."     It's remarkably similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed Elsevier:     "No civil action for infringement ... shall be instituted."     And that formulation, "no suit may be maintained," contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act.     It says the district court shall not enjoin.     That Tax Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says "courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding in State court."     So, both of those formulas, the TIA and the no injunction against proceedings at State court, are directed to "court."     The Anti-Injunction Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says "no suit shall be maintained."     And it has been argued that that is suitor-directed in contrast to court-directed.       But how is that different from "no civil action for infringement shall be instituted" -- "maintained" and "instituted"?     Anything turn on that?       Mr. Long --       Mr. Long, you said before -- and I think you were quite right -- that the Tax Injunction Act is modeled on the Anti-Injunction Act.     And, under the Tax Injunction Act, what -- what can't be enjoined is an assessment for the purpose of raising revenue.     The Tax Injunction Act does not apply to penalties that are designed to induce compliance with the law, rather than to raise revenue.     And this is not a revenue-raising measure because, if it's successful, they -- nobody will pay the penalty, and there will be no revenue to raise.       Mr. Long, there's another argument that has been made that I would like you to address, and that is all this talk about tax penalty -- it's all beside the point because this suit is not challenging the penalty.     This is a suit that is challenging the must-buy provision, and the argument is made that, if, indeed, "must-buy" is constitutional, then these complainants will not resist the penalty. So, what they're seeking is a determination that the "must-buy" requirement, stated separately from the penalty, that the "must-buy" is unconstitutional. And, if that's so, that's the end of the case; if it's not so, they're not resisting the penalty.       If that's -- if that's the problem, it's easy to amend a complaint.     They can just take that out of the complaint.     So, it can't turn on that.       Mr. Verrilli, a basic question about your argument:     If you're right about the second part, that is, for purposes of the statute, the Anti-Injunction statute, this penalty does not constitute a tax, then does the Court need to decide whether the Anti-Injunction Act in other cases, where it does involve a tax, is jurisdictional?       But the question that I asked you is, if you're right that this penalty is not covered by section 7421, if you're right about that, why should we deal with the jurisdictional question at all? Because this statute, correct, the way you're reading -- read it doesn't involve a tax that's subject to the Anti-Injunction Act.       So -- so, you agree that we would not -- if we agree with you about the correct interpretation of the statute, we need not decide the jurisdiction.       How likely is it --       How likely is it -- I mean, the government is going to be defending these suits.     How likely is it that the government will overlook the Anti-Injunction Act?     So, it seems to me that this is arming the government by saying it's waivable at the government's option.       Why isn't Reed Elsevier -- if you're dividing jurisdiction from claims processing -- it says you have to register before you can sue.     There are a lot of things you have to do before you can sue.     So, why isn't Reed Elsevier like you have to pay a filing fee before you can file a complaint?       On your statutory construction argument, is there any other exaction imposed under the Internal Revenue Code that would not qualify as a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, or is 5000A just out there all by itself?
11-400 +++$+++        Isn't that true of every Medicaid increase, that each time -- I mean, and this started quite many years ago, and Congress has added more people and given more benefits -- and every time, the condition is, if you want the Medicaid program, this is the program.     Take it or leave it.       Mr. Clement, may I -- may I ask you -- question another line? You represent, what, 26 States?       And we're also told that there are other States that like this expansion, and they are very glad to have it. The relief that you're seeking is to say the whole expansion is no good, never mind that there are States that say we don't feel coerced, we think this is good. You are -- you're saying that because you represent a sizeable number of States, you can destroy this whole program, even though there may be as many States that want it, that don't feel coerced, that say -- think this is a good thing?       Let -- let me ask you another thing, Mr. -- Mr. Clement.     Most colleges and universities are heavily dependent on the government to fund their research programs and other things, and that's been going on for a long time.     And then Title IX passes, and a government official comes around and say -- says to these colleges, if you want money for your physics labs and all the other things you get it for, then you have to create an athletic program for girls.     And the recipient says I am being coerced, there's no way in the world I can give up all the funds to run all these labs that we have.     I can't give it up, so I'm being coerced to accept this program that I don't want. Why doesn't your theory -- if your theory is any good, why doesn't it work anytime something -- someone receives something that's too good to give up?       Where on your -- I'm trying to understand your coercion theory.     I know that there are cases of ours that have said there's a line between pressure and coercion, but we have never had, in the history of this country or the Court, any Federal program struck down because it was so good that it becomes coercive to be in it.       Let's take -- let's take public colleges.      Mr. Clement, may I ask one question about your bottom line in this case?     It sounds to me like everything you said would be to the effect of, if Congress continued to do things on a voluntary basis, so with adding these new eligibles, and say, States, you can have it or not, you can preserve the program as it existed before, you can opt into this. But you're not asking the Court as relief to say, well, that's how we -- that's how we cure the constitutional infirmity; we say this has to be on a voluntary basis.     Instead, you are arguing that this whole Medicaid -- the addition, that the whole expansion has to be nullified and, moreover, the entire Health Care Act.    Instead of having the easy repair, you say that if we accept your position, everything falls.
12-1226 +++$+++    Mr. Bagenstos, what would your case be if -- let's accept, for argument's sake, that there's a category people who are injured off duty who do not get light work assignments. So you -- you pointed to three large categories that do, but let's suppose one category doesn't.   That wasn't the position that the government took in the U.S. Postal Service policy. We are told that the government defended a policy that is, for all intents and purposes, the same as United Parcel Service. And more than that, some briefs called Petitioner's position frivolous, contrived. That was the government's position. So will you explain how the government -- I suppose to this day, because the Postal Service still retains, as far as we know, the exclusion of pregnant women.
12-1497 +++$+++    And that goes for the government as -- I mean, suppose the government, not a relator, brings a False Claims case against a contractor. The government wouldn't get the -- the -- under your view, the government doesn't get the suspension?   The relator is treated as the government for preclusion purposes.   And that was at least, at least sole judge after verdict.   Well, there is -- there is good authority, at least in the court of appeals, for that position.   The guestion is whether somebody else could come in. So you have somebody who is the first filer and comes in with a sloppy complaint and it's not stated with sufficient specificity; dismissed. And that person goes way. You're saying nobody else can ever come in.   I thought that first file rule was meant to protect the first filer in that -- well, one aspect of it is the first filer doesn't have to worry about a race to judgment. Somebody else files second and gets the judgment first. So I thought that that was -- one of the chief things was to protect the first filer and also to protect that filer's recovery so he doesn't have to split up whatever the gui tarn plaintiff gets.   The first filer is a race to the courthouse.   Do we know in this case -- there were three suits. Thorpe, I think, was the first. Do we know why those suits dropped out?   And you say that kills it for every -- anybody else.   Relator two is treated as the Government for this purpose.
126, Orig. +++$+++    And I thought it was it was agreed that the compact itself doesn't govern imported water, which this procedure covers. So if it's not within the compact itself, then how can it stand?   But I thought that that the parties were not aware of the error that proved beneficial to Kansas. So you say that there were many compromises, tradeoffs, but in this particular result, the parties were not aware that the accounting procedures would include this imported water.   Did you -- did you -- suggest that there were other issues like this that favored Nebraska, so that if the accounting procedure was going to be opened up on this point, that there were other things the special master should have considered?   What would happen -- I think Justice Breyer asked you -- if it goes to the commission and they are unable to agree? What's the next step?
13-1010 +++$+++    But the -- we're dealing with a case where there isn't silence. I mean, it's a matter of construing what the words mean, but for example, this collective bargaining agreement says that the employees will receive a full company contribution toward the cost of health benefits. That's not silent.   Where does --   Where does -- where does ordinary contract interpretation reguire a clear statement?   Well, you keep saying when there is silence, and as Justice Kagan pointed out and as I pointed out, one side is not silent. There are always indicia that vesting was intended.   But could you have -- if the collective bargaining agreement has expired, you have your duration clause, and the company instead of saying, retirees, we're going to make you contribute something to the health care, says: Well, the contract expired; no health coverage at all for retirees. Under your theory, I assume they could do that.   But the fact --   Is it your position that once the contract expires, the employer is free to say no health coverage for retirees, period?   How about "Retirees will receive health benefits as long as they are eligible for and receiving a monthly pension"? Doesn't that sound like as long as they're getting the pension, they will get health benefits?   Why do you have to -- why do you have to do that? If you want to treat them as separate, treat them as separate. Don't tie them together. There was nothing that reguired these two to be tied together.   I thought that the district court on remand said it would have come out the same way anyway. They said there are no facts that would defeat this same conclusion.   Are you saying it does continue as to the spouse? I didn't get the point.
13-1019 +++$+++    Well, it's kind of an odd conciliation, isn't it? This is -- EEOC is supposed to try to settle the matter. But there is no mutual obligation on the other side. There's no obligation at all on the part of the employer to cooperate to do anything.   Let's not skip over the time provision as irrelevant so guickly. Because it's the 30 days -- 30 days -- EEOC can sue within 30 days of the charge; isn't that right?   So Congress couldn't think that this was any kind of an onerous reguirement if all they have is 30 -- within 30 days they can say, okay, we told them that -- that what -- what the complaint is, they didn't come up with anything and so end of conciliation.   But you've already -- you recognized in -- in the prior exchange that there -- this is nothing like bargaining. Bargaining is reciprocal. Both sides have a duty to bargain in good faith.   Here there is no duty at all on the part of the employer. It just says EEOC tried to conciliate.   Well, can we take -- take this case?   The EEOC did send a letter saying --   -- give us a call. And the charge here is the employer violated Title VII because he outright refused to hire women. And there is lots of evidence of that. There are no women working there. They build a new facility; they don't have a women's bathroom in it. They hire people that are recommended to them by the current employees and the current employees are all male and recommend all men. Now, what -- what was the EEOC to conciliate about?   Wouldn't the employer have to come up and say something like, okay, we'll -- we'll agree that we'll hire women?   You left out one person.   The complainant. As I understand it, to break the confidentiality all the participants have to agree. And the employer might agree, but the employee hasn't been heard from.   But if it is confidential, that is plain in the statute.   Because they consider it -- and I think you can't quarrel with it; this is what Congress intended -- as a highly informal proceeding. They don't want a -- a bunch of procedural regulations.   Now, we just started with a tremendous difference. A mutual obligation to bargain and the subjects of bargaining are well-known. You're can bargain about wages. You can bargain about hours, about working conditions. This is quite different.   Why is it satisfactory --
13-1032 +++$+++    Mr. Isaacson, can we get to the nub of this guestion? We have your petition, the fact it is a restriction on the Court's jurisdiction. But you recognize that the TIA does cover regulations that reguire an employer to report an employer's -- an employee's taxable income. That's a straight reporting reguirement, and you recognize that that's covered by the TIA. So this is another information reporting that will enable or facilitate the State's collection of its tax. So what's the difference? Why -- why is it that the one comes under the TIA and not the other?   How successful are any of those methods? You can have as much notice as you want to the taxpayer, but most people are not going to pay the use tax if they don't think the government could find out that they bought something in another State.
13-1034 +++$+++    Suppose -- suppose the State's list was identical to the Federal list. You still don't know which particular. We know, but it's not part of the charge.   So Kansas has an identical list.   And if it has one that's different, not deportable?   Well, we don't know what substance -- in this case, we don't.   It's not charged. So it's not an element.   So it's not -- it's the difference that --   It -- it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to say deportable if the lists are identical, but if Kansas has one more on the list not deportable.   So you don't get any help by what seems to be the case, that this sock would not count as drug paraphernalia if we were -- if we were dealing with a Federal prosecution.   But the guestion I wanted to ask --   -- is a sock considered drug paraphernalia under Federal law?
13-1041 +++$+++    What about, Mr. Kneedler, this particular kind of interpretation? Is -- is this an unusual situation or in classifying employees for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act, does -- has the agency changed its mind about an initial classification? I mean, here we have the agency has taken different views on whether loan offices qualify as administrative offices. Is -- is the Fair Labor Standards Act subject to this kind of review and revision by the department?   Suppose -- suppose a court had given, quote, "controlling deference" to the 2006 rule. Does that make any difference?
13-1074 +++$+++    Is the -- is the word "jurisdiction" used?   That's the Court. Congress did not say jurisdiction. And I -- I'm sure you are well aware that this Court, for some time now, has been explaining that "jurisdiction" is a word of many meanings, too many meanings, and has tried to distinguish jurisdiction, meaning subject matter or personal, from the rules, once a case fits jurisdiction, how it will be processed in the Court. And it seems to me a time limitation, even a very stringent time limitation, is not jurisdictional.   But not the Tort Claims Act. The Tucker Act, I think the -- the line that the Court drew, it said if we characterize these as jurisdictional in a prior case, we will stick with that. But in the future, we're not doing that anymore.   What was different about 1972? They were pre-Irwin. So why wouldn't 19 -- a 1972 statute, the extension of Title VII to federal employees, why wouldn't that fall under the old regime instead of the fresh look that Irwin took of it in 1990 as applied to a 1972 statute?   Tucker Act doesn't have to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same extent as with respect to a private party. That's new in the Tort Claims Act.   I thought Soriano was -- was a Tucker Act case.   But if the sovereign immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would be overcome in every case against the government because government --   But, Mr. Martinez, what you said, it's as though the choice were statute of limitations or nothing. To get eguitable tolling, it's a pretty tough case. In order to get eguitable tolling, you must have a truly exceptional case, maybe the case that we're now -- that's now before us is such a case. But it is not easy to get eguitable tolling. You have to be especially deserving. So isn't that the answer to it? Ordinarily, the statute of limitations will govern, but if there are eguitable reasons, then there can be an exception. But those reasons have to be very strong.   As far as Kontrick is concerned, that line of cases I thought came out with Bowles, Bowles v. Russell, and John R. Sand that we're not going to undeclare something jurisdictional that we, the Court, but when it's -- we're dealing with a statute that this Court has never said that about, then we don't carry over that ancient regime.   I better take another look at Kontrick.   In Bowles I was in dissent.
13-1075 +++$+++    I thought at least if a statute passed tomorrow, we have the clear statement rule that we have said -- we have told Congress if you don't want to have any tolling, if you want this to be jurisdictional, absolutely rigid, you say so, and of course, Congress, it's your call. But we're not going to interpret a statute that doesn't make that clear statement as jurisdiction.   Because this Court had before -- had before said that provision about how much time you have to appeal, that that was jurisdictional. And I thought the Court's position was we decided it once, and we're going to stick with it. But if we haven't decided it, then we look at it. We look for a clear statement.   I don't -- I don't guite get the identical language because "shall be barred," I mean, that's common to a lot of statute of limitations. You're not suggesting that this would be different if it just said "shall be barred" rather than "forever barred," are you?   That was -- that was the way everything was -- involving the government and sovereign immunity was all, guote, "jurisdictional." And then we said -- and if -- if Congress made a statute, we said, well, we call that jurisdictional. Congress never called it jurisdictional. Then we took a fresh look at this, and we said that's -- that's an exorbitant use of the word "jurisdiction." Sure, you can have a -- you can have a statute that has a very tight time line; that doesn't mean it's jurisdictional.   Well, it was responding to our cases that use "jurisdiction."   Ms. Prelogar, I do think that the -- the other side's account, Mr. Schnapper's account of the Westfall Act, the one that Congress was intending to benefit was not the plaintiff, not the injured plaintiff. It was the Federal employee, because until Westfall v. Erwin, the Federal employee was off the hook. He wasn't -- so then when this Court, said, Federal employee, you are going to be stuck, then Congress passed a relief measure for the Federal employee, not -- not the plaintiff.   But every statute that it applied to in Irwin was enacted, how many years, 18 years before Irwin.
13-1080 +++$+++    Can we -- can we get back to the arbitrator? I think the Chief asked that guestion that -- and we passed it and assume it's regulatory.   The arbitrator, it's argued, need not be a government officer. It could be a private officer. I have a guestion to ask about that provision. Is it -- is this a one-time operation, that is, the setting these metrics and standards? In -- in fact, there were no arbitrator in this picture. Will there be a renewal of this, a repetition where there might be an arbitrator?
13-1174 +++$+++    Doesn't Rule 58 say unless otherwise provided?   So they -- automatic entry of judgment doesn't happen if the district judge specifically otherwise provides.   Mr. Goldstein, as -- as your view of the case is 54 (b) would not be appropriate --   -- when the -- when the judge says, I dismiss this claim entirely. This complaint is out. It's a final judgment. It's not appropriate for Rule 54 because Rule 54 (b) is when one claim is done, but other claims are still pending.   There's one huge difference. The district judge can say no to 54(b) if it's a final judgment. In this -- in this very case, that's exactly what the judge said. In the first round, he said, you have an appeal of right, and -- she said to the plaintiff who was dismissed. And then when the Second Circuit said no, she refused to give a 54 (b) .   I don't think this court of appeals said as a matter of its discretion, and that was one thing that puzzled me about your presentation. The court of appeals said we have no jurisdiction. That's guite different from saying we have discretion.   They said we had no jurisdiction.   They said they -- they -- there was a -- there's a phrase that the Second Circuit uses, and it -- something to the effect of an extraordinary case, an exceptional case.   But their main rule is there's no jurisdiction.   But you asked -- you asked to be part of the MDL case, didn't you?   Mr. -- Mr. Goldstein, following up the -- what has been called disingenuous. If no judgment -- if there is no final judgment, the judge says, this is how I'm going to rule, but I'm going to defer making the ruling.   That party still is in the case --   -- and can participate in discovery. Your strong point, I thought, was, here, they said I'm out of the case. Can't participate in it anymore because I have no standing according to the district judge --   -- and yet I have to wait six years or however -- however long the MDL proceedings go on. So it says you're out, but you can't appeal.   I don't see anything in the rules about it, and this is the first time I've heard about this administrative --   -- complaint.
13-1175 +++$+++    Mr. Rosenkranz, are you saying then that the police can do this -- can reguest these records on demand, and they don't have to have any reason at all -- no reasonable suspicion, no probable cause, nothing -- because the purpose is to deter people from staying in hotels who might do bad things. So no -- nothing like a reasonable suspicion reguirement.
13-1211 +++$+++    I thought the Court said if we're trying to type these things, claim construction is construction of a written instrument. That's the kind of thing --   -- that judges do all the time. But to determine whether there is -- whether the magic words, "same continuing commercial impression to consumers," then the one's that's better equipped to make that determination are people who are consumers, not jurists.   It's almost every hornbook statement of it is -- quotes that language. Even the Federal Circuit case that goes your way said that that -- that is, the question is whether the old and new mark convey the same continued commercial impression to consumers.   Well, aural or visual appearance, shouldn't that also -- aural and visual to whom? To the people likely to buy these products, not to the judge.   As I understand your brief, you say, no, the test really isn't same continuing commercial impression to consumers. You are saying it's the scope of -- the scope of the old and the new, and you can't use tacking to expand what the old would have meant.   But if the answer to that is that of course you can't; if you are saying that the old one was the first use, then whatever the scope of the old one is, is it, and you can't add to it because of what you did later.   Well, why -- wait. Explain why I was wrong in saying all they have to know is what was the scope of the original mark, the one that counts? The later change can't expand what was the original. So that seems to answer what you say -- you seem to say, this same continuing commercial, that's not it. It's what is the scope of the old mark and what is the scope of the new mark.   And if the answer is that the new mark can't go beyond the scope of the old, that's the -- that's the end of that inquiry.   But what I -- what I was trying to suggest is you would never get to what the second mark scope is because the scope of the first one is determinative.   Did you spell that out in your blue brief? I know that's your -- your yellow brief says this -- everything is wrong up until now because it's a legal question, preemptive scope of the old mark and of the new mark. That's pointed out very clearly in your reply brief, but I didn't see it in the blue brief.
13-1314 +++$+++    But it's all right for the State redistricting. The commission is -- is -- there's no constitutional guestion with the -- Arizona being able to use this commission for its State representation.   Could Congress -- could Congress do that? Could Congress substitute this commission for the State's legislature?   But couldn't -- could Congress bless what Arizona has done by saying that's a matter in which Federal elections will be held?   I thought -- I thought -- Mr. Clement, I thought that the initiative and referendum came in later, that at the time of the founding, and the initiative and the referendum weren't used by State legislatures.
13-1333 +++$+++    Does that include a petition for cert or is it only the first level appeal?   So until there's a petition filed and it's denied or until the time expires to file the petition.   Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain that distinction from the court of appeals level? So the district court dismisses for failure to state a claim. It goes up to the court of appeals. When would the court of appeals simply affirm and when would it say "appeal dismissed"?   I thought in this case there was no such preclusion. I thought the Court of Appeals said, yeah, we'll take the appeal on the strike. So that's -- that's -- you can't urge that issue because you prevailed on it.   Mr. Shanmugan, why isn't this case just a casebook example of what the danger is? Because this Petitioner, as I understand it, filed not only the petition that's before us, but three more. In what span of time?
13-1352 +++$+++    Mr. Meyer, could you explain one anomaly in this case? The child, three and a half years old, is incompetent to appear in court as a witness. How can the substitute be permissible? If the child is incompetent to testify in court, why isn't the child incompetent to testify out -- make the same statement out of court?   Could you remind us, the young people who -- who heard this child's utterances, what -- did their statements come in? The grandmother -- was it the grandmother, the aunt, the social worker, and the police, what happened to their statements?   But the teachers didn't violate -- the teachers -- that was an hearsay exception; is that right?   Well, then what -- if all the others were -- were inadmissible under Ohio's own hearsay rule, why wouldn't the same thing apply to the teacher? What's the difference between the teacher and the social worker?   I thought it was either -- that the school teacher could notify either the social worker or the police.
13-1371 +++$+++    On the basis of --   But after that language is the phrase "on the basis of," race, sex, whatever. So it's adversely affect on the basis of the -- whatever the category.   Do -- do we take into account at all that in both Title VII and the Fair Housing Act, there was a grand goal that Congress had in mind? It meant to undo generations of rank discrimination. And what was the phrase that this Court used in Trafficante to describe the Fair Housing Act? That its objective was to replace ghettos by integrating -- "integrated living patterns," just as Title VII was meant to undo a legacy of rank employment discrimination. So doesn't that purpose give a -- a clue to what Congress was after?   But If we're going to be realistic about this, in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act passed, and in 1968, when the Fair Housing Act passed, nobody knew anything about disparate impact. That didn't come up till the Griggs decision, and it was this Court that gave that interpretation to Title VII in light of the purpose of the statute. So to try to look back and say, oh, did they mean disparate impact in '64, when Griggs wasn't on the books till '71, it's a little artificial, don't you think?   What was the reason for --   What was the reason for it? You can say it's a neutral, 10 percent is neutral; but it's just glaring in the face that the legislature that passed this was very much race-conscious. It was the way that they saw of getting a minority population into colleges. I don't think there's really a doubt that factually that's what prompted the 10 percent plan. When the University of Texas was told its affirmative action plan was no good, then the legislature came back with the 10 percent plan.
13-1402 +++$+++    But the consular, you have denied --   Is there -- is there no -- is there no exception to the consular nonreviewability doctrine? That is, assuming people make mistakes, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, bureaucrats -- some consulates -- consuls have been known to have a bureaucratic mentality and some may act for improper reasons. But you are sticking to the position that consular determinations are not subject to judicial review on any -- any and all circumstances, no exceptions?   But that can't be. That process can't be initiated by the relative. That's an internal -- you have described an internal check. But as in this case, the wife, she won't know whether that check has gone.   Can the person -- the relative who's claiming preferential status -- can she initiate such a review? She can't. It's entirely internal.   And was given -- given the same -- the -- her representative was given the same answer, citing the statute and saying we -- we don't disclose any particulars.   Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, could you give us an idea, before you conclude, about what has been the consequence of a decision? The Ninth Circuit in this Bustamante case -- that was 2008 -- what has happened in the Ninth Circuit between 2008 and 2014 with respect to these relative applications? How have they fared?   But in the cases that we have, you cited extending it to a child, but have any of them held that the government failed to show a facially legitimate bona fide reason?
13-1487 +++$+++    Did  I didn't -- I thought that before the district court there was only first, his friend, then his mother, and then another friend. Where did he ask the court to allow the guns to be sold by a licensed gun dealer?   But that doesn't mention anything about a gun dealer, and he had been guite specific about the persons to whom he wanted the guns transferred.   Is there any point in the references that you made where he said to the court, "I would like these guns to be consigned to a licensed gun dealer"?   How do you -- how does one tell -- let's take the two people -- two friends that you opposed -- suggested transferring them to, or his wife so they could stay within the family. How does the Court know whether that transfer will give him access to the guns so that he will have possession?   And who -- who makes the arrangement? Who selects the gun dealer and makes the arrangement for the consignment? Does the court do that --   -- or does Henderson do it?
13-1499 +++$+++    Mr. Pincus, whatever the standard, suppose the Florida rule was simply no face-to-face solicitations. That's it. Would you concede that that would be a valid regulation or would that fall under the First Amendment as well?   I want to understand your view of the scope of the First Amendment in relation to the selection of -- the election of judges.   But the First Amendment would not allow that for the candidate for political office.   So you are making it you are recognizing that there's a difference between judicial office -- that the First Amendment allows the State to do things with respect to the election of judges that it wouldn't allow them to do with respect to the election of members of the legislature.   Yeah, but I just asked you -- you gave me an answer and now are you telling me that that answer was ill considered? That is, a ban on face-to-face solicitation by candidates for judicial office, good or not? And it -- would it be judged by the same standard as a ban on face-to-face solicitation by political --   So if Florida law didn't let them do that -- what I'm trying to find out is if you think you can have different rules for judicial elections than you can have for political elections. I mean, we're told by the Florida judges who filed a brief, that they had a horrendous problem with corruption and they wanted to get a handle on it. So they made this small step.   And they --   Suppose a state's view is we want the -- our judiciary to be above the political fray so we have this kind of restriction on putting themselves forward as -- as the solicitor.   So Florida could regulate the already elected judge when he's running for reelection?   And he could say, we have a rule: Judges don't solicit, period, for charities, for themselves. So we have a judge; he's a State employee. I take it from your answer and in applying Pickering to government employee that the sitting judge can be restricted.   The whole -- but the whole effort on Florida's part is to make the selection of judges not like the political context. And you -- what you're saying is that they -- if they choose to elect their judges, they can do it only one way and the same rules apply to the judges that apply to candidates for the State legislature.
13-212 +++$+++    Mr. Dreeben, something that you said about the encryption. What -- what is the experience of the police? Isn't it so that most cell phones when they're found on a person are not open, that -- that they are locked?   What do you mean by scope? You can look at e-mails but not something else? What would the scope limitation be?
13-271 +++$+++    It's not --   But do you agree that FERC does not have the exclusive authority because you have conceded that a federal antitrust claim would be okay. So FERC is not the sole regulator. There's room for federal antitrust claims.   Well, suppose the state law -- and I think this is true of many states -- just mirrors the federal antitrust law, it's the same. It's the same substantive regulation.   Can FERC give a remedy to the consumers who are involved with the Plaintiffs in this case?   But FERC at this time.   Can you explain -- can you explain something? The government recommended that we deny cert in this case, and the government's reason was the case lacked prospective importance. So what is the situation today with the Energy Policy Act?   Your point about juries would apply to the Sherman Act as well.
13-352 +++$+++    Mr. Jay, there are exceptions to preclusion even though you would see the identical issue, and one of them is when the stakes are higher in the second proceeding than in the first and, indeed, the restatement of judgments. Do you have some examples of that? And it seems to me this is such a case, because it's one thing to say that we won't register your mark and another to say you can't use the mark.   I don't think that your example of small claims court is the closest. There's one on Exception 83, which is determinations by an administrative tribunal, and the example it gives is of a scheme that contemplates an agency proceeding to be as expeditious as possible. And one way of assuring expeditiousness is to confine the stakes to the matter immediately in controversy.   The matter of controversy is registration, and in the second proceeding, it's infringement.   But  but the person who uses the mark could continue to use it. And the reason the restatement gives before the expeditious first proceeding is that you don't want to make that proceeding pull out all the stops because it's going to be determinative of the infringement suit.   Were those in days before you could get a jury trial in a Title VII case?   What disturbed the Eighth Circuit on that point was that the jury would be powerfully confused; it has enough to deal with what the charge in the infringement case is.   Well, how do you respond to the question I asked Mr. Jay, that is, as the Restatement of Judgments says, if one aspect of the first proceeding is to assure expeditiousness, then confining the stakes to that issue of registration makes sense so that the parties will not be induced to dispute the administrative proceeding in anticipation of its effect on another proceeding.   There are some differences. There's no live testimony, right.
13-433 +++$+++    Mr. Clement, is it  is it irrelevant that we're told here that because there are not enough security checkers and because all the shifts get out at the same time, what could be a five-minute process turns out to be 25 minutes, 25 minutes of the workers' time, and 20 of those allegedly would not occur if the employer had -- provided sufficient staffing.   You said in your brief that there are some security searches that would be compensable. So would you tell us which ones are and which ones aren't?   Yes.   You can't think of an example, then, where a security check, an exit security check, would be compensable?
13-435 +++$+++    So you're saying that this evidence, what we're -- we're talking about, the evidence that the speaker didn't believe what he said, that could be proved by showing he made no investigation at all.   So -- so you're saying that the -- whether there was any investigation or whether it was reasonable will factor into whether the belief was honestly held.   But why -- and we're dealing with a registration statement. Why isn't it, as Justice Breyer suggested, implicit that when somebody -- when an issuer puts something in a registration statement, that the issuer has acted with diligence in making that statement?   You say that about Bankshares, which contains the statement that the Government refers to; conclusory opinions in a commercial context are reasonably understood to rest on a factual basis that justifies them as accurate.   Mr. Shanmugam, I thought that the complaint alleged that the defendants had no -- that no defendant had a reasonable ground to believe that Omni shares arrangements were lawful.
13-502 +++$+++    Well, what are -- what are you seeking? Do you -- do you want whatever is the most favorable rule, say, for ideological signs? Is that what you want? Or do you accept that it could be some limit on event signs, say, some reasonable time limit?   But the ideological isn't time unlimited.   The same treatment as political signs, then, is that --
13-517 +++$+++    I thought that the whole rationale behind this is we don't want to invade the jury province with information about what went on in the jury room. And that's a pretty old rule. And some people might think it makes no sense. You can have an eavesdropper, and that's okay, but you can't have a juror itself. So this, what's involved here is a juror reporting what she heard during the deliberations. And it seems to me that's exactly the kind of thing that is not permitted.   But it's too easy to convert anything that occurs in the jury room as reflecting on the voir dire. So the judge instructs the jury. Can you follow my instructions? Oh, yes, I can follow my instructions. In the jury room, that juror says: Oh, come on, let's just average it all up and go home. Didn't -- didn't follow instructions. On your theory that could come in, because it goes to dishonesty at the voir dire stage.   Well, perhaps if you prevail. Why not?   But what is the strong evidence of intentional dishonesty in this case? The woman says: I can judge this case fairly, I can award damages. And one of the other things that the judge instructs the jury: You can take account of your own life experience. What is so blatant about that? How do we infer that she intended to be dishonesty at the time of the voir dire?   But you're taking a case that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about what -- what -- the deliberations in the jury room. I think you're using the case for much more than it's worth, much more than the opinion writer put into it. It just didn't present the guestion of what about a juror testifying about the deliberations in the jury room.   That was leaving out the conspicuous difference, there was no jury verdict impugned in the contempt case.   Can you explain the manner in which the jury reached its verdict? I thought that the testimony of Titus was she made this statement about her daughter and she persuaded all the other jurors to go along with her. That's the manner in which the jury reached its verdict. It didn't follow the law, it followed what this woman was alleged to have said.
13-534 +++$+++    Here, in this case, they didn't enforce State law. One puzzle in this case: Why should there be an antitrust exemption for conduct that is not authorized by state law? The objection here was that this board was issuing a whole bunch of cease and desist orders. They had no authority to do that. No authority at all.   But why is it entirely reasonable to say, yes, this can be a State actor, but because they are made at the same time the State says they must be in private practice. So they're both the State actor and they're private actor. So yes, you can have such a board, but there needs to be a check of supervision; that is, they can't just go make their regulations without approval from some State entity and they can't go around issuing cease and desist orders. They have to come to a court. If they want to -- and the court would act as the check. Why shouldn't -- because of the risk that these people have the self-interest, why shouldn't there be a check of the kind that Midcal --   And what is that clearly articulated policy?   But is there any clear policy that teeth whitening is the practice of dentistry? I thought that that was determined before -- the standard about removing stains on teeth, that that was before anybody ever knew about whitening.   But how can it be clearly articulated when the problem being addressed didn't even exist when the -- when the policy was --   The antitrust exemption is a matter of State law -- of Federal law, not State law. So it's -- the Federal law sets the dimensions of what fits within the State action. It's not up to the State to create the State action exemption. It's Federal law and what its metes and bounds are are also Federal law.   Tell me if I'm wrong about this, but I thought that the State action exemption was adopted and announced by this Court.   And that's nothing spelled out in a -- in a law.   But there's -- there's another factor that the State has stipulated, that is, the State has said "and the members of this board must be private practitioners." That -- that is not your typical State agency.   And may be so, and that's why the FTC says we need a check, we need the Midcal check of some genuine State supervision over private --   Let's say they have to be because they are, by State law, they must be private practitioners. They cannot be full-time civil servants.   They can't be on this board unless you are a regularly practicing dentist.   When you --
13-550 +++$+++    You also said, did you not, that -- that there was this committee that met periodically to review investments? I think you said they met guarterly.   And that there had been, as a result of those guarterly reviews, changes --   -- in investments.
13-553 +++$+++    Well, why -- why do you say handpicked? I -- I -- they're in the business of transporting goods, motor carriers are and railroads are.
13-604 +++$+++    Mr. Fisher, I have a preliminary guestion. Even if you -- you're right about mistake of law, isn't it a moot guestion in this case because, as I understand it, the traffic stop ended with a warning citation. So the traffic stop was over. And at that point, the police officer asked if he can inspect the car, and the answer is yes. Why isn't the consent to the search the end of this case?   But North Carolina has a rule, I thought, that if you violate the Fourth Amendment, that's it. We don't -- we don't have a good-faith exception.   But isn't that -- isn't that -- isn't that what the North Carolina law is now? So it would be futile to send it back for them to answer the good-faith exception since they have none.
13-628 +++$+++    The -- the -- does -- the provision is part of a section, Section 214. And I think you're trying to read G, and so it is disassociated from the purpose that's expressed throughout 214, that is, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Congress said that, and you -- you are trying to deal with a piece of one section without regard to the -- to the thrust of the whole provision, that Congress has said we think Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.   I want -- and I must interject at this point because you emphasize the Taiwan example and it seems to me it's most distinguishable. Taiwan and China maintained from the beginning there is only one China, and so Taiwan is a place name. It's a region. It's in no way recognizing, no -- there's no guestion of recognition in the Taiwan example.   What about Palestinians who were born in Jerusalem and want to have Palestine as their place of birth? That -- that existed until 1948, that option.
13-6827 +++$+++    If this prisoner wanted to have a full beard, would RLUIPA reguire that the prison administration allow him to do that?   And the standard is other similar risks. The same way, then, what about a 1/4-inch rule? Because that's what they allowed for people who have dermatological problems.   There are -- there are some religious practices -- I think that the Sikh practice of not cutting hair ranks as a religious practice. So not cutting hair and wearing a turban, consistent with what you say is the standard, could a prison say, we won't allow that because it is too easy to hide contraband?   Didn't this Court establish --   Mr. Yang, before you sit down, your brief lists a whole series of cases on page 14 that were decided before RLUIPA. Safley and a bunch of others. Are all those practices which we approved up for grabs now under RLUIPA? There -- there were restrictions on receipt of publications was one.   So they would -- all those that we approved, correspondence limitations, all those would have to be looked at anew under the RLUIPA standard.   What about the argument that there's no comparison, that Arkansas is unigue in the way it houses its prisoners, and that the rules that were cited elsewhere have to do with minimum security facilities?
13-684 +++$+++    Before -- before you do, Mr. Frederick, you are recognizing that the only recourse the lender has if the borrower is -- is claiming something that is baseless, the only recourse is to bring a declaratory judgment action?   How would that apply in this case where I take it the -- the lender's position is we're being charged with not providing a second copy, and we did provide a second copy; therefore, this is a baseless claim.
13-7120 +++$+++    Should the Court should the Court take into account that in the sentencing guidelines possession of a short-barreled shotgun is ranked under career, is under the career offenses?   You pointed out in your brief that explosives -- one of the enumerated crimes is use of explosives, but is no -- anywhere a crime of possession.
13-719 +++$+++    But I thought Hohn, which I think you used as explaining why the case is in the court of appeals, but Hohn said the only thing that you can review is the COA, certificate of appealability. You can't use that handle to get to the merits. So the only guestion is whether the certificate was improperly denied and not the merits.   The reason is that any careful lawyer in the Tenth Circuit will -- will know that we -- we'd better put the evidence in the notice of removal. So a lawyer is not going to risk failing to do that to make -- to correct the Tenth Circuit's error.
13-7211 +++$+++    The argument is that what the judgment was is the relief that you got is a new sentencing hearing shorn of the particular errors the district court found and those particular errors did not relate to the closing argument. So you are trying to say we had a judgment, we won, and ordinarily a judgment winner can appeal if they won and if there is an argument that was made on which the judgment won or lost, that is not preclusive because he didn't have a chance to appeal. A judgment winner can't appeal. But this is peculiar because the -- there were -- the -- the order is you are entitled to a new trial shorn of these particular errors. The court of appeals says they are not errors. And then you want to bring up another error.   But why are we talking about the claim on which you lost on appeal? You are not going to get a chance to go back with disadvantaged, with mental health, because you lost on those on appeal.   I thought the Wiggins claims were rejected on appeal.   May I just clarify it?   Everything that you are arguing rides on our treating ineffective assistance of counsel as one claim rather than ineffective assistance of counsel, confrontation clause, some other violation. If we don't buy your argument that ineffective assistance of counsel is one monolithic claim and we think the division between what they -- what they're calling Wiggins error and the -- those --   -- you would lose.   Are you saying that the COA statute itself says you need a COA to appeal from the final order and you don't want to appeal from the final order because you like the final order?
13-7451 +++$+++    Why should -- why should the expression "tangible object," which stands alone, it's not falsifying documents, why should the word "object" in 1519 be treated differently than the word "other object" in 1512 -- 1512(c)?   So you think there's a difference between "tangible object" and "other object"?   But then the Congress could have said used -- tangible object used to preserve information, and then your case would be solid. But it just said "tangible object."   Then how do you -- how do you respond to the illustration that the government gave in its brief? That is, what sense does it make to say you can be indicted under 1519 if you destroy a letter that the victim that you have murdered has sent you, but you can't be indicted under 1519 if you destroy the murder weapon?   But you think it could -- would -- let me back up and ask what I assume was -- you would say yes to. A letter is shredded. It's a letter from the victim to the later-turned-out-to-be murderer. That letter is shredded. Does that come under 1519?   Isn't -- isn't running a fishing vessel a business?   Can you -- can you tell me the exact conseguences for your client? Because as I understand it, he was also charged under 22 -- what is it -- 2232?   And he could have gotten the same sentence?   But he in fact got what? 30 days.   But you're only arguing for your client. This is not some kind of class action.
13-854 +++$+++    Can you bring it down to this case and tell -- tell us what are the facts to which the Federal Circuit should have applied clearly erroneous rule?   Then maybe the evidence shouldn't have come in.   The evidence should not have come in.   If these are -- these are truly fact guestions, then what happened to the Seventh Amendment?   And the government's brief said -- and I think you agree with this, but you'll tell me -- that inferences to be drawn from fact-findings get de novo review. And my understanding is that in a typical civil case, a jury finds the facts and can draw inferences from the facts, but here -- well, first do you agree with the government that inferences from -- from the facts get de novo review?   Why does the government disagree with you about that?   From the facts that you say are facts and the government says do not qualify as to their test.
13-894 +++$+++    At what point was -- was MACLean told that this gualified an -- as SSI? Correct me if I'm wrong about this, but as I understood it, he was fired, and it wasn't until the case was before the MSPB that a determination was made that this information gualified as -- as what you call SSI.   But when was he first told?   What --   But now you think -- you seem to be arguing that it's not simply mandated by statute. You use the two FOIA examples that you gave was authorized or permitted. So what is your position today? Before the Federal Circuit, it seems to have been this is statute, not regulations. Now it's some regulations, but we don't know whether regulations that are mandated or regulations that are merely authorized. What is it?   One  there was one view that by going to "law" rather than "statute" what was meant was to include judicial decisions.   Do you know how come that is, Mr. Gershengorn?   How common it is to have regulations specifically mandated as opposed to authorized or permitted.
13-895 +++$+++    Mr. Pildes, because -- because your time is running out --   -- there is -- in your presentation, you're saying we are attacking the statewide plan. We are not picking one district or the other. And you have been attacked on that point. The attack is that Shaw claims have to be district by district; they can't be statewide. So I would like your answer to that question. There hasn't been a Shaw claim, as far as I know, that was statewide. They have all been district by district.   But you mean had specific -- in your proposed findings, you dealt specifically with certain districts and not specifically with others.
13-9026 +++$+++    This case -- this case didn't involve a single step. But you say whatever it was, nine feet, it's de minimis. If you are right about that, then this charge never should have gone to the jury because is -- is the jury supposed to say what is de minimis or is the judge supposed to say that?   In an ordinary use it doesn't. Justice Scalia gave one example. Suppose I were to say, the nurse accompanied a patient as she walked around the Intensive Care Unit. That's an ordinary use of the -- of "accompanied."   I'm sorry, I would like to stop you for a minute. Because I thought that the -- the killing was one thing. But it -- it wasn't -- there -- didn't the judge say you didn't ask for -- what was it --   -- death results, right.   So this -- this jury -- I mean the issue of causing the death, that wasn't charged and the defendant was not acguitted of that?   But here it wasn't a single step. And it seems from what happened that this case presents a very danger that (e) wants to guard against. That is, the woman is terrified and she had a heart attack.
13-935 +++$+++    The government agrees with the Petitioner that the first question, what goes into this estate, that if we had to choose between the two, which would you say is the more important?
13-975 +++$+++    But decision -- decision, Mr. Fisher, often means just denied. There -- there is one statute was mentioned in the brief at -- this is 47 U.S.C. 546 (c)(3), "The franchising authority shall issue a written decision." That's one sentence. Next sentence, "Such decision shall state the reasons therefore." So the reguirement of a decision alone doesn't necessitate that reasons be given.   Your bottom line is because of this supposed default, you get your -- your application is granted, and that seems odd when the thrust of this arrangement is that the decision should be in the hands of the local governing board or the local council or something. And then to say because of the procedural lapse, then you emerge the winner and it doesn't matter what good reasons the town might have 0 had.   Mr. Fisher, could you explain how you are disadvantaged? Now, first of all, what happens on remand to the district court in your view? The Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision, the case is remanded, what happens on remand?   Then what would ~ then if this Court should uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then what happens?   And what happens there?
13-983 +++$+++    How does one prove what's in somebody else's mind? This case, the standard was would a reasonable person think that the words would put someone in fear, and reasonable people can make that judgment. But how would the government prove whether this threat in the mind of the threatener was genuine?   And could you continue, you were telling me how that would be proved what is in his head. He knew that she or a reasonable person would be put in fear. So how does the government prove that?
13-9972 +++$+++    But that remains -- that wasn't reached by the court of appeals. The district -- the district court, as you pointed out, rejected the argument that there was probable cause saying if nothing more than a hunch. But that was not reviewed by the court of appeals. So that would still be open.   But the guestion is, is this -- is this very -- the easiest thing to get around by simply saying, would the seguence in which I will do this, I won't think of issuing the ticket until I've had the dog sniff? So that's the problem. And what are you accomplishing? Say, we make -- we make the handing over the ticket the end of the legitimate stop.   Well, then the police can just say, I'm going to defer that a few minutes until the dog sniff occurs. It just seems that you're not going to accomplish any protection for individuals if that's your position, that -- that it was just a guestion of when you do it. So if you do it during the stop, before the ticket issued, it's okay and if you do it two minutes after, it's not okay.   Mr. O'Connor, is this particular traffic violation, was that an arrestable offense?   It was not.   Because if it was an arrestable offense, they could arrest the driver and then impound the car and do an inventory search.   But you say it's not an arrestable offense.   Why -- why is it part? As the guestion he has suggested, it's unrelated to the traffic stop. You're looking to see if this person has a record, committed other crimes, for example. What has that got to do with whatever the traffic --   -- infraction is? Not stopping at a stop sign, what has checking to see if the defendant has a criminal record got to do with that?   It was only a hunch, but that would ordinarily be reviewable by the court of appeals. The court of appeals didn't get to it, so it's an open guestion for the court of appeals.
14-103 +++$+++    Mr. Streett, do you have a position on enhancements? If -- if the creditors say that enhancement is -- you did a good job but it's not worth the enhancement, is defending the enhancement also, under your rule, compensable?   How do you answer the guestion about suppose the objection to the fee is sustained? Does the lawyer, nonetheless, get the work?
14-114 +++$+++    Mr. Carvin, will you please back up, because before we get to a guestion of statutory construction, as you know, each plaintiff, or at least one plaintiff, has to have a concrete stake in these guestions. They can't put them as ideological guestions. And we have as -- four plaintiffs. As to two of them, there is a declaration stating "I am not eligible for health insurance from the government," but there's a guestion of whether they are veterans eligible for coverage as veterans.   I  I'll ask the government if they agree that --   But the Court has an obligation to look into it on its own.   I don't think it was ever brought up in the lower court that these -- these two people were veterans.   That's the government that's --   -- that's deposition to. And then there were the two women, I think one of them was going to turn 65 in June, which would make her Medicaid-eligible.   Per year?   But you said she will turn 65 in June.   So that takes care of 2015.   Then --   Again, I'll ask the government if they agree with you on that. And then I think for the fourth plaintiff, there's a guestion whether she would gualify for a hardship -- hardship exemption from the individual mandate even if she received the tax credit, in which case the tax credits would be irrelevant.   Yeah, but you have to --   But you would have to establish the standing, prove the standing.   If this gets beyond the opening door.   Okay. I don't want to detain you on this any more but I will ask the government what their position is on standing.   But this is -- this is guite different.   Mr. Carvin --   Mr. Carvin, here's a you refer to the Medicaid example. That's a familiar -- a grant-in-aid says to the State, here's the Federal money and here's the conditions, take it or leave it. That's one pattern. But this pattern that we have says flexible State. You can -- you can have your program if you want it, and if you don't, there's a fallback. There's the Federal program. I mean, that's a typical pattern. It's the pattern of the Clean Air Act. You can have a State implementation plan, but State, if you don't get up your plan, there's a Federal implementation plan. I have never seen anything like this where it's if you take what the statute says you can have in 1321, then you get these disastrous conseguences.   What -- what are those benefits? What are the customers that can buy on it? What are the insurers that will sell on it?   But it's a --   It's a tax code provision that's an implementation provision. It tells you how you compute the individual amount.   It -- it's not in the body of the legislation where you would expect to find this.   And if it --   What Justice Kagan just read to you, you had the idea that the subsidies were essential --   -- to have the thing work. That's what you told us last time.   Then why in the world would they set up this whole extra thing if they didn't think anybody was going to take it?
14-15 +++$+++    You wouldn't pay it.   We have an appendix to the red brief that cites some 57 cases. And is it your contention that those -- all of those cases fit into this mold of an affirmative -- anticipatory affirmative defense or regulation of primary conduct?   But why doesn't that  I mean, I thought that the rate that the providers can bill is the rate that CMS approves. So, first, maybe you should straighten out what is the rate. We did have the 2006 rate and that was approved by CMS. Did CMS approve the 2009 rate?   And there has been -- has been no approval of the 2009 rate then?   The  the recommended rate for 2009, the -- the rate that Idaho itself said was the appropriate rate, that CMS -- CMS did not pass on that.   If CSM thinks that that standard in (30)(A) isn't satisfied that they're not paying enough to enlist sufficient providers to provide the service, could CMS -- we're told in the briefs they can cut off funds. Could CMS sue this State and say, we want to enjoin you from paying less than what it takes to provide what (30)(A) calls for?   So you -- you agree that -- that CMS has never blessed this 2009 rate, the rate.

The answer she got back was, it doesn't matter whether it's for religious reasons. We don't -- we don't accommodate people who wear headscarfs.   So -- so it seems that the -- the district manager is -- his point of view is headscarfs are out. This particular woman was wearing one for religious reasons, but it doesn't matter what reason, we don't accommodate headscarfs.   Did the employer tell her -- did the employer tell her that it had this Look Policy --   -- that a headscarf would violate? How could she ask for something when she didn't know the employer had such a rule?   The   The Respondent says that you switched theories in midstream, that you started out with a refusal to accommodate theory and then you abandoned that. Is that --   -- not so?   Well, suppose they had. Their argument is that you get damages only for intentional.
