04-10566 +++$+++         Is there any other relief sought by the Petitioner?            There was the suppression request.         Was there any other?        Was there a request of the kind that the ICJ thought would be appropriate, which was, court, reconsider this and determine whether the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of Vienna Convention notice?        There's a question I would like to ask you about the State.                     Now, if everything worked ideally, it would be the police officer, along with the Miranda warnings, says, would you like to call your consulate.             You could do that if you wish.         If it -- if the State has an obligation to give this information under the treaty, but many police officers don't know anything about any Vienna Convention, do judges, Federal judges, State judges, have an obligation, when they see that an alien defendant is before them, to, on the judge's own motion, ask the prosecutor has he been told about the Vienna Convention, and if not, the judge would have an obligation to do so?            I thought the first time it was raised was on direct appeal by appellate counsel.             And the reason for the denial?             I think that counsel said that the -- the people at the consulate -- they tend to talk a lot?          Has it worked the other way around when a young American citizen is detained in -- in a jail someplace abroad, and has the United States ever then -- what efforts have been made?          Has it worked anyplace? Take Mexico, Turkey, any country you'd like.
04-1067 +++$+++           What is the case that says that, that the child's invitation overrides the parents' objection?          So --          -- would a mother-in-law. [Laughter.]          Mr. Goldstein, your time is almost up, but I want to know if you place any weight at all on the fact that the husband was the target in this case.         The target said, "No," and the one who wasn't under suspicion said, "Yes."                    Does that make any difference?
04-1084 +++$+++         But if the interest is defined, as Mr. Kneedler did -- that is, these drugs are "No, absolutely prohibited." -- then how can you have any less restrictive means?            It seems to me that you can -- I understand your argument about a compelling State interest has to be judged in context -- to the person, to this church.        But if Mr. Kneedler is correct that the compelling State interest is that this is a proscribed drug, then there can't be any least restrictive means.         Ms. Hollander, may I just, on this point -- it's the same question I raised with Mr. Kneedler.          We're talking about a preliminary injunction. Your side, I think, said, "Go for the permanent injunction.           We have a lot more to put in."        The presentation on the Treaty was rather thin, below.                     I take it from Mr. Kneedler's argument that he's saying the preliminary injunction, or not, is really the thing.                      If the Government wins, no preliminary injunction.                    There's not going to be any show for a permanent injunction.                      But, on your side of it, what more would you be putting in? Let's say you prevail at the preliminary injunction stage. Would you then say, "See, Judge, now you can enter a permanent injunction"?             Or you -- would you be putting in more evidence?            And if so, what kind?
04-1131 +++$+++         So your difference -- what s separating you and Whitman, it seems, is a question of timing.         The action that you re describing that would come at the end, after he s used the administrative process, is the same one that he is seeking to bring at the front end.                 That is, it s a 1331 action --        -- and -- and it s based on the Government s waiver of sovereign immunity for nonmonetary claims.         I thought your position on the statute was that it doesn t afford a right of action, that it was just an instruction to the Secretary.          Maybe I misread your position on the statute.         We re talking about 45-1048?        I thought that the Government s position was there s no right of action under that statute.            But that was on the view that it was an exclusive remedy.                    The -- the statute is not written in -- in any way as an exhaustion requirement.             It says you ve got a minor grievance -- issue.       You go through the grievance procedure.              There is no judicial review at the end of the line.                    So you would be converting something that Congress wrote to be an exclusive remedy into an exhaustion requirement.         So you -- you have picked one way to do that.          You say go through the grievance procedure.          If there s a constitutional question remaining, if you haven t been satisfied, then you bring the action in court. Another way to say is, well, as long as we re making this up, why not allow the -- the action to proceed at once in court, but then the court to say, I m going to abstain while you go through the grievance procedure.         Yes, I --        But -- but here, that s not this case because he said, and when I complained, they did it again.        Am I right that the statute as written says you don t have any judicial review for these kinds of actions?                 You go through the grievance procedure, win or lose.                That s it.   There is no judicial review.        The statute does not provide for judicial review --        -- as it does in the case of major actions.
04-1140 +++$+++           I --          -- think we do have three, if you count Fogerty, because you have the Christianson, which is the most defendant-friendly. And then you have Piggie Park, which is the most plaintiff-friendly.         And then you have Fogerty, which is been -- has been called the multifactor --          -- test.          Well, as it was just mentioned, "multifactor," in a footnote, it said it would be neutral.         I think the big point in Fogerty was that it was going to apply in both directions, be neutral as between plaintiff and defendant.          You've given us, in your multifactor test, you said, "objectively reasonable basis to remove."              And another factor might be that the plaintiff delayed in moving to remand.        What other factors, besides the "objectively reasonable basis to remove" and the plaintiff's delay?
04-1144 +++$+++               So why wouldn't it be entirely adequate to protect what you're concerned about to say this New Hampshire statute is unconstitutional to the extent that it fails to provide an exception for situations where there is imminent danger to health, and then all those immediate dangers to health situations would be left unregulated.              The statute doesn't reach them. But nonemergency cases would continue to be governed by the statute.                    Why couldn't -- in other words, why wasn't that the appropriate judgment for the First Circuit to have entered in this case, to say statutes fine for nonemergency cases, but for emergency cases, there is effectively no law?           But you wouldn't have -- it would be that the emergency is not regulated.          The private doctors can act in a medical emergency.          They are not controlled by any legislation.         If the model of this case, is doctors come to court, doesn't have to have an actual patient class action and the court says the statute cannot be applied to a medical necessity, period.        No fancy frills of adding another things which courts generally don't do.                 But then there would be no regulation of medical emergencies.                     Why isn't that what -- doesn't that fit the pattern of the case you've brought and couldn't the First Circuit have done that and then you would have no complaint about the rest of the statute?            Yes, I know that.
04-1152 +++$+++               And you would take, Mr. Rosenkranz, that same position.                   If this was not special to law faculties -- I mean, we're told that the recruiters could go to the main campus; most of these places, the restriction is limited to the law faculties.          Suppose it was universitywide policy that we do not give equal access to military recruiters.                     I think your argument says it doesn't matter if it's special to the law school or the whole university.                     Do I understand it correctly?            Would you require any accommodation -- I mean, you have said, "It's up to the faculty to choose which causes to assist" -- I think you put it that way, or one of the amici did -- "and which to resist."          And you've already told me that this happens to be the law school, could be the whole university.           Could the law faculty, or the university, take the position, "We're not going to -- we don't like your message, and we are not going to let you have any of our facilities.          We're not going give you the room on the main campus.           Just a total bar"?          No, but a school --          -- a school, as a matter of its own policy says, "We don't like discrimination, and we're not going to give discriminators access to any of our facilities, period."          I'm asking --          -- you, Is there any obligation, since you've said there is a compelling State interest -- compelling Government interest in recruiting, is there some obligation to accommodate, or could the faculty just say, "We choose the causes that we assist and the ones we resist"?           Yes.           I'm asking --           -- is the -- if it logically follows, from your position, about "choosing the causes we resist and the ones that we assist."
04-1170 +++$+++              Are you -- are you -- the -- the argument --             There is a brief from the Kansas law professors, and this is the instruction from the Kleypas case?             If the aggravators are not outweighed by the mitigators, you shall impose the death penalty, not that you may, not that you can, but that you shall impose the death penalty.                       This is the duty you were sworn to uphold.                    Shows command.     It means must.              That's -- is that the type of instruction --         -- the type of argument?
04-1186 +++$+++               No.   The question is why would Congress -- let's assume we have a choice between two readings.             Why would Congress want to give the State courts -- the State banks -- State banks -- greater access to Federal courts than it gives national banks?        What earthly reason would there be for Congress wanting to do that?           But not with every State with which it has a close nexus.           So, in other words, the partnership -- we have a corporation where it's incorporated and Congress said a principal place of business.          We have a partnership where each partner is located.         I don't know of any instance where for subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system you go to, as distinguished from personal jurisdiction or venue, you have a notion that someone is a citizen of every place where it does the business. Is there -- is there any other example?             It's certainly not true of a partnership.                    It isn't true of -- of a corporation.          Is there any other entity that would, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes --          Its members.          Yes, but the question that I asked you is, in the realm of subject matter jurisdiction, that is, which court system, Federal or State, as distinguished from where can I grab this person for personal jurisdiction purposes, what are my venue choices, is there any other example in all of title 28 where, for subject matter jurisdiction purposes, this -- every place where it's located counts?               In South Carolina.     It's not -- it's not as though you're being sent to some other place.              The only question is whether they would have access to the Federal court.                     But as far as personal jurisdiction is concerned, you have it in South Carolina.          But it would still be in South Carolina.
04-1203 +++$+++           Have Courts of Appeals approved those determinations?           And how many has it -- in the District Courts, how many have been rejected when it's something like television or recreation?           Well, before you do --           -- as I understand it, and as the Solicitor General confirmed, you are subject to the Rehabilitation Act, where the substantive scope is the same.          So, what -- you are saying, in the prison context, this is undue, but you all -- you are already subject to it under one Act.               And how has that been working out?          But maybe in the prison setting, the lower courts would pay some attention to the Court's recent decision in Cutter against Wilkinson, where the Court made it very clear that a high level of deference -- even dealing with a strict- scrutiny standard for religious freedom -- that a high level of deference would be paid to prison administrators' judgment of what safety and discipline requires inside a prison.            Wouldn't that -- wouldn't that carry over to the ADA, were it to apply?          Do you think that the --          -- that if the prison explained what their practices were, in terms of the needs of security, that a lower court will then say, "Well, never mind that.           The Supreme Court just said it.      We don't have to enforce it"?             I don't think there would be that kind of lawlessness.           It's interesting --           -- that you cite that case, in terms of Justice Scalia's remark, "Watch what we do, not what we say."             Cleburne was a remarkable case in that respect.           It purported to apply rational- basis review, but the plaintiffs won.           But if you think --           -- if you think of the -- any conceivable basis -- doesn't even have to be offered if the -- if it's, indeed, the rational-basis test.       It has been suggested that something more is going on in Cleburne, and, I think, in all candor, one would have to say so.            Because if you looked at the rational-basis test that had gone before, this one looked no better, no worse.           Can we go back, Mr. Castanias, to Justice Scalia's question about the core concerns?          And we have been told by Respondents that their core concerns are sanitation, mobility, protection from physical injury.                 Now, that sounds to me like constitutional Eighth Amendment heartland.
04-1244 +++$+++           Mr. Chemerinsky, if we turn from what this Court did, or did not, think about last time around to what those four counts were, would I look to find out what were those four acts of violence that remain in the case?           I could not find, in any of the papers before us, any specific definition of what those acts of violence were.            I mean, the jury was given -- I don't know what -- was it a dozen possibilities?                 And they found four.           But which four, we have no idea.         But he -- but wasn't this tried to a jury?          That was a jury that made those findings.         And the jury is no longer sitting.         He knows that there were four acts.       He knows that he -- under his instructions, the jury could pick 12.          How could he know which four the jury homed in on?         But does it -- when what turns on that finding is injunctive relief, the judge might very well be influenced by what those particular acts were.          He might say one set of four was not adequate to issue this injunction, but another set of four would be.      And we just don't know -- we don't know what those acts were.          The jury is not to be called back.        The Seventh Circuit said "no more evidence."                So, if we get down to those four acts, how can we say those are sufficient to uphold an injunction, when we don't even know what the acts were?        But the Seventh Circuit in its most recent expression said, "It may well be that the judge will decide that those 4 predicate acts" -- as opposed to 121 going in, 4 -- "were not sufficient to support certainly a nationwide injunction, but perhaps not any injunction."             Mr. Chemerinsky, the problem that I have, and Justice Breyer expressed, is, we have the reviser's notes that suggest, "I was just getting rid of extra words.              I was making this a tighter provision."           And there's not anything to indicate that Congress considered any change in the substance of the Act.             But here's a -- the reviser telling us, "I did this, and I did this to clean up the Act, to make it less wordy."           As you read it, can a private party get a preliminary injunction?        So, a private party could get an -- not only permanent, but preliminary --        -- injunction.        They made the assumption that this Court has an obligation to reason why, and there was no reason why given as to those four counts.
04-1264 +++$+++           Mr. Bland.          Mr. Bland, some State may say fraud in the inducement is void.                   These -- these are classifications that States make.                   These are labels that the State puts on them.              And you are introducing vast disuniformity if you say that the line to draw is between void and voidable.             You are forced into that because the Prima Paint case dealt with voidable.                      So you -- that you -- you are drawing a line between void and voidable which shifts from State to State.               But if you open the door -- if you open the door -- public policy has been called an unruly horse.                All you have to do is open the door and you will have litigation in court, and then the court will decide what the arbitrator would other -- otherwise decide.          You re giving the end result.        How many cases have the lawyers gone into court and said, court, strike down this contract because it s against public policy?                    Courts may reject many of those, but --              If we take --              -- if we take, Mr. Bland, what you said so -- the words transaction involving commerce, but a contract -- okay.                    So you spoke about void contracts.            Well, what about there s not enough consideration, things that go to the formation?                    So this contract was never formed.                   So --              So we re going far -- far beyond a void subject matter like usury.                   But you could say there -- there wasn t sufficient consideration. There was no mutuality or things that go to the formation of a contract.          Are you saying then if this case, the case that was brought in Florida, had been brought or removed in -- more likely removed because there was diversity, removed to the Federal court, the Federal court should do just what the Florida Supreme Court did?             Or would the Federal court say, well, we ve got our instructions from Prima Paint? It says excise the arbitration clause.               If that s okay, we decide the other questions.             You said this was an issue for the court.            Was there an alternate forum in that case?       Was it an arbitration case?
04-1324 +++$+++           Yes, but, Mr. Kise, the - - Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the following paragraph, and it is the sentence, "A Federal Court that sits in collateral review of a criminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation to enforce the Federal statute of limitations." That's the sentence that suggests that the Court of Appeals thought that there was an obligation, the District Court, to raise the statute of limitations on its own motion.             Would you say it's --             -- means it's "hardly ever"?       I mean, we do follow the principle of party presentation.            And judges are not supposed to be intruding issues on their own, they are supposed to follow the party's presentation.                    So, would this be -- if it's not "never," would it be at least "hardly ever," that it's appropriate for a judge to interject an affirmative defense on his own motion?          I thought in Granberry the Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion, since it hadn't -- the point had been missed in the District Court, been missed by everybody, until the Court of Appeals.         But why would --         -- why would you deal with that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in all fairness, said, "We join the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the District Court may review the timeliness of the 2254."       That's what -- the question that the court thought it was deciding.             Not generally.     Statute of limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c) affirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for the party to waive or not, just like the statute of limitations.            I don't think there's any rule that says a judge in the run-of-the-mine case acts properly by interjecting preclusion into a case where no party has raised it.
04-1327 +++$+++           Could you use --          Could -- could you use the same rule with respect to alibi evidence?                The trial judge would say this evidence for the prosecution is so strong, I'm not going to let any alibi evidence in.                   Is there -- is there anything special about third party guilt?       Couldn't -- couldn't you use -- use it for other defenses?         Can we -- can we just back up to Cabrera?         The D.C. Circuit did not publish that and --         -- and unless the rule has changed, it didn't have -- it didn't have any precedential effect -- those opinions that they did not put in the Federal Reports.         On that, could a prosecutor have gotten this case -- gotten an indictment against White on the basis that he had four witnesses who put him in the proximity of the crime, four who said that they heard him confess?               On the basis of that evidence, could White have been indicted for this?              And -- and also throw in one more thing, the victim's description of the assailant.             So if -- if White could have been indicted for this crime and -- and yet the jury is not allowed to hear that evidence, that sounds passing strange to me.         I don't --         You said it was enough to indict and that very same evidence is put before the jury, but it wouldn't be enough to convict?
04-1329 +++$+++            But why can Congress --           May I just ask your point on that?         You are giving -- your main argument is there are good reasons to retain this presumption.                 But then you said even if there aren't, leave it to Congress. The Court created this rule, the market power rule, not Congress.         Why, when we're dealing with a Court-created rule, should we say, well, the Court has had it in play for 60 years, so it's the legislature's job to fix it up, instead of the Court correcting its own erroneous way?
04-1332 +++$+++           Well, not -- there -- there are exceptions to the statute of limitations. You could have tolling, and there are exceptions to a preclusion doctrine.          So those doctrines aren't complete in the sense that they are without exceptions.               Well, you would at the end of the road.              If -- if you go to the Bivens claim and if the plaintiffs prevail, you could still appeal from that and say that that suit was barred.                        It should never have gone forward.               There's no question that it would be -- it doesn't die if you don't have an interlocutory review.              It's there but you've wasted a lot of time going through the whole trial to find out the answer.              The district judge said I'm not going to give you 1292(b) certification, but -- but there's Cohen against Beneficial out there.                        Why don't you try that route?                It was the district judge who -- who mentioned that possibility, wasn't it?          But I think the district -- the district judge was aware of Cohen against Beneficial, and I think referred to it.                   Maybe I'm -- I don't remember correctly.          No, but he mentioned that there was -- he mentioned Cohen.          Perhaps you should go on now to the question, assuming that it is immediately appealable.          But we -- this case is about the interpretation of 2676, as we took it.                    And before your time runs out, if we can get to the nub of your difference, your reading and the Government's, you say judgment in 2676 means judgment on the merits, and the Government says it means any judgment.                  So to buy your interpretation, we would have to put a caret mark after judgment and put on the merits.                  But the statute doesn't say on the merits.           A Bivens suit is pretty hard to prove, a lot harder than proving a case of negligence.

04-1360 +++$+++             What is the experience in Michigan?           The Michigan Supreme Court has had this rule for some time, that you don't exclude the evidence.            How many successful 1983 actions have there been --            But you have not even one case that you can cite where a 1983 remedy was resorted to and was successful.            But you're not aware of any case --         -- where anyone has recovered --         On the no-knock warrant, do you agree that it's not possible to get one in Michigan?          Then your --          -- position is that you never -- if you have a warrant, then you can seize what the warrant lists.            So, if you have a warrant, then there is never a reason that the police would have to knock and announce, because the warrant gives them independent authority to enter.                  That seems to be what you're saying, that as long as you have a warrant, there -- the knock-and-announce does not have to be complied with.
04-1371 +++$+++          Before --         -- you get to that, just -- Mr. Frederick, the logic of it -- but -- here, Congress is tightening the requirements for class actions, but then there is this class, which -- Blue Chip did say there's a lot -- room for a lot of abuse in holder classes -- would be left to the State courts for whatever strict or lenient rules.       So, why would Congress, with respect to this category, want there to be a more plaintiff-friendly rule than the rule that Congress has just put in place for the purchaser/seller 10(b) actions?           Well, at least in some States.           But you -- you're admitting that an -- that anomaly could be part of the scene, that you'd have a State that allows you to sue for negligence, and doesn't have heightened pleading requirements for holder claims; and so, those claims would be treated more -- in a more plaintiff-friendly way than Federal claims.         Before you finish -- there's two questions I would like to ask him.               One is -- we know about the holder claims.           They are saved for State actions.        They're not preempted.         What else would fall in this category that is not -- that SLUSA doesn't affect, that can be brought as class actions in State court?               You --
04-1376 +++$+++         In the instance --        -- of a child --        -- who had -- he had a relationship to a child in the United States.                And couldn't that have counted for suspension of deportation or removal, whatever terms I use now?                  Did --        -- for a hardship claim, a parent-child relationship?        He was here -- he was here for 20 --        -- 20 years, though.        Is it --        Is it farfetched, in view of the history of now I- -- before INS, weren't there a great many people who got here and -- just as this Petitioner -- who just lived here for years and years, and were never disturbed?
04-1414 +++$+++             Mr. Reichel, one of the concerns about the position you're taking, the alternative would be that the police officer, expecting that this package is going to be delivered at a certain time, is on the lookout for it.                 He sees the post officer approaching, calls on his cell phone to get an emergency warrant, let's say.                 The magistrate will not be nearly as well informed as he was when he was presented with -- was it a 64-paragraph affidavit?                     So the magistrate knows that the whole deal -- he can't possibly know it if he's got -- got a telephone call on an urgent basis.           So if you want the magistrate's judgment rather than the police officers' on the spot, then it makes much more sense to have the magistrate get a detailed picture of what's going on and decide whether or not he'll issue the warrant.           But I just -- I made the opposite argument, that a telephone warrant has to be done on the basis of minimum information.                The officer -- the magistrate will have a detailed affidavit when it isn't on an emergency basis.                He -- he will have, as he did in this case, an affidavit with 64 paragraphs explaining the whole deal, how it was set up.                So isn't -- isn't there greater security if you could have a magistrate with time to think, well, is there really probable cause than to have the magistrate make that judgment on a -- such a quick basis?           So there has to be -- when does he get the -- when does the magistrate get the affidavit?            Where -- where is time?         I know that the Fourth Amendment says persons and places. Where does it say time is one of the particulars?               I think time -- time is certainly relevant to probable cause, but the -- the Fourth Amendment says what you have to identify with particularity are places and the items and the person. Person, things, and place.                   It doesn't say time, but you say that's inherent.                 Have we -- are there decisions of this Court that say time goes to the particularity requirement?         They have first the outer limit of the 10 days in the warrant itself.                     And in fact, this warrant was executed within 2 days of its issuance.         Is that not --           And could it be if the officer knows that this package -- let's say it's loaded with dynamite or guns or drugs -- is going to be delivered at a certain time and it -- the delivery occurs, and then the officer busts in and says, there's exigent circumstances.              They're going to take those drugs and they'll be off the premises.                    That might happen.           Well, my -- my question is, isn't it better to have the police go to the magistrate when there's time for the magistrate to reflect, than to have this scenario where the police will say this was really dangerous stuff, exigent circumstances?           Wouldn't you want the officer to apply in advance for the warrant?        Even -- wasn't this man -- magistrate told we've set this whole thing up?                    We've put this package in the mail.              It's going to be delivered at such and such a time.                 Wasn't the magistrate told that?        So why was there a need for a second call when exactly that happened?        Didn't -- was -- he was on the premises?           And he said, I know why they're here.
04-1477 +++$+++               Including -- including Arkansas.         Didn't Arkansas change its law so now it requires if you -- if it's unclaimed, they have to do personal service?              This taxpayer, though --              This taxpayer -- even though he failed to give notice of his current address, this taxpayer would be entitled under the current statute to personal service.          I thought he still lived in --          I thought he still lived in Arkansas.          Homestead.          I see.          Right.          Suppose -- suppose we had a case where the homeowner has kept the Lands Commissioner informed of her current address, does everything she was supposed to do except at the time this notice, certified mail notice -- at the time of the delivery attempt, she's hospitalized having a quadruple bypass, so she never gets it.                 And then what -- what are the consequences of that?          But Mullane, as Mr. Kirkpatrick pointed out, involved masses of people. This was a common trust fund, and the reliance was on that a goodly number of them would get notice and they were kind of stand-ins for the ones who didn't.                 But here, we're dealing with a single individual.

Weren't they entitled to have notice that there was a settlement and that the case was going to be dismissed?        The plaintiff had -- had no obligation to notify the State?                 There was some mention of a -- of a obligation to cooperate.                Is there any statutory obligation under -- I don't see it in the Medicaid statute, but under Arkansas law for -- for the Medicaid recipient to cooperate with the State?        Do you still have a declaration that the Arkansas statute was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the Federal statute?

04-1528 +++$+++            Was there any testimony or evidence on the other side of the point that Judge Winter makes?           That is, you have someone running in a primary and then faces an incumbent in the general election, but there's nothing left in the till because it was a hard-fought primary.                 That -- the advantage to the incumbent in that situation was a large concern to at least some of the judges on the Second Circuit.           Not on the contributions, is it?
04-1544 +++$+++           Why should it?      The probate exception is court-created.                   Congress passed no law that said it.         Congress gave the Federal courts jurisdiction in certain categories of cases and expected them to exercise that jurisdiction.                   Since our jurisdiction is statutory and the probate exception was made up by the courts, shouldn't we interpret it as narrowly as possible, perhaps even do away with it because it lacks any statutory basis?             You're arguing a preclusion question, and if the Ninth Circuit thought it had jurisdiction, it could have tested what you say about Texas law.        There's no finding in this record of what Texas law is other than what you have just told us, and perhaps you're right and perhaps you're not. But the Ninth Circuit said the Federal door is closed to this probate exception, and that's what we're here to decide.          I think it -- it may be that there's another side to that story.                 For example, I think the bankruptcy court was heard from first. Arguably, that's binding on the Texas court.                  Whether the bankruptcy court was right or wrong, it would get full faith and credit.           That's one argument. Another is perhaps you can explain to me how this all started because I thought that it was a claim made against her in the bankruptcy court for defamation.            Then the claim that she asserts is a compulsory counterclaim.               She has to make it there or she'll lose it.            I -- I didn't understand the pleading to say if I have a claim, it would be nondischargeable.            I thought he made a claim.        He made -- filed a claim for defamation in the bankruptcy proceeding.          He would have to say I have a claim because the bankruptcy court is not going to decide a hypothetical if he has a claim.                He has to at least assert I have a claim.          It has to be a real claim. It can't be if I have a claim.           You -- you are suggesting an extraordinary setup with a State court being able to preclude other courts from dealing with related, not identical matters, and that's just not the way our system works.          You can bring duplicative proceedings in different courts.          One will finish first and that will bind the others.          But I -- I never heard of a State court being able to say, because we are a probate court, that you -- you couldn't bring a tort case someplace else.          That's the definition of an in rem judgment, but she's suing for an in personam judgment an individual, not an estate, just for a plain old money judgment.

04-1618 +++$+++            Who pays judgments?   Who pays judgments against the county?           I thought that was one of the main indicia of whether an entity had been set up as an arm of the State, that is, the State would be directly liable.          To what -- what other area would this apply?           If the county has sovereign immunity, how about the county school board?           And education would not --           How about the sanitation department?           What about the South Carolina Supreme Court's opinion in the Hines case which seems to run counter to your argument?           The -- the Eleventh Circuit had a prior decision, didn't they?
04-1704 +++$+++         Is there any --        Is there any authority at all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or controversy requirement?            I mean, it's one thing to say you can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's a case or controversy.           I'm -- I don't know of any authority that says that you can -- you can take a matter that is not a constitutional case or controversy and latch it onto something that does qualify.        I think it was pointed out that, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the same spending on the part of the Federal Government. Here, you have apples and oranges.                 The property tax is quite discrete from the investment tax credit.          -- I don't understand why that's an example of a loose standing connection.                       I mean, she surely had an -- a pocketbook injury.                 True, she was complaining about a denial of equal protection to the fraternity brothers, but that she had an injury, in fact, there was no doubt.         There was no lack of standing below.          The problem was that the -- Craig turned 21 while the case was pending in this Court. There was standing below.             He was 18 when the litigation started.        In any event, they were attacking the same thing.            So, your case is different, at least to that extent, that you have two discrete taxes.
04-1739 +++$+++           So let's say if -- if the flaw is it doesn't deter other people because they don't know about it, then if they -- if they broadcast it all over so everyone knows about it, then it's okay?        I thought you were using that to say that the security concern doesn't hold up because of the papers that they're allowed to have in their cells can be used similarly for fires, similarly to do other bad things.        So I thought that's why you were using that, just to say that the -- the security concern is dubious because the materials that they are allowed to have in their cells can -- could achieve exactly the same end.        What -- this --        What other than the periodical, newspaper access differentiates this custody from the next higher --        Yes.
04-373 +++$+++              Mr. Ravenell --             -- you are defending a judgment that no court in Maryland, as far as I know, ever made.                   All of the courts thought that the law was, yes, the taint of an improper question by the police can be removed.             So, let's take the case as it comes to us.             The taint can be removed.    That is the law.             Accepting that to be the law, what, in your judgment, would it take to remove the taint?                    -- the taint here being the statement that Office Reese made.       I --       -- I think -- tell me if I'm wrong about this particular record.              I thought that the trial judge put it rather simply.            He said, "There was an interrogation by a police officer named Reese."       That's conceded, as I understand it from Maryland --         -- that the police asked the question, and then the trial judge said the -- what Blake said was an answer to that question.         That's how she read what happened.         There was a question implying, "You'd better speak to us," and there was an answer to that question.        Not an initiation.         That's --         -- that's what we're --         -- we're dealing with in this case.
04-433 +++$+++           Are you for relaying -- relating the position of the United States -- are you relying on that brief in the Bank of China case that was filed --          Which -- which was kind of said in passing to say that there was no -- that the -- that the court below was right and we shouldn't take the case.               Being -- is there any other case where the defendant is charged with not paying tax either to the Federal Government or the State?       Now you have it both because you --               -- you said they haven't paid tax for this -- their income -- Federal income tax either. This seems to be a novel claim, and I don't know of another where failure to pay tax owed to a State or the Federal Government is the basis for a RICO claim.           You're getting away from --         Can we go back to the question that I was trying to ask you before with relation to the novelty of this because it involves fraud on the -- a government that's a tax assessor and collector?          It seems to me that the taxing authorities, both State and Federal, might have some genuine concern with a potential plaintiff's examining to see, gee, has my -- has my rival, my competitor cheated on his or her tax.      That -- that could be pretty disruptive of the State or the Federal Government's administering their tax systems.        But I wasn't concerned about that problem.         I was concerned about people setting themselves up as private enforcers of tax liability as kind of a surrogate for the government out there detecting who's violated the tax laws.           How about your client's supplier?         If your client -- if Ideal is selling less, then it's going to buy less from its supplier.                   So would the supplier also have a RICO claim?            What -- what is New York relying?         I mean, they -- somebody -- does -- does the State or the Federal taxpayer rely on everybody who files a return that they -- they filed it honestly?                      Is that -- that -- I don't understand the sense in which a taxing authority relies on the return that's been filed.
04-473 +++$+++           Ms. Lee -- Ms. Lee told us that the Ninth Circuit weighed the capacity of the plaintiff as an employee, rather than a member of the public, in favor of the employee and against the employer. Is that how you read the Ninth Circuit's decision?         But that would be something that would have to go to trial, to prove that the -- that the employee was incompetent.             But then he would be violating the internal rules of the workplace.             Where as giving his candid views -- the search warrant -- he's giving his own opinion.        But if he goes outside, he is violating a rule of the workplace.              And it would seem to me that there are certainly measures could be taken against him for that.           I thought that's --           -- what Connick was about, that there are things that are said in the workplace that are of no public interest.               They're personal gripes.             Well, you -- it wouldn't be that way if the rule was that if it's employee speech on the job, it's not protected at all.             No, that's the argument that's being made here by both the --            There's one aspect of this case that no one has touched on.                   The concurring judge, Judge O'Scannlain, said, this is what whistleblower statutes are supposed to handle, and that if we accepted your view of the first-amendment coverage, the whistleblower statutes would be superfluous.            California does have a whistleblower statute.              Is that right?            And there was a claim made under it, but we're not told how it came out.            There was not.         He did -- he --         Some are quite narrow --         -- of what they cover.         Some of the whistleblower statutes are very specific and narrow --         -- of what they cover.
04-52 +++$+++              Why?              What was the -- on the -- on the eye-roll, which I thought also the -- the prosecutor said that she turned her head.                   So it may be that she was out of the vision of the -- the judge even if he had been looking.                  I don t see that you have any evidence to rebut it.                You said, well, it was rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.                  There was no evidence.             There was no evidentiary hearing.           I thought there was another -- another.          Wasn t there another minority woman on the -- in the jury panel?               Well, she might in the future, if she s got a job as a prosecutor in this court.       So she s certainly going to be concerned with her reputation, her integrity before the court.          What s wrong with the explanation, as far as youth is concerned, is that she didn t want to across-the-board strike young people, but she just wanted to come up with a jury that had dominantly older people.            So that wouldn t mean that she s withdrawing youth.            It s just that she s saying it isn t an absolute with me.           Well, what s -- one -- one point could be I don t want too many young people, so I m going to exercise some peremptories to make sure that the jury is dominantly older people.                  What s wrong with that?           Well, she did.     Number 6 was white.          Right?           And youth was a factor there.       There may have been other factors, but youth was certainly a factor in that case.            But that -- that was so obviously a slip, and Judge Hall pointed that out in her dissent.             Defense counsel too confused -- was confused on the numbers.                Obviously, it -- the -- the prosecutor wasn t trying to say a grandmother is going to be excused -- is going to be struck because she s young.
04-593 +++$+++            It wouldn't just be an argument.         You'd have to amend your complaint because it wasn't set out in the complaint.        Was there any overlap? The -- what damages could the corporation JWM have collected under -- had it brought a 1981 suit?          But those contracts --               But you'd have to concede at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's gone too because those two claims were intimately related, and you would be precluded from bringing such a claim.         So to the extent that there's an overlap, you face a res judicata bar.           So they -- the Ninth Circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in this situation.          Both can sue and one gets -- the damages are not identical.              That's --           The shareholder can sue. The sole shareholder can sue.               The corporation can sue. Both have 1981 claims.           It's not either/or.           They both have 1981 claims, but the damages are different in the case of the individual than in the case of the corporation.            If it fits, it's because of some cases.           So -- because this whole area, 1981, didn't take off until Runyon against MCCrary.                     So we're starting with what?           1976.      So to -- to flesh out what that claim is, you must be relying on some decisions of this Court when you talk about dignitary damages.            But I thought that didn't go into anything.          That was a two-page per curiam, and it was just was there a claim.                 And it didn't --            I thought that that was about does the -- does the act cover religion or -- or does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race, or does anti-semitism count as race.                     I thought that's what was all that was decided.           Well, I don't see anything in the opinion about -- I just see the issue before the Court was does this come under the heading race.

Because one of the things that Unitherm said about that argument -- which, as you prefaced, is not before us -- is, the Court of Appeals was looking to a truncated record to see whether there was sufficient evidence that, in fact, the record was much larger than the piece of it that the Federal Circuit examined, so that the Federal Circuit, when it says there was no evidence, was looking to the appendix that was before us, but that was not the whole picture.         But under this Federal Circuit's own law, it could not be, because there had not been the post-verdict motion.         The Federal Circuit is borrowing Tenth Circuit's law for this purpose, but the Tenth Circuit's law, as I understand it, has -- is the position that was just presented to us by Mr. Stewart. That is, if you don't make what used to be called the JNOV, even if you made the directed verdict, you can't raise the sufficiency on appeal.         Isn't --         -- that the Federal Circuit's own rule?         It -- it was, I thought, pretty clear what it told us in that footnote, that if we were ruling -- making the ruling -- the Federal Circuit law is, if you don't make the 50(b) motion, you cannot get a reversal on appeal for insufficient evidence.         Borrow --         -- the Tenth Circuit rule.         Yes.    But that's -- in respect to the Chief Justice's question, the -- Unitherm could have thought, "Well, the Federal Circuit is not going to deal with sufficiency; therefore, I don't have to beef up" --         -- "what I put in the appendix."         I'm looking at the motion that you made, which was not in the first instance for a new trial; it was for a remittitur.                 This is on page 34(a) of the joint appendix.           And you made a motion, in the alternative, for a new trial on antitrust damages, not liability.          So, I was really struck by the statement in your brief that you had, indeed, made a motion for a new trial.       You made it a motion for a remittitur and, in the alternative, a new trial, limited to damages.                 You said nothing about a new trial on liability.         A new trial on damages -- that's all you asked for -- not a new trial on liability.         It --         -- it was -- the new trial request had to do with liability --         -- whether it was for newly discovered evidence or something else.                   But you -- your motion was limited to damages.                And I really don't think that you can get where you want to go from a motion that is limited to damages, when you didn't need to.                   You could have made a motion for a new trial on the whole case.         The principal point was that the Court of Appeals could not enter -- direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law if a 50(b) motion had not been made.          That's what those three cases --         -- invoke.         How about a --         Well, it can't -- it can't be -- it would be interlocutory at that stage.                  It couldn't be raised until final judgment is entered.          Yes, but you don't go up on appeal with a final judgment rule, a firm final judgment rule, as there is in the Federal system, from the denial or refusal to act on a 50(a) motion.          The trial isn't over.   There is no judgment.           You can't appeal til you have a final judgment.          Well, there is, you know -- I mean, this truly is a case where a page of history is worth much more than logic.               The reason for that somewhat strange language is, at common law, it was thought, once the jury came in with a verdict, that was it, the judge had no power to overturn it, because of the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause, "no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of common law." And the rule of common law that is embodied in this somewhat strange language in Rule 50 is that there could be a reserved question so that after the jury comes in with the verdict, the judge would be deciding the pre- verdict question by this post-verdict motion.              I mean, there's -- none of this is in doubt, where this language in 50 comes from.          It comes from a need to adjust to the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amendment.              Isn't that so?         But you don't get it out of that language, because that language is there for the specific purposes of allowing a judge, after their verdict, to enter judgment NOV.         He doesn't enter judgment to trigger the 50(b) motion.             The 50(b) motion is made in between the verdict and the entry of judgment.         Right.         But I don't --         -- I don't follow that, because you -- you know, I'm sure, that it's almost routine that -- yes, you have the 10 days, the extra 10 days, under the rules -- but isn't it almost routine, at a trial, that the verdict loser will say, "Judge, please give me JNOV, or, if not, a new trial"?                  They don't wait til after the judgment is made -- entered.                 They could. But it's just -- well, in the trials I've seen, it's almost by rote that lawyers who lose, where the jury comes in for the other side, will renew the judgment-as-a- matter-of-law motion and ask, in the alternative, for a new trial.          Isn't that the common practice?         Well, it's not a question of what is required or what is permissive, but isn't it to the lawyer's advantage, to the client's advantage, to say to the judge, sooner rather than later, "Look don't enter judgment.         Give me -- give me judgment NOV or at least a new trial"?         Sent back to -- for a new trial because the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial, or sent back to the trial court for that court to decide as a matter of that court's discretion, whether to order --         -- a new trial?       The latter.         But it --         -- it was not -- but, here, you're asking us to affirm something that a Court of Appeals did.

04-623 +++$+++                Raise it up.        But you agree -- you -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question, he mentioned a drug that was a schedule 1 drug, morphine.                  Or maybe --         -- perhaps it isn't --        It's schedule 2 drug.        But are you saying that if the doctor is using it, saying, "In my medical judgment, this makes people happy; and, therefore, I'm going to prescribe it," that a State could permit that?                  Wouldn't the Moore case rule that out?         But I thought the idea of Moore was, if you're using this, the doctor is prescribing the drug as a pusher.           May I ask you, in -- Mr. Atkinson, in response to the question you were just asked, you said there were procedural problems, no notice in comment.         So, that's a "how" it's done.           How about the "who"?    Is this something -- how does it work under the Controlled Substance Act?            What authority does the Department of HHS have?       What is the division of authority between those two under the Act?            The Attorney General, on the one hand, and the Department of Health and Human Services, and including the FDA, on the other.           But you made --           -- you made a point earlier that the Attorney General has never done this before, has never said, "You can't prescribe particular drugs for" -- has -- that has not been done.               You've been giving examples of where the FDA ruled that you can't --          -- use a drug.   And that control is nationwide, no matter what the State medical board thinks, right?          Who -- the consultation, you said, was not with HHS, and it wasn't with Oregon?                 Who did the Attorney General consult?

04-698 +++$+++                As I understand it --         Before we -- you go onto the argument, your answer to Justice O'Connor, if I remember the facts correctly, wasn't quite right.                 This child was in private school for years, and the parents weren't asking anybody to do anything, because -- and it's only when the private school said, "We have to -- we can no longer put up with your child.               Your child has all these problems" -- at that time, the parents then came to the school district and asked for an IEP.         Which the parents didn't think was acceptable and, in the interim, placed the child in another private school.              But it was not a case that they put the child in a private school first, and then sought reimbursement.         I thought --         Mr. Garre, do you have any numbers, overall, how -- of the incidence of the parents going to the administrative hearing first, as opposed to the school district?             Isn't it overwhelming that, in these proceedings, the parents are the one -- ones who initiate the hearing?           Now we go back to the -- an answer you gave before, when we were going through what, in fact, happened, the suggestion that maybe the parents were just trying to get the private-school tuition reimbursed, the -- there was a finding, wasn't there, in the District Court, in the -- this is in the Petitioner's appendix, at 46 and 47 -- the district court said, "The parents in no way prevented the IEP from being formulated or otherwise failed, in good faith, to consider it."         It's not hypothetical.          Isn't it -- it isn't hypothetical.              States -- isn't it true that some States have said that, in these hearings, the school district will have the burden of proof?         Mr. Garre, if you -- if you had a situation, say, under Title 7 -- and you pointed out in your brief that, in most benefit cases, most -- the person -- whether it's Social Security -- the person who is making the claim has the burden of proof.                  But there is something different about this setup, because the statute does obligate the school district to come up with a plan. And so, I was thinking, if you have a Title 7 case, and the plaintiff prevails on the merits, and then there's a question of remedy, and the employer said, "I propose this -- these changes to remedy the violation," wouldn't the employer in that case have the burden of establishing the adequacy of the plan that it has come up with to remedy the problem?         No, you made --         -- that determination has been made --          -- that the -- that there has been a violation.         And then the question is, What remedy? And the employer proposes a remedy.                    Wouldn't the employer have the burden of showing the adequacy of the remedy that the employer --             Is there any --             Now we have a number of States that do put the burden on the school district.                       Is there any indication that the cost is higher in those States than in States that put the burden on the parents?         And do you have --         -- do you have any information in -- to the question I asked earlier -- in the States that have said, "School district, you bear the burden," do we know whether there's more litigation?                   Do we know whether there has been a notable increase in the costs in those States that have placed the burden on the school districts?
04-712 +++$+++           Then why did you name it, in the complaint, as the defendant?          Then you'll be left without        -- if you've named the wrong defendant, then you have a suit against no defendant.                 It seems to me you are automatically dismissed.                 You didn't substitute another defendant.               And how about joint appendix 239 and 275, both of which say that Franzen was not a partner in any entity responsible for managing the apartments in question?          Then there's no defendant.            But you named Lincoln as the defendant.           And I'm looking at your second amended complaint, which says, "Lincoln," on information and belief, "is a corporation with its headquarters in Dallas, and it is the developer and manager of the property."                That's what you alleged in your complaint.            You allege that Lincoln was the manager -- Lincoln, whose Texas corporation was the manager of the property in question.                       Now, would you -- you're saying that that was wrong, and you should have sued somebody else, and the Court should cure that for you?             That's -- it's really bizarre.          But they -- let me stop you on that "real party," because, as has been pointed out, the "real party in interest" concept, as a procedural matter, comes out of rule 17, and it's talking about plaintiffs, that suits have to be brought in the name of the real party so that the defendant isn't in a situation where he's sued one day by plaintiff A, and is not home free when plaintiff B comes in with the identical complaint. So, it was originally designed with, Who is the proper party, the assignee or the assignor?                    That's what real party -- that's what the concept is familiarly about.         Who is the proper plaintiff, not defendant?          Rule 17 is about joinder of parties; it's not about jurisdiction.          So, that's -- it's something different.           It's a -- it's a whole other animal, because "real party in interest," as used in the Federal rules, is a device -- is a joinder device, is in the joinder rules.                Now you're saying, "Ah, but there's some other real-party concept out there that has to do with jurisdiction."          I thought Carden was about: In a partnership, does every partner's citizenship count?               There wasn't any question that -- that it was the right or the -- that the defendant was a wrong defendant or that --          But we don't know --          -- who that party is. Let's go back to your -- when you started this case, you said that you would, on discovery -- this is what you said in -- at the time of your initial complaint -- determine if there is an additional defendant, or defendants, who should be named as parties.         What discovery did you pursue to find out if there was an additional defendant, or defendants, who should be named as parties?              Mr. Joseph, do I take it that the essence of your position is that a removing defendant, if that removing party is a corporation, must disclose all affiliates that may have been involved in the -- in the occurrence that the plaintiff might have, but failed, to name as a defendant, that a defendant -- although, on the surface, there's complete diversity, a defendant corporation must, in order to remove, identify all subsidiaries and affiliates who might have been sued, as well?          But defendant never took the position, "Not me."          Defendant said --          -- "Yes, we are the responsible party."          Yes, but I also --          -- pointed out it's --

Did this -- did Mr. Olson collect, under the State workers' compensation statute, from the mine operators?         But the -- but the mine operator -- the Compensation Act is the exclusive remedy under Arizona law, so the -- nobody could get anything more from the mine operator.               Is that so?         Aren't there, in all kinds of situations, private inspectors?               One of them that was mentioned in the briefs, I think, is an elevator operator.         Elevator operation inspector. So, there's lots of private inspectors.                There may not be private mine inspectors.            I don't know about that.       But this would be inspector liability.         But you said the district court went off on discretionary function?
04-805 +++$+++             Citizens -- Citizens Publishing did not have a joint venture that had advance approval from the FTC.                 It had --            And I think that makes a big difference.          I mean, the FTC blessed this and said it was okay.           They asked for certain adjustments. Those were made.          One of them was not, that you had to maintain a differential in the price between Texaco and Shell.            But the FTC, which is the expert agency, said we don't think this joint venture is an antitrust violation.             Don't we owe some respect to that determination, which was absent in Citizens Publishing?          May I ask a very naive question?         Is -- this is basically the same commodity, gasoline.         They have different attitude -- additives, but basically costs the same.                Facilities to produce it are the same.          Why should they -- should there be from -- now that they're marketing this under one joint venture, why should they make a difference in the price of what is basically the same commodity?          Well, what difference physically is there other than they have different additive -- additives?          One of the briefs said that the reason for that price hike was that there was an explosion in a refinery in California and outages in others and that there was a market-wide price increase. That was in --         So is the answer -- in -- in case the Court does not agree with you, can you then say, I would like to resurrect rule of reason or do you agree with your adversary that -- that that's out of the case because you forfeited it?              The ordinary, routine rule of reason you have waived.                   Is that so?

And, by the way, I didn't notice that you refer to the Second Circuit decision in your brief. Did you?        It --        -- goes --        In the brief here -- well, it's -- it surprised me that there were those two cases. But, do you have any notion of how many slip-and-fall, trip-over-mail cases -- claims are filed?        You concede --        -- liability for a slippery fall in the Post Office.        Yes.        Well, there was --        -- there was, in one of the briefs, an example where there's a puddle created by the janitor.         The Post Office is liable.            It's -- relates to taking care of the building.              There's a parcel of mail that has a liquid in it, and it's dropped, and the puddle is created by the that.           No liability.          And you agree that that would be the result?        So, you agree --        -- that that hypothetical --        -- is correct?       And there's another one that they gave.             The letter carrier comes. He's got a mailbag filled with mail, dumps it on the street while he takes a rest, somebody trips over it. That's case one.          Case two is, he's finished making his rounds, and he dumps the sack on the street, it has no mail in it, and somebody trips over it.                 On your theory of the case, would there be liability in both situations or only in the one where the mailbag was stuffed full of mail?        Negligence --        Intentional --        -- torts aren't covered --        -- by it, are they?
04-881 +++$+++         But Mr. Wolfman tells us, Ms. Blatt, that this clause is not quite as sweeping as you suggest, the clause in the 1991 Act, and points specifically to provisions that say, "no other provision of law enacted before, on, or after."                   The picture we're given of the 1991 Act is that up until 1991, whatever exists up until 1991, there's no time limitation, but that this 1991 statute does not speak to subsequently enacted statutes.

04-885 +++$+++        In -- I don't follow that, because I thought the theory of the cases were that you can waive something by conduct.           And so, when you ask a court for relief against a party, then it's reasonable to say, "If you're coming in and asking the court to give you something, then it's only fair that your adversary should be able to" --       Let me ask this --       If you lose on the abrogation notion, and the Court holds that there is no authority in Congress to abrogate sovereign immunity, still the bankruptcy code codifies what is, across the board, the law.             That is, if you come to a court and say, "Give me X against D," that D should be able to come back and say, "Either I want full relief because it's a compulsory type counterclaim.             I have to bring it here.     I can't bring it separately.          Or at least a setoff."     I mean, that was understood, that a party over whom the court would not have jurisdiction otherwise, is amendable to the court's jurisdiction to the extent of a counterclaim or a setoff.      So, I don't see why (b) and (c) are not discrete from (a).     (b) and (c) are implementing the idea of a setoff.           You come to court for a claim, you are deemed to have waived any jurisdictional objection to the counterclaim or the setoff.            No.    No.       No.    Hood said --       -- that Congress could abrogate.        -- through the Bankruptcy Clause.

What is the basis, the specific basis, for that conclusion, that it occurred after the FBI tested the evidence?              Yes, but then there was also the evidence that was not disputed, that it was a dry day and that there was no mud at all at the scene of the crime.              I thought that was --              -- that it was agreed that there -- that the site where the body was found, that that was dry, that that was dry ground.                   I thought there was no dispute about that.         Well, as far as that's concerned, she did testify that there was a car out there.         And the rest of the story doesn't -- doesn't put the defendant House at the time of the crime in a car.           He's walking.            But they happened at the same time, didn't they?               The --            -- the child testified to what she heard, and I thought she heard a car and someone in a low voice, and then her mother left with that someone.          Isn't it --          What about at the sentencing stage?         Justice Kennedy brought it up.           The -- the prosecutor didn't emphasize unduly the semen at the -- at the guilt stage but, boy, made a big deal out of it at the sentencing stage.          Where was it in the -- in the joint appendix?           I thought it was more than kidnapping.          Said nothing about the semen --           -- at the -- at the sentencing stage?
04-905 +++$+++        Mr. Phillips, the problem that I have with even accepting your theory is what the other side calls the "mix and match" quality of your evidence.              That is, you say here's Reeder, disfavored, and here's someone else, favored.       But it's not consistently the same someone else.          And, for all we know, someone else could make a case saying, "We compare ourselves with Reeder, and we say, oh, there was that sale 7 months ago, where they got a whopping discount and we got a much smaller one."         You're not -- you don't have the same favored customer.         You're picking from a series of sales, and we don't know how manipulative this proof is.               And we I mean - and we don't --           But you did -- you did get a judgment on the -- whatever it was -- the State Franchises Act, and that is not being contested --           -- on appeal.       So that if -- the question is whether fair franchising practices -- were there unfair practices?        You won a verdict that there was a violation of the Fairness in Franchising Act.       Well, you won on it.       You won on it.      But the difference is that that doesn't give you treble damages.       On --       -- limitations, one of the aspects of this mismatches -- that in one case you went back as much as -- there was a 7-month differential.               Is there a timeframe, if we adopt your theory, about -- in which you can engage in this comparison?
04-928 +++$+++              And your --             -- response is that he wasn't there.            It's one thing to say, "It was intentional, but you didn't prove deliberate."                     The other thing is to say, "He wasn't there.                     He didn't commit the crime in the first place."                     Those are two quite different things.              Can you put it -- make it concrete for this case?               Because I don't see that there would be -- I mean, if the action is intentional, and the question was whether it was deliberate, what planning here would have gone on in some different timeframe?           I still don't -- I still don't understand.        You say that there was -- there had to be proof for conviction and guilt -- of guilt of intentional conduct.            And this is a simple story that's told: they wanted to go to one house, too many lights on in that house; they were frustrated, they wanted to go someplace else, so they came upon the aunt and uncle of the defendant's former girlfriend.             Whatever Oregon law might say, or not say, it appears that this Supreme -- Oregon Supreme Court was acting under what it thought was the compulsion of the eighth amendment.                       If it's wrong about that, you can make your argument about what Oregon law should be, without any eighth amendment constraint.             But it does seem that this court was operating on the assumption that the eighth amendment required it to let in this alibi and other evidence.
04-944 +++$+++           There was no -- there was no allegation that the plaintiff was employed by your client?          Do we have the complaint in --           Did it, in fact, come up in that posture in the case?                It has already been mentioned that the word jurisdiction has many, too many uses.       Did it -- did the question come up in the Indian tribe cases as it did here after the case was fully tried and after there was a jury verdict for the plaintiff?              When -- if -- if it's brought up promptly, it really doesn't matter, does it, whether you label it 12(b)(1) jurisdiction or 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim?                 It goes out either way. When it is consequential is when you bring it up, as you did here, after you lose on -- at the trial.            May I go back to Zipes? In Zipes, the Court was faced with the -- the word jurisdictional had been appended to the statute of limitations.           I think that was true of the way the EEOC spoke of the rigid time limit, that it was mandatory and jurisdictional.            And then the Court explained in Zipes that a strict time line doesn't mean that it's jurisdictional.           You can have a rule that's rigid, but it doesn't determine subject matter jurisdiction.                      And that's what Zipes tried to explain.                     The Court in Zipes was faced with a number of cases that had used that term to describe the time in which you must bring the action, mandatory and jurisdictional.              Yes, but now we know it's -- EEOC has changed.              But why -- now that we do have Zipes, why should the number of employees be treated any differently than that rigid time line in -- in Zipes?          But that was a pendant jurisdiction case.         Wasn't Aldinger --          Well, you just used an interesting word because there are litigants who can claim complete immunity from liability, but that immunity, whether it's absolute or qualified, doesn't go to the court's subject matter jurisdiction.                 It has to be raised in those cases as a defense.          Or leave it to the States that often do cover smaller shops.          It certainly matters for plaintiffs in this situation.              It certainly matters from the defendant's point of view too.                        In many of these cases, it's not clear whether the number 15 has been -- as in this case, you have delivery drivers.                       You have owners whose wives are employed in the business.              From the -- from the point of view of a defendant who thinks I'm going to fight this case on the merits, but if I lose, I still have this ace up my sleeve.           That sounds like a good reason why a court should think long and hard about categorizing this as a question of subject matter jurisdiction.           Well, it would be simultaneous.          The jury -- the jury would have that question.         Didn't I understand the attorney for the United States to say this is typical of what juries decide, was this person an independent contractor or an employee?
04-9728 +++$+++           Mr. Niver --          Well, are there manuals -- are there any -- here is the cop on the beat.          He sees someone that he knows is a parolee.           Is there any instruction that he's been given so that his discretion can be guided instead of rudderless?           In practice in California, are all --          Yes.     What is the practice?          I'm asking you about what instruction, what training, if you know, are officers given?       Or are they given no training, just the law that says, "You can search any parolee"?             What would be arbitrary and capricious?             You told us harassing would be the repeated searches by the same officer.        But all this is on a case -- would be on a case-by-case basis.                   There are no going-in guides for the officer on the street.               Mr. Long seemed to have -- tell us something different about that.                     It's -- they had -- they must go out.                 He seemed to say they didn't have the choice of staying in.        But it really --        -- it really isn't.        It's -- this is not like you sign an agreement and you're -- you can do it or you can not do it.        I mean, this is a real Hobson's choice, isn't it?        You can't --        -- negotiate, "I don't" --        -- "want this part."         Has --         -- the recidivism rate gone down in the years since the Reyes decision, since this is suspicionless search, as opposed to reasonable suspicion?
04-980 +++$+++           Are you saying -- because this can get pretty complex -- simply, that because special circumstances are a discreet category, that, in effect, what went -- what the court is instructing is double counting that factor?              It's a factor in all the circumstances how the -- how the crime was committed is a factor of all circumstances; and then, in addition, it is a special circumstance.           So it is, in effect, counted twice.        Is that the essence of your argument?          But isn't it the California Supreme Court that has to do the harmless error, in the first instance?           And here, this is puzzling about this case.       Defendant said, at trial, to his lawyer, "Don't argue any mitigators.            I'd just as soon die as spend my life in prison."          So, no mitigators were argued.          So then, even if you have a wrong aggravator, you have other aggravators that are right, and there's nothing to weigh against those correct aggregators.                  So, what mitigation is there to weigh against the valid aggravators?           Well, what were those?    I see that sentence.            The jury --           Yes, but what were the mitigating factors from the evidence presented at the guilt phase?          But now you're getting into what has sometimes been called "residual doubt."                  You point out that a juror asked, "What if it were not unanimous?"           And you also pointed out that there was an earlier hung jury in this case.                 But you didn't argue, below, that residual doubt counts.                  It's one thing to say, "If defendant argues it, the court should take it into account."         But there was no such argument made in this case.        At any time.        But in the trial court, it wasn't, because that's when it would count.        Didn't -- wasn't there a statement that he was indifferent between death and life imprisonment?        You mean aggravating --
05-1056 +++$+++                Mr. Waxman, this may, this may help focus that question.                   Suppose the master disks were made abroad.          You would be taking the same position, would you not?                 No.      That's given by Microsoft to one of its offices in Europe.                 But the golden disk itself is made abroad.                 Yes.                 So the only thing --                 The only thing supplied is this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it something else.    But anyway, it is the series of 0's and 1's; that's the only thing that's supplied from the United States?                 Any physical manifestation of it is done abroad.                    You would still be taking the position that you're taking, is that not so?
05-1074 +++$+++               Why is it different if the one further statement was made.                      And the employer knew that every woman is being paid less than every man.    Why isn't that sufficient under Title VII, and if you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh, we saw one year that she was outside the range appropriate for this job.              Evans involved a factor that simply is not present here.                 I mean, Evans involved a seniority system.              And if this person who had been off the job were to come back two years later, and bump people who had been there every day, well, certainly that's a different case than this one, where she is saying, I should have been paid equally.     I wasn't.     And I know I can go back only two years.     That's quite a bit different than the Evans situation.              If only the 180 day period counts, and she can complain only about discrimination in that period, then how do you account for her being able to go back not 180 days, but two years for her remedy?              I thought it was the lid on the amount of compensation you could get in Title VII cases.     You can't go back more than two years for damages.      But it would seem that doesn't fit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.              Why is she claiming that in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was way out of line.     Isn't that what the supervisor testified?              Maybe she thought that, well, they are on the right track.                   Next year, they are going to raise me up to the equal pay level.                The question that I asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and that is, where do you put these pay cases?               Do you put it in the box with the hostile environment that builds up over time, and as long as the environment is hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then it doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago.                This notion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other person got 3 percent, you really don't have an effective claim unless it builds up to the point where there is a noticeable disparity.             Where is that agreement?             I thought that the Morgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under Title VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable under Title VII.             Whatever portion it's in, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable --                How do you describe dealing with a case like Manhart where they were complaining about a pension plan that had been instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and years before?             This would be a good Equal Pay Act case, wouldn't it?                Why doesn't it become intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of the appropriate range for her job, whether she does it badly or well?                Why would she bring it then?   They gave her a big raise that year.                Didn't she have every reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but that it doesn't happen the next year?               She is not talking about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case.             She starts out even, and it builds up over time.             But you're talking about --             But that's a defense. And you're talking about, yes, you might draw that inference but that inference would be wrong because I have a defense.   The defense is poor performance explains it, not sex discrimination.                So why don't we at least hear from the EEOC?           That has happened in other cases where the Department of Justice and the EEOC take different positions, at least the EEOC filed a brief even though it wasn't the Government's brief.
05-1120 +++$+++               Mr. Garre, doesn't the EPA's decision on the first, "we don't have any authority," doesn't that infect its subsequent decision, "well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it."                 But they've already decided they don't have authority.                 -- I take it that on that question, is there authority, the EPA has come out one way, but at least it is debatable because as you just said, the predecessors of the current people said we do have the authority.               Which is why there's a significant difference between the agency saying that for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the agency's position was.       And here where it's a newly minted position, because the agency's position not too long ago was that they did have the authority.               That's a different question.   I'm just focusing on, did it have authority to deal with this issue?
05-1126 +++$+++               But I'm questioning you.     You say you meet the plus factor because they were acting against their self- interest, that a self-interested player in this league would have gone into the other's territory, and I'm questioning that by saying that they might have seen this whole area as not the best place to invest their money.              Mr. Richards, didn't the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor? They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs could show it, but the second sentence is you don't need a plus factor.              And that can be wrong or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no plus factor.              Well, it contains a time and a place.     It's quite specific that there was an accident and that defendant, defendant of a certain name at a certain time and place negligently drove.     What it doesn't tell you is the details of the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is specific in time and place and person, which is one of the -- one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to use a discovery process to find out whether or not that's true.     Isn't that essentially what this complaint is?             At what point does it get characterized as a class action, before this discovery or after?
05-11284 +++$+++                  It's the same kind of evidence.   It may be weaker.             In other words, it's not evidence of good deeds in the community.                  It's two specific kinds of evidence, the very kinds of evidence that were involved in Penry.              You can argue about whether this was weaker, but it's certainly different from youth and reputation for good character.                 But the evidence was that he didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds.                   On the contrary, he was gentle, kind, God fearing, and that's why the jury should regard the murder as aberrational.   That was the Graham picture, whereas here we're dealing with people who are dangerous.              What other choice does defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the future?   What else could counsel argue?              Yes.          Well, maybe sending counsel into those two questions, what violates the Eighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does and say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge. We're not going to bottle it up inside of two special questions.               But realistically, a defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the jury into those questions.               You're looking at what Texas law forced him to do.              Jurek was a facial challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see that there are things that would fit into it.                 Good character would fit into it.            But Jurek said as applied, we're not certainly not ruling on that.                 All we're saying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases come up the law is filled out.              But Jurek doesn't say -- Jurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that there are these two special factors, that everything can be squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way or another can be squeezed into them.               I thought in Johnson the only question presented was age.               Yes.               I don't see how this fits in the Graham package.      The Graham is, this child came from a deprived background but managed to survive it, and he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous. Look at all the bad things that were done to him.                  He turns out not to be dangerous.             Apart from this one murder, he's been a good boy.            That's not the picture in either of these cases.                Where is that charge?               Is that what the Penry Court was talking about, something like what you just read?               He's 30 years old, and the testimony is 40, 50.        It says, jury, for 10 years this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years.            And that's an effective --               Mr. Marshall, I heard what you read from this charge, and I don't have the exact words of what the Court was talking about in Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that his background and diminished mental capacity diminished his moral culpability, making the imposition of the death sentence unwarranted. So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse, because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those impairments.   That's the instruction that Penry said could be given and that would be okay under the deliberateness.   Quite different from the instruction you read.               Wasn't there something about moral culpability in what you read?               That's what Penry makes clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide that they reduce his moral culpability.                  And that's not what this charge was?               Are you suggesting that some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young child?                Unless you take the view that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that don't tie in at all to dangerousness.
05-11304 +++$+++              General Cruz, none of this went on in the opinion and there were four judges of that court who said there's a procedural bar here, end of case.       The majority never explained why they weren't going along with that.                 I didn't see anything in the majority opinion that said, well, never mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're going to deal with the Federal question.                  What instruction?          I haven't seen one.     I haven't seen --                  Is your instruction -- I think this is of some importance.                       My understanding in this case is that the judge as well as counsel thought that the judge couldn't say in essence what became the Texas law because the legislature put it in, which is:   Jury, is it two special issues, but you can consider all the mitigating evidence and it's up to you if you think that mitigating evidence is enough to have a life rather than a death sentence. That I thought the judge couldn't do.                   I have not seen a prelegislative change, charge in Texas that says what the legislature provided.               And so the jury, what they take into the jury room is something that says these are the two questions that you must answer.                Which tells them that the only way that they can give effect to mitigating evidence is if they answer one of those questions falsely.              General Cruz, how can you make that assumption when the kind of mitigating evidence that has been considered possible within these special questions, the -- the -- in the Graham case where the reputation of this young man, he was sweet, gentle, kind, God fearing, and so the murder that he committed was an aberration.                     And youth. Those are the two things that I know that we have recognized fall within that.             The evidence in this case is surely not that we are dealing with a sweet and kind person.   We are dealing with somebody who has been abused as a child and who has a mental disorder.

05-1240 +++$+++                   Miss Solomon, do I gather from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a pleading slip on petitioner's part?                       That is, if he had alleged a Fifth Amendment claim based on the coerced confession, then he wouldn't have a statute of limitations problem?                  That's a puzzling feature of it, too, because I thought at the end the second time around, the Court of Appeals held that the confession was no good.               Does your position in this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?                Is there any remedy that Illinois law provides for a case like this where a person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is ultimately released because the state never had enough evidence to try him in the first place?              Do you agree with Judge Wood that the limitation on damages would be from the period, from the time of the arrest until the arraignment?   That would be the measure and nothing after?

05-128 +++$+++              Mr. Verrilli, there's no employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the planning.         The planning is all done by the Government --             -- because what's covered is prescribed by law.             But the it is not negotiable.              We think of a health plan, a retirement plan.       That doesn't have to be any set coverage.                    It's negotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective bargaining situation, determines what the benefits will be.      Here, the law determines what the benefits will be.          But there's one feature of this that is -- does make it different, at least one, and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the way that the others are not.                 The employer -- there's a tradeoff in workers' compensation.                   It's not just I'm going to pay benefits when the person is injured, but I'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability that I might otherwise have.                 And in the other cases of the other benefits, there is no -- no such tradeoff.             Mr. Verrilli, before --            May I detract you just for a moment?         On -- on a question of the statutory history, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934, the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh priority claim.             And then in '38, Congress said no priority at all covering workers' compensation.                    And then when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it up to four or five, depending upon which version of the statute we use.             Is there any explanation why, when Congress originally assigned first a very low priority and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a par with the fringe benefits?           What is -- what is unemployment compensation?                Those two I think of as those are law-mandated coverage that every employer must have:          workers' comp and unemployment.        So what's unemployment, is that a plan too?
05-1284 +++$+++               Again, you're talking about an agency that has set certain standards that the entity its regulating must meet.               They must meet all kinds of requirements for certain kinds of tests by OSHA, say, for example.        Think of pesticides, think of hazardous substance -- quite precise tests that the Government says you must make this test before you market that dangerous product. I don't see how cigarettes are any different from hazardous wastes, pesticides, just the vast number of potentially dangerous to health products that are marketed and the Government says:                  We're not going to let you put those things out on the market unless you go through a certain testing regimen.                   That doesn't make the party an agent of the Government for the testing purposes.                  But there must be many times when an agency prescribes a test that a regulated party must comply with.          It's still a relationship of a regulator, the FTC, sets standards that the regulated party has to meet.      I just don't see -- it could be called "the FTC test," but it's a test for what?               Are you complying with the law when you're manufacturing and marketing this product?               I thought that, Mr. Olson, that the cigarette companies wanted to make a light brand so that they could keep customers who might be tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind. But to say that, the light cigarettes were forced on the cigarette companies by the FTC certainly --               Well, any product that the Government supervises, certainly the Government would want to promote a safer -- I mean, think of a jet ski.     Think of -- products are marketed because people want them, and off course the Government as supervisor will want to encourage a safer product.                   But let me ask you a different question, Mr. Olson. The removal area has been really closely guarded by Congress.        You know it's not easy to get a case out of State court and move it to the Federal court.     In fact, Congress has said if the Federal court shifts it back, no matter how wrong a that decision was, it stays in the State court. One can't remove -- you may have a wonderful Federal defense, a preemption defense.                   You can't remove on that basis.    You may have a counterclaim, so you're really the same as a plaintiff.               You can't remove on the basis of a counterclaim. Well, Congress has been so careful to let the State courts do State tort litigation.                   Then we are supposed to read into a Federal officer removal statute, that kind of, the removal of a State tort case from State court to Federal court?              Because that's quite the fashion.                Well there's one different.     If you're doing it for the Government, the Government says we want Agent Orange; we know it's a very dangerous substance.            So they give you an order; we're going to make very precise specifications.                 But you're doing it for us.          We, the Government, want that, and so we are going to put tight controls on your manufacturing it for us. A little was different from a commercial company going out to sell market goods to the public at large?                But the company is doing it so it can stay in business and market this product, not as a service to the U.S. Government.
05-130 +++$+++         Why is it your bottom line then, send it back with your four-factor test, because there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was applied?
05-1342 +++$+++               Practically, is there any difference between the way they operated when they were just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?
05-1345 +++$+++                   Ms. Halligan, how do you answer something in the Petitioner's brief that says there's no difference between this case and Carbone because these transfer stations are constructed and operated by a private company?
05-1429 +++$+++               And can we be, take one step before that and tell us if you are conceding that the Fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is wrong?               Yes, but we are not a court of first view and you know that very well.                  We are a court of review.      So no matter how well it's been aired, we wait to see what the lower courts have said on a question.    We don't take it in the first instance.              I understand that because they have the Fobian rule.               Why doesn't it serve the purpose of saying that the fees will be covered by the security?   They'll not be just be claims for fees that would stand together with the unsecured creditors, but that the oversecured -- the security will cover the interest, will cover the attorneys' fees, and that's the function of 506 whatever --              You're raising a provision that says just that, it's the absence of a provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on.              Where is the provision that generally disallows attorneys' fees?
05-1448 +++$+++                Was it specific in the plan or it just didn't exclude, the plan didn't exclude the possibility of merger?               So that could be if they just didn't say anything so it would be a choice.                    Just like it doesn't say, may not say anything about a lump sum, which would be an alternative.                    But your point --                Do I understand that your position is twofold?      One is you say you -- you put this on the table, the board was bound to consider it with their fiduciary hat.      So it's not just that they were to consider it.   But they had to consider it as a fiduciary and not as a sponsor?
05-1508 +++$+++                  Can you enlighten us a little bit about how this statute developed?                 As far as I know it was the same Secretary of Education when the statute came on the books and when the regulation was kind of readopted, I think it was --                 But there was a peculiar proposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to drop the bottom five.       So it was a different proposal, and what was the reason for that?                 Why keep, keep the 95th percentile but not the 5th?
05-1541 +++$+++ 
05-1575 +++$+++                Could you do it concretely, Mr. Verrilli, for this case.                     The defendant is being rather obstreperous and says:                    I don't want any mitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy.                     And that's how he's trying to portray himself.                     What -- you said, and you allow for the possibility that there could be a knowing waiver of mitigation.             What would have had to transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?
05-1589 +++$+++                But that's, under --               Under the Federal law you can't even have this opt-in system.                     You have to have a separate organization as I understand, for the election. So there would be no, no possibility that the nonmember of the union, that funds would go to election financing.               And that's much harder on the union, I would think, isn't it?              On which -- on what you were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished from what's in a corporate treasury or -- there is something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants it back, the non-member would be entitled.               So it's not like money in the corporate till.               Is this all hypothetical, Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what the people who are non-union members, if they had their druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the union till than we are forced to put there?                Is there any empirical evidence that divides up the universe of people who don't, deliberately don't join unions?
05-1629 +++$+++                 Mr. Meade, the Government says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal code would carry over to the vehicle code.              Well how about how -- how the defendant was charged in this very case? Mr. Himelfarb thought that it was plain from that charge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a principal.   And you must take the view that this charge, this information was inadequate to identify him as principal.
05-1631 +++$+++               Was there any case at the time of the action in this case, any decision that said ramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the Fourth Amendment?               Brower was a roadblock case.               But he certainly committed a lot of --               The key point is that he is endangering the lives and safety of others.                     Anyone who has watched that tape has got to come to that conclusion, looking at the road and the way that this car was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite direction.   This was a situation fraught with danger.                 Why wasn't there warning? There were lights, there were sirens.                    Surely the defendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.
05-18 +++$+++         Mr. Vladeck, why -- if that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?            Well, what -- Mr. Vladeck, may I stop you there?            Because the parents are always the plaintiff.           It's not the child.             The parents are representing the child.            So prevailing party is identical to parents.            The parents are the ones who prevail.        What about testing?      Isn't testing --          Mr. Vladeck, you have -- you referred to the section on GAO reporting --          -- as an assist to help you include consultant fees in -- in costs.               But how do you explain the -- the provision in this very statute that says attorneys' fees can be reduced?               Congress explicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys' fees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one word about reducing the costs of testing fees or consulting fees.          Then why -- then it would be unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees.          But it's not -- if the parents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it's not going to be free.           I mean, the -- the statute gives them --          -- a right to oppose the school board's choice, and if what you say about making it easier on parents of limited resources, they're told it's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get your fees.
05-184 +++$+++          Would you --         Would you --           General Clement, if you can straighten me out on the piece that you read about "consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States," I thought that it was the Government's position that these enemy combatants do not have any rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.           But what --           But how will the question, whether the laws in the United -- and Constitution -- of the United States, whether these petitioners have any claim to state under the laws and Constitution of the United States?         Because as I read -- the review that's provided doesn't open up that question.                It's a very narrow review that's given to the D.C. Circuit.          Is there --          Is there -- is there any review in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either the original classification or the conviction -- is there -- does this Court have any part in the scheme?         May I ask you another question about the clarity with which Congress spoke? This law was proposed and enacted some weeks after this Court granted cert in this very case.                It is an extraordinary act, I think, to withdraw jurisdiction from this Court in a pending case.              Congress didn't say, explicitly, it was doing that.              It hasn't done it, as far as I know, since MCArdle.             But there Congress said, "We are withdrawing jurisdiction in this very case."                They didn't say that here.           So, why should we assume that Congress withdraw our jurisdiction to hear this case once the case was already lodged here?
05-200 +++$+++             But how do you answer the question that I think Justice Breyer was -- was getting at, that it's -- it's a -- the -- what's in it for the carrier?         Nothing.      As -- if -- if every penny that the carrier collects is going to go into the U.S. Treasury, then why does the carrier care?
05-204 +++$+++ 
05-259 +++$+++            That would have been impossible here because there was no one in that entire unit who could operate a forklift except this one employee.           Is it -- is it -- was it in this category, this track category?                    Because it was something new for the employer.                There hadn't been a forklift operator.            I gather there had only been one before.           Does your test cover the person who's a former employee who complained under title VII, wants a recommendation letter, and isn't given one for retaliation -- as retaliation for having complained under title VII?               You won on the basis of the standard that the Sixth Circuit used, which was not your standard and not the EEOC standard.                    Why should this Court deal with anything other than that the petitioner's standard is unsatisfactory, that at least the Sixth Circuit standard -- why should the Court deal with the universe of cases when it has this case before it, two actions, and a unanimous Sixth Circuit judgment that says these two actions fall within 704?           Don't you want us to exclude this ultimate employment decision?                I think that's one thing.         In order to win, you have to say what counts is the suspension and not the ultimate decision.           So for you to win to preserve your Sixth Circuit victory, that would have to be ruled out.
05-260 +++$+++           Well -- well, why should you be if -- if an -- if this -- if you prevail in this case and then every other personal injury lawyer will make sure that that recovery goes into a trust for the care of the accident victims, never goes into their own investment account.          But -- but if the recovery is set up in such a way that it never goes into the personal account of the accident victims and, instead, just what happened in Great-West, isn't that what every personal injury lawyer will do if you prevail in this case?             So even if you had an early neutral evaluator who said this entire claim with pain and suffering and the medical, it's -- all together it's $100,000.              But there was some contributory negligence.              So I think $80,000 would be right.       So there would still be no prorating --
05-352 +++$+++           Are you saying that this -- trial is -- is one thing.                 Appeal -- but you say he would do the appeal over?              He'd do the appellate argument over?           Do the petition for cert over with counsel of choice?          There's a different stage involved.          Are you -- are you relying at all on the effect that you want the Court's decision to have on trial judges and prosecutors, that is, a judge who knows if he disqualifies a lawyer who shouldn't be disqualified, that there will be an automatic new trial?           And the prosecutor who's standing by -- by the way, what did the prosecutor -- did the prosecutor take the position in this case when the judge says, I don't want that lawyer to be in my courtroom?        Mr. Fisher, remind me in bringing up the plea question.               I thought one of the reasons why this defendant wanted this particular lawyer is that this lawyer made good bargains with the prosecutor.              Was that not so?          I thought they said there isn't if the question is remedied.
05-380 +++$+++              Ms. Smith, was the statement of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists before Congress?             If we could go back to the first question that the Chief asked you, you said yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain line between the D&X and the D&E.          Is there a way that Congress could have written the statute that would have insulated the physician who's performing a D&E?              If there were a health exception --              The health of the woman, would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth problems that you bring up?            Because then after we say to the doctor, you put the health of your patients first and if you think that it's riskier for her health to do it one way than another way, then you pick the safer way. If you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about overbreadth fade?
05-381 +++$+++                Who proposed the instruction in this case?               There was no requested charge on this point by the plaintiff?                Why?          Why is it easy to figure out?    As Justice Breyer brought up the stockpiling, how do you know whether they are storing it, or a time when the supply is short, or they are just letting it go to rack and moon in order to put this company out of business?                 Do you -- do you agree that you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because they were selling these logs at a profit?                 Do you agree that you could not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test because Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these sales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?
05-409 +++$+++           But they can always amend the complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we complained all along about negligence.                    Now, Judge, we are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants' part, nothing more.           No manipulation.           Cut out -- they could have such a complaint, and would that be precluded if -- if they started afresh in the State court and they said, we are complaining about mismanagement?           We're not charging anyone with fraud or deception.          Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim?             But then, Mr. Perry, there's a whole case.               See, what's peculiar about this is Congress says it's not really preemption.                    I think Justice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit.                   It is preclusion.              It says this action shall not exist. Period.        Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim. And it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that determination.              It surely didn't want -- if -- if the State claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the Federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is a non-diverse, no Federal question case.                    I mean, it just seems -- if you're going to imagine what Congress wouldn't want in the Federal court, that would be it.          But now there you must admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing, to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or, if not, then to remand.           So they make -- they make one determination and bow out he said.                 And you're telling us, no, they don't bow out.               They can, if they want to, keep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the merits.          Yes.   I'm simply asking about the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case. It says, after making the decision that 77p(b) requires, the district court has nothing else to do. Dismissal and remand are the only options.               So Judge Easterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not think that there was any adjudication on the merits of a State law claim to be made.               He said it twice.   One is at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a.          But I don't think that any of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case is going to be tried someplace. Take a diversity case.           The Federal court has to decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties are really diverse.           If it decides that they are really diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in Federal court.           If it decides they're not, the case is adjudicated in the State court. But here, the determination is, is there a claim to be tried anyplace?               And if there is preclusion under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge Easterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where question.         It's a whether question.               And so that makes -- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where the -- the case is going to be tried someplace.           Here, the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried or not?        Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim?        Yes, but -- but there is also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect. I did not have that full and fair opportunity because I was unable to appeal.           And I think that that's a solid preclusion law.          And a Nassau County court could say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive. They didn't have a fair chance to appeal.             And that would be all right.          But in any case, you said Easterbrook made only one mistake.          But he made another one when he said, it's now or never for appellate review. That preclusion question could come to this Court if it went -- the case went back and the Nassau County said, well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not going to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion question would be open for this Court to review.            Now or never.     The question is not can you -- is there an appeal or does 1447(d) bar it.          The question is whether an action under State law is preempted. And suppose this case had gone along in the Federal -- in the State court, and the defense of preclusion is made in the State court.                   The State court could certainly decide that question.                   Nobody removed it.      So the State court has competence to decide that question, doesn't it?        And in -- this Court could decide it on review.        Was that a case where there was no possibility of reviewing the decision of the court of first instance?        And why --           You're -- you're positing a -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give that Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say, the Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision didn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect.            I thought Munsingwear was about mootness.        But not if the litigant asks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant would be entitled to have it vacated.                  So it was a foot fault and the -- the Court held the counsel to the mistake that had been made.        How do you answer the argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights actions removable under 1443?              In all those cases, it provided specifically for review of remand decisions, and here the silence is deafening.            I don't know what -- what Congress' knowledge about Thermtron was a district judge who said, they removed this case, but I'm much too busy.         This court is much too busy to mess with stuff that belongs in the State court.                     I'm remanding it.      That was just too much, and the Federal court --
05-416 +++$+++         Mr. Feder --           Mr. Feder, there is one anomaly that the Government points out.                  And I -- before you sit down, I'd like to know what your answer is.                     They said, "Imagine one prisoner who begins the grievance process on time, he goes to step two, goes to step three, then he stops.           And then another prisoner who waits til the time has come and gone, she files.                   The prison says, 'We don't take late filings.'                The second prisoner gets to court, and the first, who did go through three steps, but stopped short of the fourth, doesn't have any access to Federal Court."
05-465 +++$+++           I thought your position was it shouldn't be read at all because --          -- this -- this Court is a court of review, and to take a question that was never certified, even to the court of appeals, to have this Court address it seems to me very strange.               It seems to me to erode rather starkly the final judgment rule, which we don't have here.
05-493 +++$+++                But wouldn't a jury think all this evidence must have some purpose?                  The only purpose it could have is to -- is to propel us toward life rather than death.   I mean, the bulk of the evidence at the sentencing phase -- wasn't it? -- was how he behaved when he was a prisoner before.              Even so, there was --              -- there was extensive testimony about his prospects for doing good in a prison setting.              And the jury must have thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that evidence in.    And what reason could it be, other than to show that, if he is given life, he will be a good prisoner?               Mr. Multhaup, one aspect of your argument I wish you would clarify, and that's in your brief at page 20, footnote 3.             As I understand it, you are saying -- you are not challenging factor -- the factor (k) instruction as excluding Skipper evidence.                     Your challenge is limited to this particular case.                     Is that what you're saying in that footnote?               And the --               -- the "much more" is the questions that the jury asked?               And yours is both pre- and post- -- that is, you're referring to conduct that took place before this crime was committed -- that is, his prior incarceration -- and asking the jury to project that forward to say, "That's how he behaved in prison, before he committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's likely to behave again."
05-502 +++$+++           I thought that probable cause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts didn't question that there was probable cause.        You don't -- you can't attribute what you just said to the trial court, and you emphasize the trial court's findings.                  The trial court said about what went wrong what the police should have done, as required under the Fourth Amendment, was knock on the door.        The evidence is there was a loud, tumultuous thing going on and that the occupants probably would not have heard him.                 But under the Fourth Amendment, he has an obligation to at least attempt before entering.            Now, that's a statement that what went wrong was they didn't knock even though it was likely a futile act. Do you -- do you agree that that's a correct statement of the law, that what the police didn't do that they should have done was knock?          Where did the -- where did the trial court say that in the findings of fact?             I'm looking at the findings of fact.             They're in the petition appendix at page 46 and 47.             I don't see anything that has been specifically identified by the finder of fact as inadequate, other than the failure to knock.                    Where -- where did the -- where does the court say it doesn't rise to the level of exigent circumstances?             Yes, but what it says right after that to explain is it would have been sufficient.              What he -- what he should have done was knock, and that would have supplied all that was necessary.        Well, there seemed to be agreement that they couldn't have made their presence known because the noise inside was so loud that they would not have been heard.         The Utah Supreme Court seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah protection against the -- the counterpart to the Fourth Amendment.          They seemed to suggest that their own constitution afforded greater protection to the privacy of the home. Was there a reason why you argued only the U.S. Constitution and not the State constitution?
05-5224 +++$+++         Why don't you incorporate what the Solicitor General has suggested, that is, you draw the line at urgent emergency statements that are calling for -- for immediate help?
05-547 +++$+++                 Mr. Kneedler --              -- if there is room for more than one construction of this statute, it seems to me unseemly, in the immigration context, to say that two people who have committed the identical acts, one of them is barred from ever coming back, doesn't have any of the dispensations, and the other does, because of the happenstance of the State in which they were convicted. That kind of disuniformity in an area where the Constitution expressly charges Congress with authority to make uniform laws, it's -- doesn't that uniform-law specification in the Constitution tug in the direction of the interpretation that Mr. Long was --              -- presenting to us?              Then, in those cases, you can say the conduct would constitute a felony under the Federal statute; but here, if I recall correctly, the amount involved would not have qualified for possession with intent to distribute, under Federal law.                Mr. Kneedler --                Do you --              Barrett suggests otherwise. If what Congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of looking for an analogous crime under State law, that's -- that seems to me the -- at least what Congress was trying do.              You --                 May I --                 May I just switch gears for a moment, because your time is almost up, and we -- you haven't addressed the mootness problem in Toledo-Flores.                 Is the Second Circuit wrong in U.S. v. Hamdi?     Because it seems to me that U.S. v. Hamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness.
05-593 +++$+++              That was the position of the district court, though, wasn't it?             Well what about the, Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee working within the scope of his employment or was he off on a frolic of his own?     I think that's the kind of question that the Chief Justice put to you.             The certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General said what he was doing was within the scope of employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with his friends and they got in his car and killed someone. If that certification within the scope was wrong and instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United States isn't substituted.             I thought that that case was about, was the certification reviewable?             But the Court said that that could be reviewed.             Right.              Then it's more than pendent jurisdiction, because pendent jurisdiction leaves it up to the Federal court to either retain the State claim or send it back.            So this is -- what you're suggesting is something other than pendent jurisdiction.             Is that so?      If the employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but it's staying in Federal court under this pendent jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be entitled to a jury trial?
05-595 +++$+++                How many times have we dealt with a quote, "new rule," with the argument made that it was watershed and therefore should be retroactive?    This is not the first time.                Ms. Forsman, what about the cases we're had so far on this second Teague category?    As far as I know -- well, we haven't found anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far, so this would be the first time.              What about the decision that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on collateral?              This is for children under ten, isn't it?              As you just said.              And here we had someone who was six years old and was hardly articulate, it seems from the little we have of this record.                    So the Nevada statute I think was very specific to children and was not --
05-5966 +++$+++            Mr. Howe, would you explain to me how the State has proved intentional -- not intentional killing, but of a police officer?                      If that's the charge, that he intended to kill a police officer, how does the State meet its burden on a police officer if the testimony on the other side is, "I did not understand that this human that I killed was a police officer"?           I see that on the --           -- the State side, so the State has introduced evidence from which a trier could conclude he intended to kill a police officer.                   But he wants to introduce, on the other side, "I didn't have that intent.             In fact, I had delusions.          I thought I killed an alien."              But he's not allowed to introduce that evidence             --             -- to counter --             -- the State's proof, as I understand what the Arizona law is.          Mr. Howe, one of the things that puzzled me about your position is, you said, "Under Arizona law, while this doesn't come in under mens rea, it does affect sentencing."                   I think you said that the -- his mental state is properly taken into account in the sentencing.                  And, by that, did you mean just the length of the incarceration, or the place of the incarceration?          But here, there --          -- was a charge, "intended to kill a police officer."             It could have been just "intended to kill."         And I think Mr. Goldberg conceded that "intended to kill" would have been a proper conviction, but not "intended to kill a police officer" --        -- unless he's allowed to counter that add-on.
05-5992 +++$+++         How can we say it's purely procedural with respect to the first time?             I mean, the reason that was given is I have to -- I need this time to find out if these really peculiar looking bonds are genuine. Now, the -- the Second Circuit said -- and I don't understand why they said this -- this is a complex case so that continuance is warranted.             Was this a complex case?         In this -- is there a statute of limitations problem in -- in these cases if their dismissal is without prejudice?          Well, in this case, the judge told the defendant I've got a solution to this. Here's my form.        Which court?        The -- is that -- is there any reason to believe that the judge, of course, would clarify it and say the ends of justice, if we took your remand solution.        Well --        It seems to me that in this case, that -- that all-purpose waiver that the judge, and not for the first time, proposed is -- is what caused all this.         And -- and my question that I had is knowing that this was the judge's practice -- and indeed, he had written about it -- did the U.S. Attorney's Office try to do something to say, look, the act doesn't permit that kind of thing?         Are you -- are you relying to any extent on something that I think you brought up? He also could not have been tried because the prosecutor was having a difficult pregnancy and she was on extended leave, which was occurring in this period?
05-608 +++$+++                 Was that a case about Article III case or controversy?               But the question --               The question that is presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, "You have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a reasonable apprehension that you will be sued"?                 Could the --                 -- patent holder take the position that, "I -- Sooner or later, I'm going to have to fight out validity with someone, and might as well do it sooner rather than later, so I am not going to raise the license as a defense"?         Would that be a "case or controversy"?                Is it -- it's -- no, the patent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants a declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without the fear of an infringement suit.                Yes.                And the patent holder chooses not to plead the license -- chooses not to plead the license.   Wouldn't the patent holder have that option?                I don't mean their view.   I mean, they start a lawsuit.               They say, "We're -- we want" --               -- "we want a declaration of infringement."     And the patent holder doesn't take the position that you're taking; instead says, "I'm prepared to fight this out now.         I know that I have the license, which could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going to raise it.     I'm going to go head to head on the validity of this patent."     Would that be a case or controversy?               So, even --               -- even if the patent holder chooses not to raise the license, the court would have to, on its own motion, say, "Sorry, you didn't -- you're not the master of your defense.               We decide that you have to effectively plead the license."              Do I remember that --               But that wasn't -- the District Court, in this very case, seemed to say, "I think this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I must follow Gen-Probe."        The District Court, at least as I read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a different direction from where the Federal Circuit was before.                But what -- but jurisdiction is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to do this?     A discretion question is different.                    It's, "We have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of equity, we're not going to do so."                        The power question, I think, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either the court has the power, or doesn't.
05-6551 +++$+++             And they can't be a fact -- in California, it can't be a fact found by the jury, as Justice Stevens pointed out.            That's a significant difference.
05-669 +++$+++             So, there's no limit at all, and you concede that that's the case.              So, the Government could go back on these royalties as long as it likes.            Because you're --            -- you made the point that the issue letter is just raising the issues, and it's not charging, as a complaint would allege, "You owe us," but this is, "Maybe you owe us."
05-705 +++$+++            Are you making the point that Chief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a charge that is fair and reasonable?          Are there regulations, FCC regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair and unreasonable?
05-7053 +++$+++         Do --        Doesn't that come from an underlying principle that your position is not entirely consistent with, that is, that the defendant is presumed innocent?             So it's not as Justice Scalia may have suggested that, well, he would plead guilty, but we're going to let him -- we presume that the defendant is innocent.             That's why the prosecutor has to have the burden on all issues.              I thought that was the underlying principle.        What about the insanity defense?        What about self-defense?
05-7058 +++$+++               But that doesn't include failure to exhaust.               And if you follow the normal rule, that that's an affirmative defense, then, then the burden would be on the prison to do just what it did in the Jones case.         Why, why would we say, depart from the normal rule that makes exhaustion an affirmative defense when we know that the party best equipped to provide the information about exhaustion is the prison, as the Jones case showed so well?                 They, the prison, had all of the grievances.                 They had all of the responses and they presented that to the court.                 So the prisoner is less well equipped to attach those papers than the prison is, so why isn't it not only traditional to have exhaustion as an affirmative defense, but makes the most sense because the one most likely to have the information is the prison?              If Congress meant to reverse the ordinary burden on pleading exhaustion, why didn't it put that in?       It was expanding the categories and it included failure to state a claim, which had not been there before, and it included if you sue somebody who has got immunity.      But it didn't include exhaustion, so why should we read that in?              It's not in the screening.   It doesn't say you screen out for failure to exhaust.              But there are other provisions than "no action shall be brought."                Take a statute of limitations that reads "No action shall be brought after two years" or something like that.                There is no action shall be brought.              Does that make it no longer an affirmative defense?               Well, all the criteria are there, but failure to exhaust is not.               But last time -- and you said before the statute was there were only frivolous and malicious.   And the court says, we can see from the face of this complaint that it fails to state a claim, too bad it's not a ground for automatic dismissal.                    So Congress said, yes, it should be, and put that one in.              And that's not -- the statute doesn't settle that.            Our decisions settle that, right?   So why should we deal with that, the two, any differently?   It's not as though Congress wrote the statute differently.      We said you can't proceed with unexhausted claims, so you have a choice.               Either you go out of the Federal court and exhaust everything -- or even you don't have to go out; you could use the stay in abeyance -- or you just lob off the unexhausted claims, stay in the Federal court on the ones that you have exhausted. That's all made up by this Court.              So why should the Court react differently in the PLRA than it did?   Why should it fill those gaps differently than it did in habeas?               I was suggesting that in habeas it is the prisoner's option to say I don't want the whole case dismissed.           I will amend my petition so that the court will have, will retain the exhausted claims.    You are saying not like habeas, I don't want it to be like habeas, because if it were like habeas, the prisoner would have the option to stay in the federal court as long as he lopped off the unexhausted claims. You don't want it.      You don't want it to be like habeas?                What is the purpose of that requirement?    As long as he has made known in the administrative proceeding what his problem it, and they have had a chance to investigate it and determine whether it has merit or not, why should he have to name the individuals who made the decision in order, before he can sue them when he later finds out who they are?               How about Jones, who really did not know who was the doctor who said no surgery?     He didn't know and then the prison told him. And he comes to the court, he says thanks, prison, for telling me, and so he names that person in his complaint.     The Sixth Circuit said that's no good, he didn't put it in his initial complaint.                   He had only 15 days to find out and he didn't find out.               So Jones did properly exhaust, then, if you just made that confession, then Jones properly exhausted?               It's not an absolute policy, though.    It isn't that if you haven't named him in the first administrative step, you can't name him in the complaint.    That's not Michigan's new policy.               Isn't there an exception when you couldn't find out?
05-746 +++$+++ 
05-785 +++$+++            And that language came from one of our opinions, didn't it?               The branding language?           So you can't fault the court for just saying it isn't that.                Mr. Ott says it isn't that.           But in here it -- you agree that the California court has as much authority to say what Federal law is as the Ninth Circuit, right?                 They are on a par.    Ninth Circuit decisions in no way binds the Supreme Court of California.                Isn't that so?             So that this state court of appeals chose to be respectful to the Ninth Circuit to consider what it had said, doesn't sound to me like a very strong argument.             But in Williams and Flynn and all of the cases that we have had, whatever way they went, it was always the government requiring a defendant to do something, wear prison clothes, appear in court with shackles.    And in the case that went for the government, the extra officers in the courtroom. We haven't had a case, have we, where it is spectator conduct as opposed to government conduct that's being attacked?             That certainly goes beyond where our precedent leaves off.               That is, we are dealing with direct impositions by government in a way that poses an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the defendant.           But there have been -- haven't there been court decisions that have held that buttons didn't compromise a fair trial right?           So in assessing the reasonableness of the California Supreme Court's decision, how could we say Federal law was clearly established when other courts considering our precedent have gone the other way?             There was a time when the trial judge said stop.    Was there not?              He initially denied the motion.             But I thought that there was a time in the course of the trial when he told the family members to stop wearing the buttons.

05-848 +++$+++              Then why were some companies asking for declarations of nonapplicability?             But Mr. Donahue said that there were nonapplicability applications after those early ones that came out the other way.              So there were companies --             -- who asked for a declaration of nonapplication and then EPA took the position that it is currently taking.
05-85 +++$+++                 The immunity question, the immunity question is the same as State or Federal court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court jurisdiction because Congress said so. But with respect to the commercial enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial. That doesn't apply to State courts.               There was a sovereign party who said:   I'm out of this; I have suit immunity. And that was the B.C. --               What happened to B.C. Hydro?   Because as I understand the district court sent that party back, too.               Yes, but it couldn't -- if you are right, then the Ninth Circuit never should have touched this case.        So what happens to the three parties, two U.S. parties, one British Columbia, who are entitled to suit immunity?                Immunity, suit immunity, is you can't be sued anyplace, not in State court, not in Federal court; you can't be sued, period.                 But now it is admitted that you can be sued.                That's not in dispute in this case, right?                So the only question is where.                The question is if --               But they raise that there is still the question of Federal forum over State forum.
05-8794 +++$+++            But there's no statute and there's no regulation that requires Florida to do that.          But there is no statute, no regulation.           That means the executive can do what it will.       There's nothing that binds them to the way it was done in Sims' case.          And I suppose that's -- that's the complaint.            If there was a procedure in place, we could address it.               If Florida reserves to itself the ability to change at any time, well, that's -- we want to be told what it will be in our particular case so we have a target that we can aim at.         Would he have to come up --        -- with, as you suggest, an alternative that would be acceptable?               Suppose there had been a hearing and it was proved more probable than not that in some cases -- not in all, but in some cases -- use of this injection would cause excruciating pain. Would the Petitioner who is objecting being exposed to that have to come up with an alternative in order to avoid the risk of excruciating pain?        Well, my question to you is -- I take it you're answering yes, that if they prove that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, that's not good enough unless the Petitioner proposes an alternative, that it's all right for the State to expose someone to the risk of what has -- what has been determined to be the risk of excruciating pain as long as the Petitioner himself doesn't come up with an alternative.             Well, because there's been no hearing.              We've never gotten past is this -- can you open the door through 1983, and I -- I still don't understand what your answer is to my question. Now, I'm supposing that we do have the 1983 hearing, and the judge says, yes, I agree with the Petitioner's experts.               In some cases there will be excruciating pain.             Then you say, but, Judge, they haven't come up with an alternative.             And the judge says, you're both right.              Some people have excruciating pain, but there's been no alternative suggested.                      Bottom line of that particular case would be?             So the answer is yes.             The court, having found that some people will be subject to excruciating pain, still no Eighth Amendment violation because the Petitioner hasn't come up with an alternative.          What about the risks that the prisoner will die an excruciating death?                  I'm asking you the same question that I asked co-counsel. What happens then?        He hasn't been able to come up with an alternative, but the judge finds it credible that he may be exposed to an excruciating death.                  What then?          But would --          Why not?     Because he's saying I am not asking for this to be one day further along.       I'm just asking the State to give me a death that will not require me to suffer excruciating pain.
05-8820 +++$+++               So why shouldn't it be the same way for collateral review as it is for direct review?   Direct review, everyone agrees that you get the state final judgment.       But then you have 90 days and nothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is granted, until the cert process is done.                    Why shouldn't it be just the same for collateral review?              Well that means, that means that if a petitioner who has had his state application for collateral relief denied wants to petition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the possibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has to do two things at the same time:                One, prepare a petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare a complaint to file in a Federal district court.                   That's a lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't represented.               Here there were 31 days, right?               They'd have to file a Federal court complaint and a cert petition within the 31 days.              Wouldn't a district judge who knows that there's a cert petition pending just say: Well, I'll wait; this petition will be held pending the Supreme Court's disposition of cert.               Mr. Kise, there are two applications.   Your answer to the petitioner is you have to file in the Federal court within that 31 days.                 If a prisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a Federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get any assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other, isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that you're proposing going to be an incentive or a disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a right to do?   He is going to have to pick one or the other if he is in this timeline.
05-908 +++$+++                Mr. Madden, there was a question raised about your categories, that is, you have white and then everything else.              And it was suggested that if you are looking for diversity, what was -- the schools that you just mentioned had a large percentage of Asian-Americans, but they don't count. What is your response to that?               You're saying that individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the objective here.    I thought that's what you were saying.                 And the question of integration, whether there was any use of a racial criterion, whether integration, using racial integration is the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far from the kind of headlines that attended the Brown decision.   They were, at last, white and black children together on the same school bench.                   That seems to be worlds apart from saying we'll separate them.
05-9222 +++$+++                I thought the law was that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the unless is that the judge makes an additional finding, the very same kind of finding that he would make in determining aggravating factor.            Wasn't that overturned in Ring?
05-9264 +++$+++               And would you agree, Mr. Marcus, that this Court's decision in Shepard excludes that interpretation?           If you look at the particular crime?              Even though there's some cases in this large category that clearly wouldn't involve any risk to anybody.            Say the enterprising but careful burglar who keeps watch for several days to see when no one is in the house, that that's when he chooses to make his entry.
05-983 +++$+++                   What about the provision that says at no cost to the parent?                 But that's when the child reaches majority.                 The child is no longer a child, the child is an adult.                There's a section you pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph (d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).                Well then, if this provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you argue that it covers the waterfront?               So if you agree we're talking about.   What is the toll on the states, it seems to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer, if it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not entitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook affected?
05-996 +++$+++               So it wouldn't be before the First Circuit.              It's hardly a summary disposition.   The opinion goes on for pages and pages.              Could the Chapter 7 trustee be appointed the trustee in the Chapter 13, the same trustee who has now been -- he's terminated because the Chapter 7 has been converted.            Could the court in the Chapter 13 format appoint the same trustee?
05-998 +++$+++               How do you distinguish the mail -- the letter carrier case that Justice Breyer posed, because there you said even though there was no evidence at all of what this person was, if the petit jury found it, that would not be subject to review.                I don't think you answered Justice Breyer and he said if you concede that, the failure to introduce any evidence that this person was a letter carrier.            Were you, were you surprised at trial by the evidence that the defendant had submitted two false identifications?           Was the first time you heard about that at trial?            But were you, was there any element of surprise in this trial?           Did you not know beforehand that the Government was going to present evidence of two false identifications?            So there was no lack of notice; there was no surprise.            Well, surely submitting false identification could be a overt act.            Is there any doubt about that?            Yes, but you knew that -- you had the file.    You knew the Government was going to prove this.    And you also knew it was an overt act.              Does the Government have to pick one overt act and say that's it, when it introduces evidence of a whole string of them?                Suppose this indictment charged not an attempt to enter, but unlawful entry. Then the indictment would be sufficient, right?                There wouldn't be any problem with it?                It charged, not an attempt, but an unlawful entry.             Anything missing from the indictment?                But substantive offense is one thing.   Lesser included, I think you said earlier it couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to the same punishment.      So it is not lesser?
06-1005 +++$+++                That's not your question presented.                Well, let's take this context. There is, if you are going to go with profit, a question of what expenses?                     That's one of the difficulties of working with a net proceeds, because we don't know what the expenses that you would deduct, and the hit man was given as one example.                    You said no, not that one.    But salaries to the runners, yes. To figure out what would count to come up with a net figure is the least difficult, is it not?
06-10119 +++$+++                  Mr. Laws was an identical -- he came up too.              He said --              Before -- before the rebuttal, this prosecutor was going around advertising this as his O. J. Simpson case, and the defense attorney said please, Judge, get him to stop saying that.                 This is long before -- you are painting a picture of someone who was answering an argument made by the defense, but this prosecutor initiated it, and the defense attorney was reacting.   She said judge, he's talking in this county, that county about this is his O. J. Case; stop him from doing that.                  Then he says I'm an officer of the court, and I'm giving you my word.              What's the difference between that and "okay"?              One says I can make arrangements, and the other is more economical and he says "okay."   -- meaning Brooks.              The difference is between "I can make arrangements" and "okay."                  That wasn't done here. That was the point that you made.               When the third -- the back strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone back for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't.                 Mr. Boudreaux, I'd like to ask you a question before you finish.                  It is not an issue in this case, but we are told that African-Americans are 20 percent of the population of Jefferson Parish, but they were less than 11 percent of the people summoned for jury duty. Is that typical?                That's -- and because it's almost half of what you would expect.                Thank you.
06-102 +++$+++                  There couldn't be any question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction here, because it, in fact, had.               A proceeding was ongoing in China.    So you brought up the question about the Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient forum doesn't take the case.             But that can't be a factor in this case, where the other forum was in China and was indeed litigating the case.                  I'm sorry.        I'm not following you, so please straighten me out.                     I thought that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court.                  Your claim was that a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in connection with the arrest of this vessel and the ensuing proceedings?                  Now, why in the world should a court in the United States get involved in determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese court?               American law to determine whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court? It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to the Chinese court to have another court determine whether it had been defrauded.               Well, that was a very polite way of the Chinese court saying:                We don't care what the United States court is doing; we've got this case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate it; and it doesn't matter.           We don't have to say anything to the United States to chastise it for even thinking it could become involved in this matter.                It was polite.              Why would a defendant that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive jurisdiction?    It seems to me that there is something in this picture that is to your advantage and that is if you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not going to get that discovery.                But we know that that's not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has adjudicated the case.                We're dealing with, because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406.                 And you are treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is forum non conveniens.      But 1406 is wrong venue and, as you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction and is a place of improper venue. Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of 1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue, you just transfer it to a place where those conditions exist?
06-1037 +++$+++                And with respect to that, Mr. Stewart, the problem that Justice Breyer brought up, you -- if you would look to your brief, page 30, footnote 13, the question is, so we have this -- if we take your interpretation of the statute, how can we deal with a person in her 30s who becomes disabled when she is making a low salary and has only, say, 10 years of service?   She is going to get a very low disability. And you say that's one thing that's all right. On a prospective basis, what could Kentucky do?   One is give the younger workers only their actual years of service, which Mr. Klausner said is what is happening, and therefore, these people are getting a lot less than they used to get.            And then you say, oh, but there's another way, and that is to impute additional years of service on an age-neutral basis.               And you're not specific about what would the age-neutral basis be.              Mr. Stewart, before you finish, that little piece that seems to be favoring the younger worker that you guaranteed at least -- what was it, 25 percent of your final monthly salary, and you get 10 percent for each child -- now that does seem to be something that's -- that's not available for a regular retiree.
06-1082 +++$+++ 
06-11206 +++$+++                 Mr. Roberts, wouldn't that be so of any crime?          This is failure to report. Any crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain risk that the arrestee is going to resist.                 Is there anything different, is anything greater, about this arrest for this kind of crime?              That's what Mr. Hochman told us --              -- when I asked that question.               But would the statute apply if -- say he is supposed to go in on the weekends. Instead, he goes out on a binge, and then he voluntarily comes in on a Monday morning saying, yes, I failed to report, and so here I am.               The distinction between this crime and crimes in general is that this person has shown that he or she doesn't want to go back into custody, is that --               There is -- there was, this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?               And am I correct in understanding that since this case was decided, the Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone the other way?               The first time around, didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to report, and isn't that what we now have from the Sentencing Commission?
06-11429 +++$+++                   Well, I suppose it might for countries that use that classification, for common law countries.                 The -- the information we have in the brief says that there are two States that have dropped those labels.           Are there more than New Jersey and Maine?
06-11543 +++$+++                How about a habitual speeder?                 One of the anomalies about this, and we start out -- this is an armed career criminal.   And you can say, well, burglary -- burglary and arson, if you're apprehended, you're the career criminal; you commit these kinds of crimes.                      Congress doesn't want you to have a gun, or if you do, you're going to get the book thrown at you.                      But there doesn't seem to be much of a connection.                 I mean how -- how is it going to make the dangerous -- the drunk driver more or less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the glove compartment?               What else -- what else would be in this catalogue?           You rejected my speeder, but I think you said something about a reckless driver might, habitually reckless driver.                What else would fit the description "conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another"?                  I'd like to know specifically.    You said reckless driving; and what else?                  That has the potential of doing that, not --                  But wouldn't that come in in the first, the violent crime, the first part?               May I ask about something in your brief on page 37?         You said:            "Congress settled on this language because it had two other proposals, one that it considered too narrow and one that it considered as potentially too broad."           And the one that it considered potentially too broad is "any felony that by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against a person or property of another may be used in the course of committing an offense is the" -- this is on page 37 of your brief.
06-116 +++$+++               Ms. Brinkmann, Congress sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the order -- there's no automatic dismissal of the case when Congress passes an act.         There is a case lodged in the court, and that court will follow Congress's directions and dismiss it.    But until it does, its hold final judgment.   The judgment of the Guam Supreme Court is suspended while it's sub judicata before the Ninth Circuit, and then when the Ninth Circuit acts, then there is a trigger.     But until there isn't.               The Ninth Circuit would have been without authority to issue the orders in Santos under your reasoning.           The Ninth Circuit is powerless because the authority had been transferred by virtue of the statute to this Court, so the Ninth Circuit was wrong in any orders it issued.                  And then when they decide they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive? That's what your position is?                  The Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction this whole time.              But the day that it issues its decision dismissing this case, then it is retroactive back to the date that Congress passed the statute?    That's what you seem to be saying.                 But those cases really are not on point.    Because there was a vast confusion in the days when there was a three-judge court, do I file a jurisdictional statement, do I file a cert petition? Sometimes this Court said we'll treat the jurisdictional statement as a cert petition.              But those existed from the beginning.    Here there's a case lodged in the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals had every basis of jurisdiction.    This was no big shakes about it.                     It wasn't, did they file the right paper?                     And then Congress does something.          And the Court would follow suit. It just seems to me very strange to say the court has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction, but if it decides it doesn't, then the date of that order is not the critical date, but you go back to the date that Congress passed the law.               Do they tax on the basis of the --               This is a fractional, this 35 percent.   In the other places, do they use as the -- the value taxed 100 percent of the property --                -- and then just have a lower tax rate?              Did this value issue -- I mean, was the borrowing effective given the controversy between, the attorney general refused to sign, did that have any consequences for whether this bond issue went through?
06-11612 +++$+++                 Ms. Blatt, if you, if the Government prevails, what happens to the 11th Circuit's ruling in the -- what was it, the Maragh --                -- case where the 11th th Circuit said, we're not going to mess with any constitutional question, but under our supervisory power, we're going to tell the district -- the magistrate judges, district judges in this circuit; it's a simple thing to do, put on the record that the defendant himself consented. That would be -- that would no longer be valid, right?               They specifically said, we're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under the Constitution.     So my question was could a circuit still say, we think it's better for the defendant himself to be told, so in our circuit that's going to be the rule?
06-1164 +++$+++                 But you certainly would be mixing categories terribly if you suggested that something that goes to the court's authority to proceed in the case can be waived if it's equitable to waive it. I mean, those two notions are at odds with each other.               Well, what would, what would Irwin and Franconia that made statements -- when it's a question of a time limit, they operate against the government just like they operate against private parties, to what kind of case would that apply?                    I mean, it's been pointed out that 2501 covers a whole slew of cases, not just takings cases.               What about -- what about the rules of the Court of Federal Claims?                Rule 8(c) states that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense.   And that's in suits against the Government because that's all the Court of Federal Claims deals with.   So to what would that Rule 8(c) apply?                  But all those statutes of limitations would be statutes of limitations operating against the government.               Would you say that Franconia did use loose language, because although it dealt with accrual -- when does the claim accrue, and not when is it cut off -- but it did say, it called 2501 specifically "an unexceptional statute of limitations."               And if we looked at the Court of Federal Claims decisions now, I think they're spelled out in the opinion.              They go both directions. That is, some say 2501 is jurisdictional, some say it's not.               Did Congress think that Rule 8(c) has no range of application?                  And -- we have two recent statements saying statutes of limitations against the government are like statutes against private parties.   But if 2501, which covers all of the cases over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction -- if, if it's for jurisdictional, then I don't know what cases there would be in which there's a time limit in a suit against the government that isn't jurisdictional.               But we do know the CFC is at least confused because they have some cases going one way and some cases going the other way.                   And from the government's point of view, the government can be relied on to raise the statute of limitations, I suppose, but aren't there cases where the government would really like to get the substantive issue settled?                   So it says, well, the statute of limitations is arguable, but we'll concede that the action was timely.               But, of course, Bowles -- I mean the Court did miss something.                     Everyone on the Court did, and that is that the period to file your notice of appeal was originally not in any statute.                        It was in the rule, the FRAP rule.               The opinions, both sides, assumed that the statute came first, and the rule was adopted to conform to the statute, but in fact it was just the opposite.        It was a rule, a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, which can't affect jurisdiction.                     We know that.   As Congress says rules of procedure don't affect jurisdiction.       So there was the rule, and then the U.S. Judicial Conference said to Congress, when it referred the rule to Congress, you might consider a conforming amendment.     And then the statute, after the rule came into effect, conformed to the rule.            So what the Court, both sides, thought in Bowles -- we just had it in reverse.               Well, Congress didn't think about it at all until the U.S. Judicial Conference said do this --               -- and the U.S. Judicial Conference wasn't thinking that thereby it became jurisdictional.                 It was addressed specifically.   It was addressed that the rule -- that the -- that all of this was statute driven.                   But the rule before -- before there was a conforming statute, you would say, well, then it wasn't jurisdictional, right?
06-1181 +++$+++                  Mr. Kneedler, why did the Government advise this Court not to grant cert on question number 1, which was:               I want to apply to reopen and simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary departure and be just like any other removable alien, take my chances just like anyone else?                     The Government said don't present that -- Court, don't consider that question.   Why?                 And it seems that this litigant said, number one, I don't want to take advantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can do so voluntarily.      The first thing I want to do is to move to reopen, withdraw my voluntary departure.                       And then the second thing was, if I can't do that, please extend my voluntary departure time while I move to reopen.   It seems that this litigant is being put in a bind by not allowing this Court to consider what was the alien's first preference, that is, to withdraw the voluntary departure.                  Why isn't the solution to withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?                  With the provision that he can get a stay.                  But then because he would then be back -- if he stays here after the period is run, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure. He is like any removable --                  But not to stay -- but he would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure. That's gone.               Which you say -- you say that under the current regime, the voluntary departure application, granted, is irrevocable.                     That's --               The regulations don't say that.     The regulations are just blank.                    It doesn't say and if you do this it's irrevocable.
06-1195 +++$+++               General Clement, I remember in a prior hearing about Guantanamo that the Government was taking the position firmly that these detainees were not prisoners of war and, therefore, were not entitled to the protection of the Geneva conventions. So if the Government is maintaining that position, these people are not prisoners of war, then the treatment of a prisoner of war is not relevant.               General --               I think, to go back to the beginning, my notion of your position was you never get to that question:      Is the review of these procedures adequate in the D.C. Circuit, because there is no authority, period, for the D.C. Circuit to engage -- to grant what is before us is if the -- our applications for a writ of habeas corpus. You say that's out the door.                They might bring some other proceedings.             I thought that was your position.               You're talking about taking the statute, Congress's statute that set up this system with limited review in the D.C. Circuit and saying that's it.     The D.C. Circuit never got to that question because it said the acts that these people are trying to bring habeas doesn't exist.                    The only thing that they have, the only remedy they have is the one that Congress provided.         And it seems to me the only question before us is whether there is jurisdiction in the court of appeals to decide that threshold issue. They tossed it out and didn't reach -- didn't say one word about the adequacy of the procedures or of the things that you're talking about.               That would be -- we would be deciding that as a court of first view because they didn't decide that?      You don't need an adequate substitute for habeas because you have no right to habeas.
06-1204 +++$+++                  I would like you to address -- you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem characterization.    That is a judgment there's a thing. But our law over the years has come to appreciate that things do not have rights; people have rights in things. So we have modified the once rigid notion that the suit is against a thing, to recognize that it's people's rights in the thing that count.              And your use of that label seems to forget about all the more recent understanding.               Did -- did the district court in Hawaii or the Ninth Circuit ever decide what the Petitioners tell us is the basic question, that is do these assets belong to the Philippine Government under that 1955 statute, or do they belong to the Marcos estate?     It seemed to me that our courts were just assuming that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate and that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were creditors of the Marcos estate.               But it didn't say, find, that:   And they belong to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government.              But isn't that what -- that's what sovereign immunity means.                     I mean, they do have the right to pick their forum.                      You say I can only be sued when I consent, so I can consent where I will. The problem with what you're presenting is it sounds like, yes, you have sovereign immunity, you don't have to be part of this lawsuit and it can't affect your rights, but then when it seems to be eventual judgment, it's a default judgment effectively against the Philippines, because they can never get those assets once they're disbursed.                     So, it's a -- it's kind of a deceptive immunity, because by asserting the immunity they are going to lose their opportunity to claim these assets.              Not necessarily.         I'm focusing on this situation.             There could be others.              I thought that the Ninth Circuit went on a statute of limitations in New York. It didn't give the sovereign immunity claim, it seems, in the end of the day any weight, because it says we don't have to worry about the Philippines being out of this case because they would have no claim on the merits.               Where is that?   Then why were they bothering with the statute of limitations? Both courts said that the action would be time barred in New York.   But if they made a definitive ruling that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate and not the Philippine Government, then that would be preclusive.               I just did not find in either the district court or the court of appeals an answer to that basic question:              Whose assets are they? It seemed to me they were assuming the assets belonged to the estate and not to the Philippine Government, but they made no specific finding on that issue.               But then you're ignoring a 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos that he didn't get legitimately belongs to the government.              Isn't that -- I mean it sounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines, as in many countries, the filing fee is determined by what you're asking for.         So it would be a percentage of $2 billion.    And if they just did that automatically, then you say, oh, but, but this -- the filing fee of that size would mean that the Plaintiffs can't sue.                  But that's -- but it wasn't they picked whatever figure, filing fee, out of a hat; it was a percentage of what was sought in the litigation right?                 Yes, they do because if they are able to successfully knock out the judgment, then they are back to square one.                Then they -- they lost on the merits, but that judgment would be wiped out.               If there was no authority of the court to proceed, then the judgment is -- is as though it were never made.               If -- if the proceeding can't go forward because of sovereign immunity, that judgment would shield Merrill Lynch from any other claim.     It could say to any other claimant:                    Sorry, a binding judgment has been issued saying this matter can't be settled without the Philippines being in it. So I don't really get your:              Merrill Lynch is going to be subject to repeated proceedings.                       They will be armed with a judgment that says, suit can't go on without the Philippines being there.
06-1221 +++$+++                  But I thought they said that it should be admitted.              I thought they went to the opposite extreme.                 How did they?
06-1249 +++$+++                   What -- can you turn to the references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made? They said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely from IV drip bags.
06-1286 +++$+++                It wasn't narrow in the beginning, right?               This is somewhat of a mystery, the wording of that clause.                     And since it came in at the very last minute, isn't it appropriate to give it a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion, that this provision that up until the very end read just administration, "costs paid or incurred in connection with the administration of the estate or trust," period?   And then there was this add-on.                    Why should we give that an expansive meaning?               Why that limitation?          Why wouldn't it say just "investment advice," but it's -- investing for total return is more limited?               It doesn't say it's one or the other.    So it's not so sure, right?                  It's sure about advice on investing for total return.                In other words, the regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this case of investment advice in general as opposed to advice on investing for total return.                They certainly weren't sure about it when they drafted this regulation, proposed regulation.                But in other categories, they express no such limitation.                Custody or management of property, not qualified.             And they -- but when you get to investing, it has that total return.                Everything else has got maintenance, repair, insurance.                 Are you saying --                 Are we saying, as a question of law, the taxpayer has the burden of proof? If it isn't a question of proof, it isn't a question of evidence?               And this must be one. The Service must think this is one because it was certain about the tax return.             It says tax return that doesn't get the subject to the 2 percent but only this kind of investment advice for total return.                    So that the Service didn't see this as a clear and certain category.
06-1287 +++$+++                 And if you limit it to the application and not the methodology, then Congress's overriding goal was there was a problem with overevaluation of the railroad's property, and Congress was responding to that problem of overevaluating the property.   But if you limit the challenger to just the application, then you are not going to have as vigorous a check on over evaluation as you would have if you could -- if you could reach back to the methodology.               I thought -- I thought you conceded that that was what it would be, because you said that the Federal court would be turned into a board of equalization, and a board of equalization is not making grand law for setting precedent.               I think what they want is to be able to attack the methodology and not be limited to the application of whatever methodology the State prefers.                  I thought both sides agreed that the unit --                  I guess the term methodology is confusing because you could think it means unit rule --                  --or you could think how under the unit rule, what is the --
06-1321 +++$+++                 Why not, given the Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to include retaliation for complaining about discrimination?              But that's -- Mr. Garre, that's traditionally when you're suing the government, you don't get a jury.      And so that's on one side. Here, as I think you would recognize, retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination claims.   A person who is discriminated against will quite commonly say:     I was not promoted because that was discrimination and then because I complained about it all these bad things happened to me.                    It's very common that those two go together. And yet, without any indication that Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress had in mind, it would be rather strange.                  But you -- I recognize it's not absurd.     But if there is ambiguity and one interpretation is, well, that in every other context retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would Congress leave out this one category of persons, especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme Court says discrimination includes retaliation?               What is the government's position?   What does, for example, EEOC or whoever passes on these complaints, what is the government's position in practice with respect to a Federal employee who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of my race and then they retaliated against me for complaining?                  Has any Federal court found otherwise?                  So you agree -- then you agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words "as applicable"?               Do we know what Congress had in mind when it said don't incorporate private sector?               There must be an explanation for that section.              What could she get -- what could she get by way of remedy?                     And you recognize that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service Act, but does have collective bargaining rights. Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.               What about -- MR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective action, Justice Ginsburg.         There is no right -- unlike Title VII, there is no right to compensatory damages under the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or emotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act is quite different.     What you typically get -- you get this under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the Age Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front pay and corrective action to -- to address the discrimination. The other way in which the Age Act, section 663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is actually another thing that makes it inherently incompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that the prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector provision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who fit within the protected class, employees over the age of 40.              Isn't the typical retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case, whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act?   That is, I think I have a solid claim of discrimination, but maybe not.              Nevertheless, once I filed that complaint, this unit doesn't like people who complain about sex discrimination, age discrimination. Therefore, I was retaliated against. In this case, isn't it the fact that the age discrimination claim, the claim of direct discrimination, was rejected and the question is but nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?                 Mr. Garre, I just want to make sure I understood something you said before, rather pleadingly.     One is if one could imagine a claim just for reprisal, but you called something a "mixed claim" if you're suing, as she started out to sue, for both. So if you're suing for both, on your theory you still must split them up?       You cannot bring the reprisal claim together with the discrimination claim?               But there's a different administrative mechanism.               Oh, oh, but how about court?                But then you -- you would be putting everything under the civil service umbrella and nothing under the --                But if it didn't amount to an adverse action under the Civil Service Act --                And you wouldn't get to court.                Yes, but it would not be within your control.      It would not be up to the --               Wasn't there -- there was something that was said about this -- that doesn't apply to congressional employees or White House employees, that they would have a claim of retaliation.              So why would Congress say when you -- when it's Congress that's doing the reprisal, we're going to give you a suit, but not if some other --
06-1322 +++$+++                This is where -- you're reading from where?               Is a complaint different from an intake questionnaire?                  Mr. Heytens, is it true that the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by counsel is usually done by EEOC itself?                   Is it that true?
06-134 +++$+++               Well, let's take the parking ticket that your colleague raised, that New York would make a parking ticket a lien, unpaid parking ticket a lien on all, all property.              Yes, yes.               Foreign aid --               I thought that the Federal, the 100 percent withholding, relates to taxes?               Taxes, not for parking tickets or anything else.
06-1413 +++$+++                Do you know what -- or did you know what Ohio did in the --               Well, what would you say -- I mean, we talk about apportioning income and allocating income, allocating to the commercial headquarters. What in an enterprise like this would you say is allocated to the commercial headquarters as opposed to being apportioned among all the States?               And -- and I'm not following your argument, because I thought that the argument that this was a unitary enterprise was made in the Illinois appellate court, and the appellate court recognizes that it was made, and said we are not going to reach it because we have this operational-function test?              Was there any sort of stipulation between the parties to say what each, what Lexis/Nexis was doing in Illinois, what Mead was doing in Illinois?              Let me ask you about the theory that both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court went on, this operational function test, which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I don't know any that was decided.               Did we ever have any case that turned on the operational function test to hold for the State taxing authority?              Yes.          But one of the problems with applying it as you urge here is that that would just override -- why would anyone go to the trouble of making a case under the so-called unitary business test, because the operational function test would be much easier to meet?             So --               So say you -- but you would be asking us, if you were going to go on that operational function, to take two examples that were given in Allied-Signal that are quite different from what's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when you recognize that we have never used that theory to hold for a State taxing authority in the context of a multi-state enterprise?              If Illinois -- if Ohio is, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on the theory that this entire income should be allocated to Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation, right?                There was no "it" to tax, right?                At the time of this sale of Lexis/Nexis assets, there was only one taxpayer; it was Mead.
06-1431 +++$+++                When were -- when there damages, as opposed to back pay, added as a remedy for Title VII?               So it wasn't that it was cut back, as the Chief suggested.               It's the first time ever Title VII plaintiffs were entitled to get money damages as distinguished from simply back pay?                 The interpretation was consistent with this -- was it 2005, long after those other new approach statutes, decisions were on the books.   Jackson was in 2005.
06-1456 +++$+++                  Were they concerned that this was a 20-year penalty, not what you're talking about, the person who gets -- who is the drug dealer, but all that this evidence shows is that we have a courier.   We don't even know if he knows who put the money in the car.     We don't know if he knows the -- who the person is that he's to deliver the money to. So on your theory, all you have to prove is that this defendant drove a car in which illicit money was hidden in order to get it out of the country.               No grand design.   All he is is a courier.                 That's a -- that's a lot of fancy language.      All he knows, in fact, if he's just a courier is that somebody gave him money to take this car in which drug money is hidden across the border.                  Not his design.     His design is only -- I mean, he's just a drug courier, and I think that's what -- that's a problem with your interpretation of the statute.                One can think of the kingpin having this elaborate plan, and when it gets to Mexico it's going to go into this bank and that place. But here the defendant is simply a courier, and on the government's theory anyone who transports hidden money to get it out of the country, who drives the car, just the driver, is a money launderer.               Why do you make distinctions between methods of concealment?                  And if the design is to get the money out of the country, why should it matter whether you put it in a travel bag, you put it in the glove compartment, you put it in your wallet, or you go through this elaborate disguise that we see here? What -- if what's important is getting it beyond the border beyond the reach of law enforcement in the United States, why should it make a difference how carefully it is concealed?               That's transporting to conceal.               But you're saying this statute covers both?               In your brief, you said the bulk cash statute would not apply to a courier.             Do you still take that position, that the government's choice is to indict for money laundering or nothing?
06-1457 +++$+++               But how would you -- how would you go about determining in this case?                 You said it's not the traditional cost of service, return on investment.    So how -- if you prevail, what should FERC do to determine whether this rate was fair and reasonable?
06-1463 +++$+++                 Volt involves a third party who is not party to the arbitration agreement. You have a party who is bound nonetheless invoking the Labor Commission to avoid going immediately to arbitration.     Volt is very clear.               It involves a third party, litigation involving a third party who is not bound by the arbitration agreement.                       Here you have only two parties.     They are both bound by the arbitration agreement.     I don't see how you can invoke Volt.                Litigation involving a person who couldn't be brought into the arbitration.                It makes sense to say that piece of it involving a party who can't be before the arbitrator should be -- should be -- go first.                      But here you don't have anybody who isn't bound to go before the arbitrator.     You have no third party.              You said something about that in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong. You said something about -- that the outcome of the litigation can have preclusive effect in the arbitration.    But that would be so only if the result favored the non-party to the litigation, because the non-party to the litigation cannot be bound by a judgment that would adversely affect that party's interest.     That party wasn't in the proceeding.                It isn't bound by it.      The parties to the litigation are bound by it, not the non-parties to the litigation.               A de novo right in Superior Court?               Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking at the point in which you said this in your brief.                     You said you go to the labor commission, and then you go to the Superior Court.     This is page 13 of your brief. The court is required to grant a motion compelling arbitration if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement. Well, who determines if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?                Well, we know -- this is not a mystery in this contract.              It says it in the contract, and it says it under the AAA rules.              But you phrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if the parties have executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is going to decide.   So it won't grant a motion to compel unless it determines that the parties have executed the valid and applicable arbitration agreement.                Related litigation with someone other than the parties that you bound yourself to arbitrate with.      That involved Stanford and two companies, Stanford suing two companies or -- in litigation with two companies with whom it had no arbitration agreement.              In that light, on page 43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he drafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700. I thought it is very much disputed whether he was a talent agent at all.             I thought the position was -- that your opponent is taking is that he was not a talent agent, that he didn't come under the statute.              But that's not what you said here.   You say it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent.         That's your statement.                What I just read you, this one, you said it isn't.            You say it is undisputed that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent.               And you just admitted that that is disputed.                But that's not what you represented.
06-1498 +++$+++               Wasn't -- in this case one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner had recommended against approval for this drug, and then something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was taken off the matter, and another one who approved it was put on? Isn't that the kind of thing that the FDA would want to police itself and not have State courts look into?               The question is we be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of examiners to find out what went on at the FDA?               That's been contested, and we are going to hear that case next term.               Right.        But it's been --               -- at least since the 1930's, State tort litigation of the very kind that Justice Breyer has described has gone on.                     Isn't that so?     That you -- even though the FDA has approved a drug, an injured party can say this was a defective drug, and the manufacturer says regulatory compliance. That's a defense.     And you would say it's a defense, but not a conclusive defense.               That's how -- that's how --               Well, would you say that my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was presenting his case, that this is an invigorated regulatory compliance defense, that it is more favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than the standard regulatory compliance because it says that the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless -- and then the exception that we are debating here. But it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer measure.   It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the regulatory compliance defense does not.               Ms. Zieve, how many States have a statute like Michigan's?               No other State does that?               But was there any experience with this in Michigan?                  How many years was it in operation before the Sixth Circuit decision?               Have there been many trials to test this theory that it would be disruptive, that --               The discussion in the Sixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on this --
06-1505 +++$+++               Mr. Waxman, the first part --              The way you phrased the first part, it sounded to me like you were going back to the interpretation that this Court rejected, that is, under the Age Discrimination Act there is only differential treatment, not neutral factor with a differential impact.              Still, the numbers, the way it came out, are rather startling.                   That there were 31 people who were RIF'd; and of those, 30 turn out to be over 40.              But the terms "flexibility," "criticality" -- I mean the way you described it, it sounds very mechanical, mathematical. But those terms are -- they call for some human judgment.              Well, maybe because he thought that, given the subjectivity of some of these factors, that there was at least unconscious age bias in the decisions that were made.                But that was taken out of it by Judge Jacobs when he redid it.                     He said, we were on the wrong track with business necessity.                     Business necessity is out.    It's only reasonable factor of age.              Is that --               Was Judge Pooler wrong, then?   She said, in effect:           You forfeited reasonable factor other than sex, because you didn't bring it up. You were going on business necessity.                The jury didn't hear a word about reasonable factors other than age.                   They heard about business necessity.
06-1509 +++$+++                   But if it turned out that there were earnings and profits and everything else was the same, would the Government be taking the position that the proper test is:          Was this a distribution with respect to stock?                 Suppose the government -- the corporation is rich with earnings and profits. Would the Government be saying:               Oh, aha.   So we have to go through the motions of first seeing was this a distribution with respect to stock? I thought that the idea of was it "a distribution with respect to stock" refers to was it -- was the corporation -- was there to be any quid pro quo? That is, the shareholder gets money from the corporation.   Is the shareholder expected to pay it back, or is it just that it comes out of the corporation into the shareholder's pocket with no expectation by the corporation to get it back? I thought that that's what "with respect to stock" means instead of "with respect to salary," "with respect to a loan."       That's what I thought was the understanding of the term.            Am I wrong about it?               Was there anything in the tax court at all that used the words as having any significance for this determination whether there was a tax evasion here with respect to this stock?             Was there any -- any hint that those -- those words were controlling?              In the tax court originally.    Was this a -- this was in the tax court?              This is a criminal case.              Okay.         In the trial court first.              Tell me about the civil case?   There would be a tax deficiency, and wouldn't the Government have to say what were the elements of the tax deficiency? You said in a criminal case they don't have to characterize it at all.           You just say he got -- he has money on which tax hasn't been paid, and there was a likely source of income.          But now you're in a deficiency mode, and the Government asserts a deficiency.              Doesn't it have to say what the elements of the deficiency are? And what would it say in this case?                Well, let's take this case.    Let's take this case and not some hypothetical, and where -- on the civil side -- the Government is asserting a deficiency.          Just change one thing.        The corporation is rich with earnings and profits.                What would the notice of deficiency say?                Wouldn't the Government want to take the position that this is a dividend and not something else, if that were the case?                If there were earnings and profits.
06-157 +++$+++                Mr. Pincus, I would like you to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds to me like it wasn't right.             The President needs protection at all times no matter where he goes.                    The President may be doing something that violates the establishment clause, but protection is the job, and it doesn't make any difference where the President is.                       And so your answer to the question, well, suppose he had a special protector who just took care of his religious activities?    I would still say that it's, protection is the thing.    So I don't think -- I think you didn't -- the answer you gave isn't consistent with your theory of this case.
06-1595 +++$+++                The investigation is not of her.   She's testifying as a witness.               And this is an act that's meant to protect people against discrimination in the workplace, including harassment.               This is a woman who testified truthfully -- we have to assume that because this was tossed out at the very threshold, so we have to assume that everything she alleged in her complaint is true, right?               There is no -- no dis -- then there has to be no genuine dispute as to any material fact.     That means we must take her allegations of fact as true at this point. But in any case this is a statute that's meant to govern the workplace with all of its realities. One of them was when they asked, well, why didn't you make a complaint, use whatever internal remedies are there are?          She said, because the person in this outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is the harasser.               But we have to -- everything -- for you to prevail, since there has been no trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she alleges them.               And how about taking our decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a sense made the employer's internal investigation part of the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you don't have that find of effective internal complaint and investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck on respondeat superior liability.                  If you do, then you will be shielded. So this Court's decision in those two cases seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your EEO compliance you had better have this internal complaint procedure and investigation.               What are the other arguments on summary judgment.                When you say it's not that the employer is stuck because there's a potential retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her testimony, then go ahead and discharge her.                On the other side, that attorney, there's a large disincentive.                   He hasn't got a good case.    He's not going to be paid any retainer as you might be.     And he's not going to get any counsel fees.    Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be available to a person who obviously was discharged for having her hand in the till and not because she was harassed?                No.      I meant that as a hypothetical.                What was the reason that she was -- what was the employer's reason for discharging her?                  I said if you have a really strong case of having discharged this person for cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her side of the case because she's going to lose.
06-1646 +++$+++                But it did use the language "a maximum term," not "the maximum term," which would support the government's view that the statute contemplates more than one maximum.                What about the defendant's own understanding?              In connection with one of these offenses the defendant acknowledged in court, the crime with which I am charged carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.
06-1666 +++$+++               Let me ask you about that, because if your basic point is that here is an officer of the United States that has someone in custody --              -- someone who is in jeopardy, among other things, of being tortured --                 -- that United States official has to safeguard a citizen?                 But can throw a non-citizen into the lion's den?                 Is that the instruction that the United States gives to its officers, take care of our citizens, but the rest of the world, we don't care?                 But you're making this distinction now.   Justice Kennedy asked you does -- does your case turn on citizenship, and you said citizenship is very important.                 There are thousands of noncitizens that are being held in the very same circumstance.               Well, but in the cases --               But he -- he is still within the Iraqi criminal justice system.                 He wasn't -- his case wasn't dismissed.          It was sent back for further investigation.              So what's happening in his case is he's undergoing a criminal process in Iraq; and we are holding him during that process.             So if you're not objecting to our holding him while the process is going on, what is -- what is he seeking through habeas? He -- he can't get out from under the Iraqi criminal justice system.         He is alleged to have committed crimes within Iraq.             We are holding him safe while that process is going on.              So what is the basis of his petition?              I don't get up to transfer.   This man is now under investigation in the Iraqi system.              Now, we -- transfer isn't an issue. What do you want done with him while he's subject to the criminal process in Iraq?              One distinct difference in Munaf's case:    He is undergoing a criminal process in Iraq, and Omar has also -- it is alleged that he has committed offenses in Iraq. Has no prosecution, no investigation been started with respect to Omar?
06-1717 +++$+++                What is cost?   Could you -- one could say I'm going to look at the Internet and come up with $35 dollars an hour, or you could say in the case of a paralegal there is a part of the overhead, there is the fringe benefits -- so just giving the hourly rate is deceptive of what the actual cost is to the law firm, because the law firm has to add on to determine what in fact it's paying for the paralegal, the fringe benefits and part of the overhead.                  I know you said that a few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees and costs -- and costs is very limited in the statute in 1920 -- and if you have attorney's fees and other expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than costs within 1988.      So I -- I would think that, well, EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more items.               Am I right that when this language first came in -- this is in relation to Justice Breyer's question -- there was no cap?                    When did the -- when was the cap put on?               It was.               It would be a lot of weight to be put on three little words:                    "Billed at cost."   If you just read those words, you could be the costs to the client, the cost to the law firm and then you'd have to go to this further document, the Administrative Conference document, it's rather thin I think.                I'd like to go back to a question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman. Isn't there -- doesn't it make sense to take a word like "attorney's fees" and like the word "discrimination," we have many different anti-discrimination statutes, but there has been an attempt to give that word "discrimination" the same meaning in all those statutes. And here the term attorney's fees, if it means that includes all of them, in terms of 1988, why not say every time attorney's fees comes up, that's what it's going to mean?
06-179 +++$+++               Why, Mr. Olson, is it more essential to this scheme than the new drugs?                  I would think that if everything that you said about new devices would apply in bold letters to new drugs, because the testing procedures are much longer, are they not?              Well, there's an argument that what it was intended to do was to cut out State pre-market approval, where States like California came in when there was a Federal void and said we shouldn't let the manufacturers put out whatever they'd like. Let's have a pre-market approval. And the argument is, as you well know, which was presented in Senator Kennedy's brief, that's what we meant to do with the preemption provision.                     Nothing more.               Why isn't there -- to -- to take care of that kind of hypothetical where the FDA says this isn't it, to say that kind of suit can't be brought.   But it is, indeed, mentioned that there's a category of suits that is simply saying:                Manufacturer, you didn't do what's in that pre-marketing approval? So we're kind of a backup to not doing anything in conflict with the FDA's approval.                  We're simply saying you didn't follow the labeling requirement, or you didn't follow the design submission that you --              You would say the same thing for -- for design and labeling if the manufacturer did not do what the FDA approved?              Mr. Olson, what about the argument that once you've got this very valuable pre-market approval, even though you could make that device safer, you have no incentive to do that.              You have permission to market this product as is.              Even if you know that there's a better way to do it, there's a disincentive to try to go through the process and make the change.    Why should you, when you have carte blanche to continue without making the change?                  I thought that you conceded that there would be conflict preemption, that the States could not -- either through a State agency or through a jury -- come up with a requirement that would conflict with an FDA requirement.                  Everybody agrees that far, that the States were not to be in the business of issuing PMA's.    The question is does the preemption clause mean any more than that?              Isn't it -- isn't it --              If you compared drugs, which -- I think you will -- you will concede -- go through a very arduous process, new drugs, why -- maybe you think that the same preemption applies there, although there's no preemption clause.               Did anyone -- when this preemption clause was put in the new Medical Device, did the government -- when was the government change?                Was it 2004?   The government's position, the FDA's position, was 180 degrees different --
06-219 +++$+++                But he also lost the malicious prosecution suit, didn't he?                 Didn't he bring a malicious prosecution suit?               And he lost.
06-278 +++$+++                   Can't it just say no signs when you're supposed to be learning?              But couldn't the school, couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner regulation that says you're not going to use the halls to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?              You could have reasonable rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school building.              Was there any fact finding on that?   You referred to affidavits.               Now you said that in your brief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got mileage out of his being truant that morning.             Would the case have come out differently, would you be making any different argument if he got to school on time and was released with the rest of them?             Does the case turn on the fact that he was late to school that day?               So he's not a school child, he would be playing hooky?                 Even though the law required him to be there?                 Where did he go immediately after?      He went to the school building for whatever it was, the third period of the day.               May I ask to you clarify one thing.   I initiated this line of questioning when I said I was surprised that your brief made such a big deal that he was late to school.                You would still be making the argument about the free speech right if he had diligently showed up for his math class first period in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his banner to unfurl when the torch came by?

06-376 +++$+++               This was for purposes of attorneys' fees?               Wouldn't it have been simpler if Congress just said the tax court shall have exclusive jurisdiction, instead of just saying jurisdiction?               And there is no linkage between the two, with, it's one thing to split a claim when they have common elements, but the interest abatement has nothing to do with the substantive underlying -- substantive liability?
06-413 +++$+++                 Judge Kozinski thought the reason there was no objection was that this juror came across as being pro-death penalty.                   Isn't that what he said?               Because you don't know him.               You, according to this structural error, so you have a death case, and so you have this kind of error you don't have to prove.               And then you're zeroing in on this particular juror and the colloquy, but shouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the jurors, including that there were -- what was it -- seven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause excusal?               But it does seem that this trial judge was doing a conscientious job.                     He granted five of the -- rejected five of the prosecutor's, and how many of those had been where defense counsel had objected?                 He objected in seven and in five of those --                 Well, I'm not --              Isn't the number of the page that you gave telling this is an appeal from a capital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made. So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one paragraph.    The defendant raised a host of challenges, and so there's not perfect consistency with what these two passages in the opinion.             But mustn't we take into account what this was?        It was the defense brought out every objection they probably could conceive of and they didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out this way.              In the Supreme Court. Now we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court. You said they got it wrong because they said in this paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an incorrect statement of the law because he said he would impose the death penalty where the defendant would reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement of the law. We don't know exactly what that court meant by that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington Supreme Court was basing -- I don't know how many objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a great many.               Well, my point is simply that where the court is faced with so many challenges, this particular one, there had been no objection at the trial.     So an appellate court might think we don't want to spend too much time on that one.
06-427 +++$+++                  And the fine has not been paid.   The fine.                 Mr. Blumstein, there's one feature of this that I find puzzling.                       You're making this a First Amendment case.              But you joined an association that has such, certain rules and when one joins, one agrees to abide by the rules. Nothing in the world stops Brentwood from saying this anti-recruiting rule is a really bad rule, it is unfair to us; you could have written op ed pieces about it, the school could have talked about it, the school could have urged the board of education to drop it.   Nothing stopped you from attacking this rule that you don't like.     But when you signed on, the First Amendment doesn't give you license not to follow the rules that you disagree with.                  But isn't part of what you agree to is a organization that has a certain governance structure, the people in the organization decide, and then make public to all the members of the association what the rules are and how they're going to be interpreted?                  Mr. Blumstein, you're making that distinction.           Is there -- if the association says no school in this association can invite students enrolled in other schools to its practice, that's okay? Because that's conduct, right?                If this is your statement, there's nothing to recruit for, because we don't allow it period.                  That would be okay.               It's a little odd, isn't it, that they could do -- they could take the stronger measure but not the lesser measure of saying it's available but we don't want you to broadcast it?               Is it fair to say "your coach"?     The letter was signed by your coach, not just coach.
06-43 +++$+++          That's if you equate this with aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is there a middle category between Charter, who is clearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't do anything deceptive?         But you are saying -- I thought your argument, unlike the government's argument, is that there was no deceptive device.       There was no deceptive device.    They simply aided and abetted.       But Charter said -- vendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the public.     I can't do it without you.     I've got to have those revenues that you're going to give me through these phony advertising payments at four or five times the usual rate.       But you must assume that they are now.       That's if they are -- that's if they are aiders and if there are only two categories and everyone who is not Charter is an aider and abettor, then you're right.     But if there's a middle category of people who, while not the benefited company -- the company that's trying to achieve the deception -- but made it possible for that -- for that deception to happen.       No --       In Central Bank, it was conceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act.       Here there is the charge that it did engage in deceptive acts.        Because the whole purpose of it --        Mr. Shapiro, if --        If it was communicated to investors that there had been $20 per set box over the regular price, if there had been advertising that was paid for by the very money that Charter gave, then the whole thing would have failed.        So this can work only if the vendors are silent.      Silence and not speech is what counts.    If the vendors communicate anything at all, the whole thing fails.     Was there any --     Was there any economic substance to this?     Is it true that the price that they were charging, they did not charge to other customers -- the $20 hike?     But it was --     -- a sham then, because they said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was they -- the inflationary conditions, so they had to renegotiate the contract, but didn't renegotiate with any of their other customers.       That's the essence of the scheme.     You said that they -- they are home free because they didn't themselves make any statement to investors.     But they set up Charter to make those statements, to swell its revenues -- revenues that it in fact didn't have.       That's if they are aiders and abettors, which is what Congress covered.        And I again go back to, is there another category or is everyone -- either Charter, the person whose stock is at stake, the company whose stock is at stake and everyone else is an aider?     I take it that that's your position.       It's either the company whose stock is in question or you're an aider and abettor.     Which I thought speak about aiders and abettors.     But is usually --     -- aider and abettor -- then again we get back to the question:     If there's nothing in this world other than the company that puts out the false statement and the aider and abettor --     -- and is there something in between?     But we're taking those out. We're talking about independent actors.      Does the SEC distinguish this kind of situation where silence is the essence of the thing for the deceiver, silence not speech?       Does the SEC distinguish this from aiding-and-abetting?     Could the SEC get any monetary recovery for the investors on your theory?          You say yes, it's a deceptive practice, but this belongs in the SEC's bailiwick, not in private suits?     Private suits; obviously they are seeking damages for the decline in the share price.   What could the SEC -- suppose it should take up this case -- get by way of remedy?     But there is no disgorgement here because the vendors didn't get anything.   For them it was a wash.     Well, but this case, disgorgement would not be a remedy.        You say fines, but those would be payable to the government, right?     But there would be no disgorgement relief.     What profits did the vendors get?     For them it was a wash.     They got -- what did they have to disgorge?       But did they receive something that they then disgorged?     I don't see --       I'm looking at the court of appeals decision which I thought just said that there was no deceptive device.
06-457 +++$+++                Before you do that, Ms. Brinkmann, would you tell us how alcohol is handled, because that is, as I understand it, that's by virtue of the 24th Amendment State regulation.                     Does UPS carry alcohol packages from one State to another?               But I asked the question only in response to your impossibility argument that you couldn't cope with such State regulations with respect to tobacco, when it seems you are with respect to alcohol.               How did they deal with under the New York settlement?             I take it this would be a problem under that settlement, because it doesn't touch selling from a duly licensed dealer.             And so, under the New York settlement, which operates nationwide, what does the carrier do to make sure that the recipient is a licensed dealer?              But the first condition, and the package is clearly labeled, aren't there some commodities where UPS does have to pay attention to the label?              It can't be -- Ms. Brinkmann told us that they've got these -- so many packages and it's going to cost millions.                     But they do have to do it for a package that's labeled hazardous.
06-480 +++$+++                  Even with the tremendous anomaly that the employer -- that the -- the manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that won't go along?     Those two are substitute of each other. Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have to do it on your own, and then you have to do the draconian thing of terminating the dealer.              Mr. Coykendall, the -- on the question -- you alleged in the complaint that there was some discounting allowed by, how do you pronounce it, Leegin?              Leegin.       And Mr. Olson says that that wasn't pursued at trial; is that correct?                Suppose you were to lose, you would still have that claim, I take it?               As Mr. Olson pointed out, under the fair trade laws this was per se legal.               So that's kind of a different thing.                Maybe on the year by year, don't spend any money on, maybe Congress decided that wasn't an appropriate technique, but Congress has used that after, hasn't it, in other cases?
06-484 +++$+++                 Well, let's take one specific example that the petitioners did, and that is this matter of the channel stuffing.                      They say here's a notion, channel stuffing.            It could mean goods were shipped that nobody ever ordered, or it could mean something different.      It could mean discounting and other incentives to get people to buy.                  So there's good channel stuffing and bad channel stuffing, and it sounds like good cholesterol, bad cholesterol; you can't tell from the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's at issue.
06-5247 +++$+++               You said in your brief that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should have sought cert -- direct review from the State court's conviction.    Did you say that?              But realistically, the likelihood that such a petition would be successful, passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would grant cert on such a question is very slim.               It was two to one in the Ninth Circuit.               Judge Rawlinson I think said that using the Brecht standard, that there was actual prejudice.               At what point, how many weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?                 But on the other side, State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.              I thought the AEDPA question was out of it because that hasn't been -- there was no cross-appeal on that question.                    I thought it was a given, a given in this case, that the California courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly established Federal law. I didn't think that was an issue in the case.   I think we took it on the assumption that it was such an error.               It's not raised here. There was no cross-appeal from that.               That's because there were many, many issues raised.
06-5306 +++$+++                What type of jurisdiction are you speaking of?      It's certainly not Federal jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal law.   What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?               The provision of, is it 2107?               Where does that appear in the judicial code?      Does it appear under the provisions concerning jurisdiction?                 But it is under the heading procedure, court procedure, right?                 Yes, but that's under a chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to jurisdiction.                 You know there have been a spate of cases that said the word "jurisdiction" has been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings.                         And you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity, is there a federal question?              But amount in controversy is in 1332.    Congress putting it right there together. It says diversity of citizenship plus amount in controversy, all in 1332.           Here the limit appears in a statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.                How far do you take it? Suppose this ^   slip is not noticed in the court of appeals, and then there's a petition for cert, and some clever law clerk notices that the notice of appeal was filed in 16 days instead of in 14 days.                      Would the court then have to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?              I thought what we were talking about was that if the order had said 14 days instead of 17, then the act would have been properly done.   That is, the only reason that -- the 16 days, according to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days was the judge authorized that.              If the judge hadn't authorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded and he would have filed in 14 days.              Justice Breyer quoted from the Osterneck case.         There was another statement of the rule which goes like this:              There is a sharply honed exception covering cases in which the trial judge has misled a party who could have and probably would have taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct rather than incorrect information.                 This case fits right into that description, doesn't it?                The case that I'm reading from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against United States.   It does cite Thompson.                But they would have filed that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said, your motion for a new trial is untimely.                     It seems to me the same as in this case.          The judge said:             Your motion is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much later.    Fine.   If the judge had said, your motion is untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of appeal in sooner rather than later.                       Similarly, here the judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later. If the judge had done right and said the 14-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed within that period.                There was nothing in Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.               Mr. Stewart, do you think this is subject -- that question is subject matter jurisdiction?
06-531 +++$+++                I thought this court said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to put on a demonstration that would be like the plays, that would be hidden from public view because you have a curtain or whatever around it.               And then the judge said, oh no, that's not what they wanted, they didn't want it to be hidden from you view, they wanted people to see their demonstration, so if that's what they want to do, they don't have any First Amendment protection.                Let's stay with this case because your interest is in getting fees in this case. Suppose you had lost the preliminary injunction and then you won at the end of the line.                Certainly you would be prevailing throughout, right?               Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction?               That parsing, is there any doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout, that you would get your fees for your entire representation?               Not that.     But would you not get -- would the judge say you don't get a penny for the effort you made to achieve the preliminary injunction because you lost, you lost it, even though in hindsight I could see that that was the wrong decision, you should have had it?               They're obviously related.    It's the same thing.             I need -- I have a short time to answer the preliminary injunction.               The judge said:   You haven't shown probability of success on the merits, or denies it.       You win.          I thought that there wasn't any doubt that you could get your fees for the successful result from the time you filed the complaint until the final judgment.                 Where -- can you -- I thought what he said was -- I thought they wanted a demonstration that was going to be secure from public view, and instead I understand now that's not -- that wasn't what they wanted from the start. So on the premise on which I was operating, I was right, that they were going to do it just like the plays.   But what they really planned to do, and did do, I was wrong because those facts were not before me.              Had those facts been before me, they would have lost on the preliminary injunction.                 But that was also a -- that was the demonstration or the show arrangement under the -- was it the Brooklyn Bridge or the Williamsburg Bridge?                 At 6 a.m.              You get costs?      The phrase is "attorney's fees as part of costs".               So, do you get costs for up to the preliminary injunction?              So you would split the costs?              So this defendant, having succeeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't get costs for the whole case; is that what you're telling me?              So they were entitled to costs for the entire case?               And attorney's fees under the statute are to be awarded as part of costs?               So if you're not entitled to costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how do you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute puts them together?     Because attorney's fees are part of costs.               But this wasn't --               This was one that the state got all of its costs from your client?
06-5618 +++$+++                  Mr. Dreeben, if we could focus on the facts of this case and what the district court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality judgment, too.   She said this is a young man.             It's his first offense.   He has a good family relationship, a good work record.    I am making a determination that will put him away for a significant amount of time.              But I'm trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away. That was the judgment that she made.               She tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15 months, but that would not be so long that it would put him out of touch with his children and his wife and his work. Now, in -- by some measures that would be entirely reasonable.       But on your measure, it isn't reasonable.               But you did leave out what -- she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I would be throwing him away.              And I take it what she was saying by that is it would be -- he would be incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate into the community.
06-562 +++$+++                But to talk about the other polluter or the other in this case, where the other polluter is not someone who is going to settle because it's the Government itself --               So I don't think you're in a position to concede anything one way or another because that's not your case.               What about the Government's concern that prenups shouldn't go on unsupervised.   That's when EPA brings an enforcement action, there's a monitor there.               When there's a settlement, then the Government is there.                  But if you just go off on your own and do this, you're doing it unsupervised by any State authority, any Federal authority, and that could --              What about the disincentive to settlement?             You just said how important settlement was, or what a good thing it is to encourage it.   But the Government says if you could just clean up without any order and without making any proposed settlement, just do it and get back your costs, then there's a powerful disincentive to settle.
06-571 +++$+++                May I ask --                 It was -- Watson possessed the gun, would you agree with that, in furtherance of the transaction?              Would you say that this case fits the statute, as amended, so it could have been charged as possession?               Why was it -- why wasn't possession charged here?              But the prosecution would certainly want to assure the success of the argument; and if this is clearly possession, why wasn't possession charged?   And does the Department of Justice give any guidance to prosecutors since the 1988 amendment on what to charge in these situations?               But -- but Smith, in Smith, Justice O'Connor used the illustration turning currency into a cannon.        You can't do that very well if the gun is in a car, in a locked trunk in a car on the street.   You can't turn the currency, the gun, into a cannon.
06-5754 +++$+++                Mr. Dreeben, may I ask you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised? I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates a district court sentence, that there is no presumption that binds the district judge. But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran made in his presentation was the district judge has to give reasons.   He -- this was just a summary paragraph at the end of the sentence hearing.                      He has to respond to what defendant presented.             He has to respond to what the Government presented.           There is an obligation stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that the court of appeals has used.               Reasons weren't given for it.
06-593 +++$+++                Mr. Becker --               Mr. -- Mr. Becker, if there is room for the Agency to read this statute either way, one way that the third party employee would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they would not, would be treated the same way as the person employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to end up being the householder paying for it anyway. So why isn't the most reasonable interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption that the exemption would apply across the board, so that all workers in this category would be exempt?
06-618 +++$+++                That would go for a stenographer in a committee hearing?               Have any cases gone through a district court on the merits under this Act?               Have any cases under this Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?
06-6330 +++$+++                And then are you saying that either the guidelines are out of it and the statute controls, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has, in effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting the drug quantity, made that mandatory?                  That guideline -- I mean, it sounds to me that if you must adhere to the 100 to 1, then that's a mandatory guideline.
06-637 +++$+++ 
06-6407 +++$+++                This would mean that in every first Federal habeas, no matter how farfetched, every single Federal petitioner has to bring a Ford claim.    Otherwise he won't have it at the end of the road.     Has to burden the district judge with this that is frivolous because it's so far premature.                     But that's what you're saying, Congress -- the statute can be read only that way, to say that the Ford claim has to be made even when there's no basis for it, even though it couldn't be handled by the district judge.
06-666 +++$+++                  Why is it any different from a tax credit?               What about the example that was given of a interstate compact, say, to operate a port authority that covers a few States, and the compacters agree that they are not going to tax the income on bonds issued by the port authority, but they are going to tax the income from out-of-State municipal, but it's only the bonds from this port authority.                So they -- it seems your theory would reach that too.               And yet Congress has approved compacts that say just that.                The Court, in that old Bonaparte case, it was just kind of very naive because the Court made a decision that didn't -- that State A can't create bonds that are going to be exempt from tax in other States, right?
06-6911 +++$+++                Everyone in this case. The point might be arguable in a case that involved that domestic violence statute. Everyone in this case.                 This case doesn't involve that other provision.                There are cases in the pipeline that don't think it's as clear as day.                Yes.
06-694 +++$+++                 What about "present"? The word "pandering" itself is not used in the statute. It uses a lot of words, "promote" and "advertise" -- well, maybe that's just redundant.                   I guess that would be the government's position -- but "present," "distribute" -- what else?                And rewrite -- and essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed. This Court is not generally in the business of writing appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we put those contours around it.             Certainly the Court could write an opinion that would inform Congress why this particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad. But for the Court itself, I think that that -- I don't know any instance in which we have provided that kind of appendix that said things that are like Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like something else are not okay.            I don't know.                  Do we see them getting prosecuted in any state?              I asked you have there been such cases?    A lot of states have pandering laws now, and is the case that you posit a case that has occurred in any of those states?              Maybe that's because the quantity of material has increased.              The only thing that limits the statute is the First Amendment.                 What else -- you say it may not be covered by the First Amendment. What else gives you a right to challenge the statute?
06-713 +++$+++                 Where does that right come from?     I thought in Jones, the Court had said if you had just a blanket primary, with no indication of party affiliation, that that would be constitutional. And if that's so, then parties don't have any right to have a candidate.                So you would have no objection if this - everything was the same, except no party affiliation were shown.                That would be constitutional?               How does one associate -- this one -- I think General MCKenna told us that in the State of Washington people do not register membership in one party or the other, so how does the Republican Party determine who is a Republican?              No, who do you consider a member of the party?      If you say I am a Republican in the State of Washington, what does that mean?                It doesn't mean I registered Republican because Washington doesn't register people by party.              Any one of those, contributing funds is enough?             You don't have to go to the convention if you are --
06-7517 +++$+++                  Couldn't you have asked at the hearing, couldn't you ask the judge:                     Judge, please have a continuance here because you have taken us by surprise and we'd like to offer some evidence that you -- that might influence you?                 When?         I asked Mr. Madden and didn't get a precise answer:                 When does this notice have to be given?     We're told that the court itself did not get the full sentencing packet until seven days before the hearing. So when must this notice be given and how much does it have to say? Well, it's -- it's a                 But you think that this case is a poor example because you're urging us to apply the harmless error rule and say this case would have come out the same way --                 If we -- if we grant the review so we can resolve the question, does the judge have to give notice or not?               And if she has to give notice, what time?      What content? But now you're urging us to say -- to do something that ordinarily this Court doesn't do, that trial judges do, to deal with harmless error, which would be spending our time on this very particular case setting no law for any other case?              But then it would be easy for a district judge to escape any obligation to give 32(h) notice because he could simply say:               Oh, yeah, before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a) factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore.              Why isn't it just whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that reason is, just say it.         So the judge says -- could say here, "I'm contemplating going outside because I don't think that this man is going to stop these threats." Period.   That's all.
06-766 +++$+++               But Storer --                Could a State decide it doesn't want candidates to have any part in this delegate-selection process?              It thinks it's unseemly to have would-be judges engage in that kind of activity. So it structures the system that says that they choose delegates for a convention, but we don't want those delegates to be the delegates of any particular candidate.     We want to insulate this process from would-be candidate influence.               Would that be unconstitutional?               That's the -- that's the remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was -- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be chosen by primary.                There's also one view, I think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst thing in the world would be to return us to the primary system this system was intended to replace.
06-7949 +++$+++                I'm sure that the prosecutor argued that, and the judge heard it, and he listed what thought were the key factors. You made a distinction between a sentence could be rational but not reasonable.                     And I'm accustomed to understanding rationality review as equivalent to reasonableness review, but you made a distinction between those two.                So I get your idea of rationality passes the lunatic test.                      What is reasonableness?
06-8120 +++$+++               The fact that the action --               Mr. Zall, let's say we have just an intelligent reasonable person reads the newspaper and says:       Oh, they handed down a decision today that said the police can order me to get out of the car, the police can order me to stay in the car. How could such a person feel free to leave knowing that it is the law that that person can be told, get out, or if he tries to get out, stay in?               It may be that you can walk away, you're not in an enclosed space.             Suppose the passenger knows when the police approaches:             Oh my goodness, I didn't buckle up.             Would that passenger be the object of the police authority from the start?               So it could be, it could be sometimes the attention is directed at the driver, but that's not always the case.               But the question that's presented is kind of a standing question.                     It's who can complain when the police stop a car?                     You say the driver.    The question that's been presented in this case is, can the passenger also complain, and that's the only thing that we're dealing with.               So the -- the arrest warrant may pose a disqualification for this particular passenger, but that would be a second question.                        The question that is tendered to us and that was answered by the California Supreme Court is when the car is stopped by the police who can complain.
06-8273 +++$+++               That's not the point.    I thought that Teague was driven not by some abstract notion about finality, but the intrusion on State decision-making.   Here was State that had conducted an entire process that appeared to be in line with what the Federal law then appeared to be.               And then the State is told by some Federal habeas court, State, you've got to do it all over again, because you didn't -- you didn't predict that we were going to interpret the Constitution differently.   I thought that the really motivating idea of Teague was it addressed the Federal forum and said, Federal forum, don't step on the States' toes, don't make them redo trials that have long since been over.               That was not a question addressed to you, Mr. Diamond.               You do recognize, though, that one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why we changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for State courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy hand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do. It seems a little ironic then if you take an opinion that was driven by the Feds staying out of the State courts' territory to say oh, no, we're going to tell you that it's not -- we control when we want to.              -- State executives can upset all those expectations.             The State executive says I want this -- the issue -- the substantive issue in this case settled, so I'm not going to raise Teague. And so Crawford is going to be retroactive because I say so.   It is a bit of an anomaly that the prosecutor has that power but not the State court itself.               It is also difficult to see what Federal interest is vindicated when the State says we know we have to respect this -- call it what you want -- new precedent in cases still in the pipeline, and we don't have to if the case has reached a final judgment.   But "not required to" doesn't say "can't, even if you want to."               Could a -- could a State say:   We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment, is out.   Stone v. Powell says when it's -- when you go through the direct process, that's the end of your raising a search-and-seizure claim. Could a State say:              Well, we know the Fourth Amendment is binding on us under the Federal Constitution, but we think that we should extend the Fourth Amendment, right, not only to cases on direct review but to collateral review as well? Federal habeas courts can't do it, but could States?
06-84 +++$+++                This is a different question.    We've been talking about willful up to now.              You haven't addressed adverse action at all.              Yes.          But, was there anything further on willful?             You said that the statute was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice, but now we know that courts have divided on this question, right?    On --
06-856 +++$+++                Russell was about a welfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the plaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that she didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because she did get those, she wanted straight out damages, compensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the receipt of benefits.     That's quite a different thing from saying I want the contributions made so that I will get the benefits to which I'm entitled.               So then you would agree that (a)(1)(B) is not available?               But what is the plan other than a collection of individual --                      I mean the trustee is the trustee for the plan.                      All of the assets are there.     The individuals do not have them in their pockets.     So the trustee is managing this fund, which is then segmented into accounts for each individual.                      So I think your -- your suggestion is that these defined contribution plans, they come out entirely because -- because of the segmented accounts.                   So you could never bring a claim because it would always be an individual.                 Yes, but you said -- you said it doesn't have to be every single member of the plan.                 You said it has to be more than one.    How then do we read the statute to say, well, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because there may be some people that are not entitled to this? How do we get that number between more than one and less than everybody?                 But I'm -- I'm asking you just -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to bring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to involve every member, every contributor to this defined contribution plan.      But it has to involve --                  -- more than one.    So that's the question I'd like to you address.               You recognize that there can be a claim against the fiduciary for breach of trust on behalf of contributors to the plan?     So in that lawsuit, how many people would there have to be to qualify?              You say not everybody, but more than one.                  For example.              What?         What other remedies?              But you said this isn't -- you said it isn't a claim for benefits.                     It's a clam for lost profits.    You said that a few times.                  I thought (a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.              I know, because in making this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B) -- I thought you were arguing -- what did you say the remedy for this person would be?    Assuming it's true that he put in his slip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the trustee missed it, lost it?              What is his remedy?              Is that what you argue in your brief?               So what did you argue is his remedy, in your brief?               What would that be?               He didn't know until he got the report.               But it's much too late. It's over and done.     It wasn't made.              Let's take, because this case was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are forms to fill out and says I want this set of investments as opposed to that set of investments.                   The contributor fills out that form, gives it to the fiduciary.   A careless employee for the fiduciary loses it, and that's the story.          So what's the remedy for the contributor who gave his instruction that weren't followed, not out of anything deliberate but just carelessness?              Enjoining him to be careless?              If you say I want these funds invested in this particular set of shares for this period, for this six-month period, then two years later you can have that trade made?             I don't understand it.                 And never available in a court of law.               Well, then what is it? It's got to be something.               This isn't like a cleanup.
06-9130 +++$+++               Why wasn't it federally funded?   I thought there was a provision for indemnification.               You have a difference with Mr. Andre on the extent to which other law enforcement officers assist customs and revenue agents. In your brief you say that's a rare occurrence.                  And Mr. Andre says oh no, it's quite common.                  So which is it?                 I know your time is running out, but I would like you also to say a word about what remedy, if any, does Ali have when you're saying he had his prayer rug and Koran, and the government lost them and he didn't get any compensation? Does he have any remedy?               But there's no court -- there's no court role in that process.
06-923 +++$+++               And what would -- how would you verbalize it?              Because everybody talks about yes, it's a factor, it's a relevant factor.                    But if you are writing an opinion to give clear instructions to the district judges who are the first-instance judicial decisionmakers, what do you tell them? I would say first and              Why --              If we look at Firestone, it's rather laconic.        It's just says -- it says, ordinarily, if you don't have this discretionary authority, it's de novo review.                And then -- this is on page 115.   It says if the fiduciary has discretionary authority to determine eligibility benefits, then it's not de novo.    And what more does it say?                I don't see that it says anything more than that.

06-984 +++$+++                 That's after there's a breach, but we -- let's stick to the protocol, the Optional Protocol -- optional.                 The protocol says: We accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ.     "Jurisdiction" means power.                We agree that in cases of this character, Vienna Convention violation cases, we submit to the jurisdiction of X tribunal, the ICJ. What is there that needs execution about that?     Congress said yes, the United States, the Executive Branch of the United States decides that it's a good idea to submit to the -- to the jurisdiction of the ICJ.     We ratify that. And I don't see anything left for Congress to do.     It said   the United States can submit to the jurisdiction of the ICJ.               Well, I still -- I would like to get back to that Optional Protocol.              It -- was it submission to jurisdiction?              My understanding is that any two parties that can agree, can have a formed selection clause, can agree that we accept the authority of this tribunal, and then it follows from that that if you accept their authority to adjudicate, you are bound to follow its decisions.         And that that seems to be understood in the world community because, is it not so that even though there are cases like Nicaragua and Iran, most ICJ judgments are indeed complied with by the nations that agree to submit to the jurisdiction of that tribunal?                Do you have a case that says that?     A Mexican case that says that?                Maybe it hasn't come up.              But --              Mr. Cruz --              Are you saying that even --              Then we couldn't have a treaty with another country on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgment, because the other country might get it wrong, we might disagree with its interpretation of the law, and, therefore, unlike the rest of the world, the United States can't get the advantage of a reciprocal guarantee that our judgments will be respected, and in turn we will respect your judgment.               It may be that if the case turns on a question of U.S. law, and we may think, as many think about the ICJ, that they got that question wrong.   Still, it's always been if you don't look behind the judgment.   You say in the next case I'm certainly not going to apply that wrong interpretation. But here I'm bound by a judgment. And that's why I questioned your use -- your heavy use of Sanchez-Llamas.            I agreed with the court in that case because it was a question of interpretation. We don't have to agree with the ICJ.                    We were not faced with a decision, a binding adjudication, which we accept for that case only.     So there's a difference between Sanchez-Llamas and this case that you appear not to recognize in your brief.                I thought you said that -- oh, you said that this is a matter of goodwill or that most ICJ judgments -- ICJ judgments, they're not binding but people comply -- nations comply with them as a matter of goodwill?                What could -- other than -- I mean, the most logical place to have this go on is the court that rendered the judgment.               It's always better for the court that rendered the judgment than some foreign court or another State court. So what else could the President do?                 The ICJ did say U.S., as a matter of your own choosing.                     And the President chose the most logical forum, but what else could he have done?                Let's start with the first one.   Why should this case be in Federal court? It's a state judgment that's in question.                But you can have the Federal court overseeing the State court and telling the State what to do?     That seems to me practically much more of an encroachment on State authority than to say, State courts, you do it.                -- or to say Federal courts, you do it.                  Who would be doing the review?                  A law passed by Congress saying Texas dispense with your procedural bar rules?                 So what's absent in your view is Congress.    You say that all of this could have been done --                 -- and Texas could have been ordered, but the President doesn't have the authority to do it just on the basis of the ICJ,               The not self-executing in the position of the State Department, wasn't there -- in the parallel proceedings in Oklahoma, wasn't there a letter from the current -- the then current legal adviser telling Oklahoma that this is a judgment that's binding on all courts in the United States, State and Federal, and that the President has directed Oklahoma to comply?   I think that was sent both to the governor and the other officials.               Which -- which letter are you quoting?   Are you quoting --              Yes, there is.         We have interpreted the law, and we have said as far as what Article 36 means, we disagree with the ICJ.              And Oklahoma has taken the opposite position, and they -- they did give the review and reconsideration?               And has any other State acted?               I thought the ICJ flatly refused Mexican -- Mexico said ICJ annulled the judgment.     The ICJ said no, and it didn't vacate it, either.     It just said that it did a reconsideration to see whether there was prejudice.               Their very own statute, the statute setting up the ICJ, makes it clear that is not the case.     They can issue a binding judgment in the particular case.     It has no precedential effect for other cases, not even within the ICJ.               Has that ever happened?                 And the U.S. exercised its veto.
06-989 +++$+++                What about public policy? That was the other one Mr. Phillips brought up.               Miss Brinkmann, can we back up a bit, because this agreement had an usual genesis.     This was a big case, and the judge kept right in the court a piece of it.              And then he and the parties agreed that another piece of it would best be resolved in arbitration.     So the judge was in equal participation in that effort.     All three parties wanted to get a particular issue resolved through an arbitrator rather than the court, itself. And I doubt very much whether the judge would have been at all interested in that scheme if he thought he were doing an idle thing.                      That the parties, having agreed to just what the judge thought was a nice way to resolve this issue, would then find themselves out of Federal court and have to bring some kind of suit in State court.     It doesn't seem to fit this scenario.                 Why not use -- why not use Rule 16, pretrial procedure, and the parties and the judge can work out what they think is the most efficient way to resolve this controversy?                 So they decide at the pretrial conference that they are going to build into this arrangement one issue that they are going to peel off to go to an arbitrator, but the judge is going to retain control through the legal error.               That's a strange argument in this respect.     You are arguing that this non-Article III person has more control rather than less control; that if the judge controlled this arbitrator, somehow that would violate Article III. But if the judge has no control and is essentially little more than a rubber stamp on what the non-Article III person does, then that's all right.                   And the sense of that doesn't come across to me.              Are there any --              Are there any -- are there any such States left today that are using the Illinois model?                  Is there a possibility that the reason the language in the statute is as it is -- when was the Federal Arbitration Act; what year was it?               And there was still abroad in the land considerable distrust of arbitrators. Judges said arbitrators are stepping on our turf, and so they would be naturally resistant to let the arbitrator go ahead and have the most minimal review in court. Maybe the act was written the way it was to say, if the parties want to go to arbitration, courts, you stay out of it.              Is that what --               Well, let's take this statute and let's take the circuits that have the rule, the opposite rule.      In fact, the Ninth Circuit had the opposite rule until rather recently.                      What has been the experience -- I think the Fifth Circuit is on the other side?               What has been the experience there?               I think a lot of those horribles, Mr. Phillips would agree with you because he hesitated even on de novo, and I think he thought that trying to control an appeal from the district court, that would be out of the ballpark.                 But one problem that I have with your position is you say that the -- you should continue to prevail, although that would be in violation of the parties' agreement.                     Under the Ninth Circuit decision, you win, what the arbitrator says goes, and there isn't the review that the parties bargained for.
07-1015 +++$+++                Are you suggesting General Garre's statement he just made to us -- he said there's nothing in the Office of the Inspector General's report that suggests that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI were engaged in any wrongdoing?               What is the statute of limitations that would apply?               You have -- you have not had discovery from the Attorney General or --               So --               So it's -- it's as though discovery with respect to those two defendants was stayed pending your discovery from the lower level defendants?              Has it?              Wasn't it limited to people who were already indicted on other charges?              We're not dealing with the universe of men who are of a certain national origin; we are dealing with only ones who were incarcerated for an offense that has nothing to do with terrorism.
07-10374 +++$+++                Ms. Underwood, there is a feature of this case, even assuming that you were right about -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from its courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited, taken away, one mode of relief.                That is, you can sue a correctional official for declaratory relief, you could sue for injunctive relief.            All New York has taken away is one mode of relief.         That's not jurisdictional unless you say that every element of damages is jurisdictional. New York allows this type of claim in their courts.    We are talking about jurisdiction over the person?    Yes, they have jurisdiction over the correctional official's person.                Subject matter -- subject matter is a 1983 case?                Yes.        All they are cutting off is one form of relief.                 Practically -- practically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer on its correctional officers absolute immunity, not merely qualified immunity?            So if you want to be realistic about what is the effect of New York's law, it says you are going to be subject to equitable relief, declaratory relief, but as far as money is concerned, you are absolutely immune.                 What's the difference of -- practically?                 Isn't the -- isn't the practical effect -- if you tried to explain to correctional officers what is your exposure, you would say:   You have absolute immunity from anything that's going to try to reach into your pocket.                 I thought the theory was that in our Federal system, Federal law is State law, too?   That is the highest law for a State.                 Federal law by virtue of the Supremacy Clause is State law; and sometimes Congress creates an exclusive Federal jurisdiction over certain types of claims.                  But if Congress doesn't do that, the assumption is there is concurrent jurisdiction.               I thought that in Testa the State said we are evenhanded, we don't bring -- we don't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the civil side of our court?
07-10441 +++$+++                  Well, what about Rule 5? And Rule 5 doesn't say a word about voluntary.                    It says unnecessary delay -- shall be brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay.                    So whatever the balancing there may be in 3501, I think what you're saying is that Rule 5(a), which just says bring theoretically before a magistrate without unreasonable delay, that that has no teeth; that that is effectively unenforceable.              Rule 5 is about unnecessary delay, and here we have a case, if I remember the facts right, where the officer said, yes, the reason we didn't bring him before a magistrate sooner is because we wanted to get a confession from him.                You are really asking the Court to overrule MCNabb-Mallory, because you say Congress provided six hours, no MCNabb-Mallory, but after six hours the test is voluntariness -- only voluntariness.   So there's nothing left under the government's view of MCNabb-Mallory.               That's Rule 5.               And as you have said without the exclusionary rule, Rule 5(a) has no teeth at all.   And I agree with that.           It says -- it's a straight out command, no unnecessary delay.                 And isn't the reason for 5(a) exactly what happened here?                    This was a case where the police officers were trying to admit that the sole reason that they didn't bring Corley before a magistrate properly was to extract a confession.                That's exactly what MCNabb-Mallory was trying to --                  Is there any indication of the rules advisory committee, any of their notes, that 402 was meant to overturn MCNabb-Mallory?
07-1059 +++$+++ 
07-1090 +++$+++                But this statute specifically short-circuits that process.                  It says the President may at once make inapplicable.                  The very purpose of it is that the normal process is going to take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.                  But why -- why shouldn't we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act said Congress is setting the rules.                   But why doesn't this emergency measure effectively restore to the President under these special circumstances the power that he once had?     Congress ceding back to the President back to the President for the purposes of dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control authority he once had?               But, Mr. Goldstein, before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what you think about the claim for relief.                    The D.C. Circuit said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it doesn't provide a private right of action; the new statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq.                    So, what was the source of the claim -- what is the source of these plaintiffs' claim for relief?               Which -- which State law?               So that -- by that reasoning, people all over the world could sue the United States in their courts alleging that the United States has engaged in cruel and inhuman treatment with respect to their nationals.             The same theory would apply -- use the law of the state where the national comes from.    So, it could be Iraq, could be Belgium, could be Yemen -- any place.      So -- but the claim you are saying exists would be a kind of universal one, if it's -- the United States could use it, any other place in the world could, too.              No.      Looking to their own law.               I did, and you can --               You can go back to your jurisdiction argument.               Congress could pass a law. (Laughter.)
07-1114 +++$+++                  But what about the prosecutor who said "baloney."               He said the prosecutor -- the prosecutor says:         The defendant tells you he was a drug user.    Baloney, he was a drug dealer. The prosecutor deliberately tried to paint this man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs, which he did, and he was dealing in them.                      I mean the -- the prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a cold- blooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision. And that line to the jury, "baloney" -- he says he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is exactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, which is to tell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug abuser.               Spell out the waiver in light of what he said.      The first time he learns that these -- cases, other cases cited and he has access to the district attorney's file, he then files a habeas, State habeas petition in which he said that the facts on which his Brady claim rests have been revealed through disclosure of the State's files which occurred after the first conviction proceeding.           Those words are in the affidavit -- right -- that came with the second petition.   So how could he possibly have waived this when he has explained it wasn't available to him?
07-11191 +++$+++              But it doesn't have to happen in the prosecutor's case.             In other words, the prosecutor puts in the reports and rests.              And the defendant says, there wasn't sufficient evidence; I move to dismiss the case.         It couldn't be dismissed at that point.   The prosecutor would prove its case by the affidavit alone.
07-1122 +++$+++                But that's not -- Mr. Parkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime is afoot.    It justifies this stop, and then you have to have something further to justify the pat down, but the car, the seizure of the car and its passengers, that is the equivalent of the first Terry.               And why isn't that so?    It's a stop; it's a legitimate stop.               And then don't you lose under that line of cases?         This is the picture that the officer was painting, or I thought was, to bring this within the "Mind if I search your luggage" category of cases.               So -- she's got consent. She doesn't have to -- she says, he said okay, he would get out and talk to me; he said okay when I began to pat him down; it's only in the middle of it he began to wriggle a little bit.               How could he not be dangerous?     First, she said:           I suspected him because he was looking behind, but -- and then she said he was wearing the clothes of a gang, and then he admits to having been convicted of a burglary.                    Why isn't it very normal for a person to be apprehensive?
07-1125 +++$+++               Would you go over that again?    I didn't understand it.             You said Title IX provides --              -- against sex discrimination than the Constitution does.              Explain that to me.              Give me an example.              And what would the standard be under 1983?               But they didn't go on the issue of preclusion.        If they had done that, it would be a different case.     They said that Title IX is preemptive of 1983.     And they cited the cases where -- like Smith against Robinson where that is what the Court held.               But you -- you must, I think, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress set up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is quite different from what this Court did.                    It just said there is a private right -- right of action.                    There is an implied private right of action. It didn't set up any administrative mechanism.   It didn't set up any regime for going to -- to an agency first and then coming to the court, none of that.               Do you have any case in all of Title IX that -- that fits that abstract picture that you have just described?               I mean you have to have a pattern and practice of what -- a pattern and practice of discrimination -- to get -- to get under the Constitution or under 1983? You have to have deliberate indifference to what:     To the gender harassment, to the gender discrimination?     So can you describe to me that -- anything, any Title IX case, that has a disparate impact?     We really didn't want a Feeney type of case. We really didn't want this to happen but we had a test, and it came out that way.                Can you describe a Title IX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we didn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really didn't want it at all, but it happened?                On the basis of gender.                And Feeney says it wasn't on the basis of gender.         It was on the basis that she wasn't a veteran.               But there is -- you are leaving out something quite glaring in that respect. For example, single sex schools, military academies, admissions to elementary and high schools, are not covered by Title IX.                Wouldn't your reasoning apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment? We have got title VII and you have 1981.                Title VII has a lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through; 1981 is plain and simple.          So therefore, title VII ought to preempt 1981, right?        So you -- in the area of race discrimination and employment, title VII would end any access to 1981.   It would be the same kind of argument, wouldn't it?               What does that have to got to do with what you are arguing is that if you have an elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under Title IX, I think that is debatable?                    But that was certainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in Title VII, Title VII versus 1981.                That -- that fits your -- the -- your description, Title VII and 1981, much better than Title IX and 1983, I think.              There was no constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.                  I thought you just said that a deliberate indifference under both statutes, under 1983 and Title IX.               Then you wouldn't have gender discrimination.               Response to what? Response --                 So you wouldn't have -- if you work for a municipality and your boss has been harassing you, you would not have a case under 1983?                You were saying the constitutional standard is different, so I am just giving you a case.      It could be a school, it could be another municipal employment.
07-1209 +++$+++                   Does the -- the notice can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons case, or notice could be given but it's defective.                 It can be defective in a major way, it can leave out -- you said Congress recently required a more detailed notice. Do we treat all those like, as long as the notice doesn't measure up fully to their statutory requirement, then the veteran goes back to square one?                 And so, you wouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice was not given at all, and the case where the notice was given, but it was incomplete?               Your case is one where the veteran did get what they call the first level notice.               So Justice -- the implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your client would lose, because your client did get the first level notice and you say that that's not good enough.                Do you know where this first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute on page 98a of the petition.             And it seems to me all part of one.    It is one notice?             It doesn't seem to specify a second and a third.              It's describing the contents.                "As part of that notice, the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the information and evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which portion by the Secretary."              The statute seems to be talking about one notice, not "first level," "second level."                 I thought that was taken out, the fourth one.       No?                 And tell me what that is. It's not in the statute?
07-1216 +++$+++                   You -- in answer to the Chief Justice, you are not suggesting that we should go ahead and decide the second question when there has been no briefing on it?
07-1223 +++$+++                  Well, what about the point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop everything that was later put before the district court; that there was a very short time to get the petition in, and there were many issues other than ineffective assistance of counsel?
07-1239 +++$+++ 
07-1309 +++$+++                 Before you do that, Mr. Yang, could you give us a sense, if you know it, about the practical results of the different formulas that -- there are at least three formulas, I take it that the different circuits have approved.                  In the result of the RICO prosecution, does it really make a difference which one of these is charged or do they could out the same way, anyway?
07-1315 +++$+++                  Isn't there something on the other side?     You seem to present this as a case, but counsel did a careful job, and then he lost faith.               He lost hope, and so he acted irrationally. But wasn't there on the other side consideration of the sentence that he was going to get, and might not a -- a lawyer perfectly rationally think: If I give up this defense, it is just going to waste everybody's time.     The judge is going to give me the benefit of -- of having done that in the sentence, in giving a lower sentence, in giving -- making the sentences on the multiple offenses concurrent rather than consecutive.                  Had Wager ever represented a defendant who pled NGI?               Is that the special -- he made a request for a particular prison.                  Is that the one?
07-1356 +++$+++                But we do know that unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no warning here at all.        I mean, he thinks he is talking to a cellmate.     Nobody tells him, "remember you've got a right to be represented by counsel," and he's essentially giving a statement without the Miranda warnings.               But the other side says well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to say something that's really involuntary when he is confronting police officers, that the reason that we exclude in the case of a police officer is this intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the police station or in the cell and there are these police officers.     Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that there is when the police do the questioning.              You urged a -- a fall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there should be a determination by the judge that the defendant intentionally testified falsely.                And I was wondering how that would operate.                You are here in the -- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I want to call snitch so-and-so.              And then what do we do, just interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial to test the credibility of the -- the informant?
07-1372 +++$+++                Then how to you explain the language, over and over again, I won't repeat it, but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by, compelled by, the Apology Resolution?                   Without the Apology Resolution it would be an entirely different case.   And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii Supreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology Resolution, before that this would have been impossible, and you are treating it now as sort of window dressing, icing on the cake, really didn't matter. But we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme Court if we didn't take them at their word and say -- using words such as "dictated," "compelled."                   You -- you are treating this as sort of just part of the atmosphere.               That's what you relied on but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on, and I would repeat the point I made in the prior argument:    what's worrisome about this is they are fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we are compelled to do this because of Federal law.                   What that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political process. If they left Federal law out of it, and they said truly this decision rests on State law, we think that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then they have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal law as a crutch.               If -- if you took Federal law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it reached and then we might have questions about its consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands Resolution; but as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse them of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion here, then the rest is to be sorted out.               We wouldn't have to say that they have a claim under State law, just not address it.                And the political process question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch.                 It seems a very weak reed.               And do you think --               Do you think that that resolution is distinguishable in any way from the apology that the United States made to the people of Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II? The United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an executive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful error and there was never reason for rounding these people up and putting them in interment camps. Did -- is there any difference?             And that, as I understand it, had no substantive effect until Congress passed legislation providing for compensation.               The Native Hawaiians --               The Native Hawaiians -- they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?               And what -- that comes out of Hawaii legislation?               The -- the $5.5 million figure, is that the subject of litigation?              Can I --              Can I go back to your -- your suggestion that this is a moot case because the government -- because the -- the governor agrees with your position.    But wasn't a lot of money already sunk into developing this area of Maui for desperately needed housing?
07-1410 +++$+++                But, Mr. Phillips, I'm looking at the last paragraph, and it says:                  We have no warrant from any relevant statute or regulation, et cetera.   So it wasn't limited to IMLA.                 Do you think that was just carelessness on the Court's part?                With respect to that --                -- the opinion in the last time around not only contained the statement that I read before, that is, any relevant statute, but in the very beginning it says, "We hold the tribe's claim for compensation from the federal government failed," and there is a well known distinction between a claim at issue and attributing to the Court that kind of carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA.          I think the Court was conscious of that distinction when it used the word that the claim failed, not just the issue.              So did you, Mr. Phillips. Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease was governed only by IMLA.           That -- those words were from your brief last time around.              But I thought -- you are really saying that you were wrong in make that concession.                  In -- IMLA --                  But it is the statute that seems most closely on point, because it's the only one that talks about mineral leases exclusively.
07-1428 +++$+++               What -- what has New Haven done in fact?      This certification was requested in March of 2004; we're now 2009.               What has New Haven done in order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire department?                  When you say "take away barriers," one thing is not a hundred percent clear. Your position is we have to do this in order to avoid Title VII disparate impact liability.                       Are you not reciting as a justification either the diversity in police -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a legacy of the past where fire departments were among the most notorious excluders on the basis of race?                  You are not -- you are not saying rectification of past discrimination?   You are not saying diversity?               What do you mean by --
07-1437 +++$+++               But that was a dissenting opinion, and that was how many years ago?                 How many years?               But you have a majority rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute terms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject matter jurisdiction.      So you can't say, well, Thermtron had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own unusual facts because the court gave a rationale.             I mean, courts give reasons for what they do.             And the court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d) has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals with only two kinds of remands, one for defective removal and the other for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.               What in addition to the civil rights provision?               Then that's a specific statute that would prevail over the general provision.              But Things Remembered, I think, was raised very carefully, such to say that the question that's before the Court now has not been decided before, the precise question here --              -- discretionary remand?              -- that it was neutral, colorless.   It just said we haven't been confronted with this issue.    And I think Powerex said the same thing, although it said it in more definite terms, it is far from clear.                 Maybe the district judge didn't say that.    Maybe you can point me to the place where it did.    But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong, because there is -- that's what supplemental jurisdiction is.    It's says you have jurisdiction, it's a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to exercise it or not.                 It wasn't a discretionary decision about RICO.       RICO -- there was no Federal claims stated.   That's out of it.                 What the district court has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, "I don't have jurisdiction," because Congress has given supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court to remand on stated conditions. But you -- you seem to conflate the absence of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction that the court undoubtedly has.               Then -- when what you are doing is that you are using the label "subject manager jurisdiction" in a way that seems to me, that -- there are many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction.                    Subject matter jurisdiction means court, you have no power, period.   There's no diversity, there's no Federal question, there's no other basis for the Federal Court to exercise jurisdiction; and to say, "Well, we can extend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include a case where the district court chooses not to hear several claims, even though it has jurisdiction over them."    I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the notion subject matter jurisdiction.                 Yes, but not subject matter jurisdiction.       Jurisdiction -- personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.                   When I did in -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all kinds of things like time limits on when you can sue, have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when they are not.   They are simply statutes of limitation.                 Why is it only technical? It says court, you can exercise power.                  Subject matter jurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there is undoubted power in the district court to hear those claims.                You put it in terms in your brief, if I understood your position correctly, yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were the words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.               The discretionary decision is that it chooses not to hear the case.                 It's not that -- there is no discretion there.               There's nothing discretionary about saying we have no jurisdiction.   "We have no jurisdiction" means we have no power.   So the -- the two are just at odds with each other.   No power, yes power, but we choose not to exercise it.                 Well, that would argue for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting the district judge's determination that it's not what -- it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it shouldn't because they are purely state-law questions. That's -- but that's something quite different from -- from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest itself of jurisdiction. If Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has it, and the Court can't divest itself of that.              It can, if Congress permits it, decline to exercise jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting itself of jurisdiction.
07-1529 +++$+++                 Did he have an opportunity to do it at the so-called 72-hour hearing? Was there any -- did the judicial officer ever ask him anything about whether he wanted counsel, whether he accepted counsel?    Was there any colloquy between them at all?                And is that standard operating procedure at these 72-hour hearings:              That the -- the defendant, who is there uncounseled is -- is just standing there, and the judicial officer says:              I'm appointing counsel for you, and he goes on to the next thing he's telling him? Yes.  Yes, Your Honor, that is how it              Did anybody ever tell him he needed to request?       I mean, he had just been told by a judicial officer:      I'm appointing counsel for you. He's not counseled at that point.                 How does he know that, in order to protect his right to counsel, he has to make some kind of an affirmative assertion?                 He's just been told he's got one.               I would have no problem at all with the argument you are making if someone had told him that he needed to do that.                      But he didn't have a judge to tell him that; he didn't have a lawyer to tell him that; and the police certainly didn't tell him that.                That's very puzzling. This is an experienced police officer.                    The 72-hour hearing is required in every case where defendant is in State custody.   So how could an experienced police officer not know?    Somebody, by the way, who knew this man had been kept until -- even more than 72 hours.                        And he testifies -- it's true that Detective Hall testified: I didn't know that he appointed -- had been appointed a lawyer.   The very same day that he got to the 72-hour hearing a day late, how could he not have known?                Louisiana.               Did the Louisiana Supreme Court say there has to be a request?                      I thought they said there had to be some action, affirmative act of acceptance.               It's just that everything after -- as far as I understand, the only piece of evidence we're talking about is his condolence letter to the widow which amounted to a confession of guilt.               There is no other. Because all of the Mirandized free 72-hour hearing, all that is not in contest; all of that came in.               Ms. Landry, you're trying to explain your position, let's assume, to an intelligent layperson, and the first example is, in many States at the equivalent of the 72-hour hearing, the defendant is told:      The court is prepared to appoint a lawyer for you.   Would you like us to appoint a lawyer? And the defendant will say yes.                So he will have made the request for a lawyer.            And then there are States like Louisiana where this is a rapid-fire proceeding, and the defendant isn't asked any questions, he isn't asked to agree or disagree, and he doesn't have any lawyer there to assist him. So you are essentially asking the Court to make a distinction between defendants in the same position, both uncounseled, both not knowledgeable in the law, but the one who has the good fortune to be in a State where the judge tells the defendant, "You have a right to have a lawyer.          Would you like me to appoint one?"   And then this procedure.               Shouldn't defendant's rights turn on that distinction in the State law?
07-1601 +++$+++                  May I -- may I just ask one question about the -- the situation of -- of these two potentially responsible parties?                     They are the only ones left, right?    Because B&B is bankrupt, and there's nobody else that has been identified.                 So it's only those two. And one question about the arranger liability -- well, first on the apportionment.             Assuming we don't accept your entire position, would a remand so that proof could be put in by both sides focusing on the issue of apportionment be appropriate?              You questioned the district, even -- even if apportionment were possible, you questioned how he arrived at it.               And is it true, as Ms. Sullivan said, that there is no other arranger case like this one where the, quote, "arranger" is the seller of a product?
07-208 +++$+++                 I thought your argument is it's not a choice, that there is only one standard, either you're competent or you're not competent?                  That is, I thought your position is competency is a unitary notion and your opponent's position is, no, there are shades of competency.              But this is a trial judge who has a very practical, immediate concern.                      And he's not looking at Dusky, not looking at Peretz.                      He says: I have found that Mr. Edwards is able to stand trial with the assistance of an attorney.                      I never made any finding that he was -- that he was competent if he didn't have that aid.       I never found that he was competent to defend himself.             He's competent, but only if he has a lawyer who is running the show. That was the finding that the trial judge made:    That's my finding.         Are you tell me to make that finding I have to say that he's not competent to stand trial?              Well -- suppose the judge, the trial judge, says:                  Mr. Stancil, please turn to page 15 of the blue brief.                   I have had considerable communication with this defendant.                   Read what it says there.       Do I have to wait for this to be repeated in the courtroom?            "Listen to this case, the foundations of my cause.           The Criminal Rule 4.           Court's territory, acknowledged May 29, 2001, abandoned for the young American citizen to bring a permissive intervention acting as the forces to predict my future disgrace by the court to motion young Americans to gather against crime." Now, that's not an isolated incident.                 This record is full of that kind of statement coming from this defendant.               Well, take the rest of the paragraph.               You have to stop.   I mean, you have given a reason that this might make sense.               But the judge says that means I have to sit here and every time he makes a statement like that explain to the jury what he meant? Then I'm becoming involved myself in a -- in a consulting role, not as an impartial judge of this case anymore, but as a kind of a facilitator of the defendant.              Mr. Stancil, you do agree that the basic precedent on which you rely, Faretta, you would be -- you are asking for an extension of it because that case starts out with a defendant who is described as literate, competent, understanding.              And was there anything in the record showing that he had, that Faretta had, mental delusions, mental disease?              But the judicial posture there was a little different.               It was a question of what the State had to do, not what the State could do.
07-21 +++$+++               That is not the case that you are confronting.              I mean, the reason they are bringing a facial challenge is because the horse is going to be out of the barn.            They will have the election, and just what they are afraid of could happen, that the result will be skewed in favor of the opposite party, because there are people who have not been able to vote.   So, if you're going to talk about what is the impact of this, they are in this bind after the election -- well -- they've always -- already lost that one. Now, there is something in the briefs that happened after this case was instituted, but we know from Marion County that there were 34 people who were not able to have a vote counted.               And of those 34, only two ended up qualifying after the fact.                   So, we know that in that one particular county, most of the people who were unable to satisfy the requirement initially ended up not satisfying it. Is that -- I mean that's not hypothetical. That's real.     But it does give you some confirmation that it isn't mere speculation that there are going to be many people who will not -- whose vote will not count.                  It's the same board that said in all our experience, in all of our memory, there has never been an impersonator.               How does Indiana stack up against other States in the inflation of the voter rolls?               And you are under a consent decree to do something about that?               One aspect of your system -- I know your time is about to expire -- but it seems to me that every indigent person in -- who doesn't have a photo ID is put to a burden that the mass of voters are not put to -- that is either the two-step process and not going to my local precinct, but having to go to the county courthouse.      That burden is on every indigent person who doesn't have a photo ID, so we are not speculating about numbers.         That would be true for every indigent person who doesn't have photo ID, right?               Well, they can go home and get the identification and go back to their precinct; that's what the indigent can't do.               Before you do that, General Clement, I'd like to you to concentrate on the one group of people where I think you can make a facial challenge and may not all speculating, and that's the indigent people who can't get -- don't have the photo ID.   They don't drive, and they can't get up the money to get the birth certificate or whatever else.                 They do have a burden that, it seems to me, the State could easily eliminate if they want those people to vote, and that is to say okay, do the affidavit, the whole thing in your local precinct; we'll make it easy for you and not send you away, send you off to the county courthouse to get it validated.      Why -- why, if you really wanted people to vote, wouldn't you do it that way?               But I'm --               Just on -- just on that one class of people.               And that's not going to change after the election.           I mean here is a group of people who are being put to a burden of going someplace else.   And my only question is, why couldn't the system make it easy for them if we really want to help America to vote, all Americans, and say we'll do it in the local precinct, somebody will be there to help you fill out the affidavit, instead of doing it in a way that's really going to discourage people from voting?               Well, I'm not concentrating --               I was trying to deal with this one category of person, and the State -- it was addressed, and the State said, well, we can't do it that way because that will lead to congestion at the polling place.   But it seems to me that that is powerfully hard to reconcile with the claim that there are so few of these people it's not really a problem.                 If there are so few of them, then I don't understand why they should be put to the burden of going someplace other than the polling place.

What are the limiting principles that you say attach to this statute?               Whose certificate is it? Is it the contractor's certificate that everything that the subs have done or the certificate of conformance that Allison provided, that SOFCO provided?                But that was only the contract.   You didn't show that in fact that had happened, that the certificates of conformance actually were shown to a naval officer?              There has been a statement, in opposition to your position, that the way you read (a)(2) would render (a)(1) useless, That everything would fall within (a)(2). Is there a distinction between what comes under (a)(1) and (a)(2), in your view?              Thank you.
07-219 +++$+++                 There's some confusion, Mr. Fisher, about this Kolstad.              I take your -- it has entered this case at two levels.               One is this business about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a tanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently enforced policy.   So you don't have any problem with Kolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a managerial --                  There was a statute that was raised in the district court.                  And the district court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was one of the things the court of appeals said under the head of waiver.     They're substituting one federal statute for another.               Mr. Fisher --              -- your time is running out.   And this there's one question I'd like you to address, and that is are there other cases against Exxon seeking compensation and punitive damages based on this oil spill that are still awaiting trial or decision?                  Or is this it?              So you don't have the problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and than B, C and D all wanting to --
07-290 +++$+++               It doesn't means all.   It doesn't mean -- "keep," on your reading, at least if it's consistent with Miller, keep and bear some arms, but not all arms.              If we're going back to the English Bill of Rights, it was always understood to be subject to the control and limitation and restriction of Parliament.    And I don't think there's any doubt about that.   And that's what we're talking about here, are legislative restrictions.  minute? If it did, I think then                 There is a lot of talk about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny. Does it make a practical difference whether we take your standard or the strict scrutiny that was in the D.C. Circuit's opinion?      And specifically there is a whole panoply of Federal laws restricting gun possession. Would any of them be jeopardized under your standard? And the same question with the District scrutiny, does it make any difference?              Well, it did.          It said it's just like the First Amendment.                     First Amendment has exceptions, but strict scrutiny applies.                    It says strict scrutiny applies here too.                Is it a limitation?           Is it any limitation on the legislature?                     Is the first clause any limitation on the legislature?                If you were thinking of "the people," what those words meant when the Second Amendment was adopted, it was males between the ages of what -- 17 and 45?      People who were over 45 had no -- they didn't serve in the militia.              For example?  General Clement told us that's machine gun qualify? standard issue in the military.              At this time -- I would just like to follow up on what you said, because if you were right that it was at that time, yes; but that's not what Miller says.    It says that the gun in question there was not one that at this time -- this time, the time of the Miller decision -- has a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia.         So it's talking about this time.              If it's a fundamental right, what about licensing?           One piece -- we've talked about trigger locks, we've talked about the ban on handguns, but there is also a requirement that there be a license for possession of a handgun.                    Assuming you're right on the first question, that you couldn't flatly ban handguns, what about a requirement that you obtain a license to carry -- to have a handgun?              What about this very law? If you take out the ban -- there is a law on the books. It's one of the ones that you challenged.                It's section 22-4504(a).    Wouldn't that be okay -- would that be okay?   It says that you have to have a license to carry.              It just says -- it says you have to get a license if you want to possess a gun. What kind of standard?        It just says you have to have a license.
07-308 +++$+++                If 7422(a) had said any -- any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed in alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would cut -- cut out the six-year statute of limitations, right?   If it said the refund procedure applies to any Internal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged violation of the Export Clause?              Nothing different from what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within the term "any Internal Revenue tax"?              I thought you didn't have to pay --               Well, what about the deficiency procedure?        And I don't know if that applies with excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax and they get a notice of deficiency.                      Where would they go?               Why not?               But you're saying it's both.     You're not saying it's "either/or" because for three years you did use the refund procedure.                       So you used the refund procedure for the years that were within the three-year period, and then for the years that were outside the three-year period, you have this other theory.     So you're not saying this is not for refund. That route is closed.        The only route is this constitutional -- this claim directly under the Export Clause.    But your own conduct seems to have been it's our option.    We can treat it as a refund claim or we can treat it as a constitutional claim.               In other words, what were you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim; this is a constitutional claim.                But you are now saying, I think, that it's both; it's whatever the taxpayer or the plaintiff wants it to be.               You're saying you get interest too in either way.              You're saying -- I thought you said for the three years that are within the three-year refund limit, you get interest and then you're also saying, going back six years, you also get interest.     You're not saying that if you -- if you're outside the refund procedure you don't get interest.               2411 -- 2411 is what you use in the court when you have a straight tax refund claim.   It's not as though 2411 is there for some other claim.   It's what you get when you go to court and you're suing for a refund.          That's 2411.            That's applicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.                    That's what -- it's in Title 28, but that's what it's for.                    It's for an overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.              But -- the use of any Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this isn't an Internal Revenue tax.               So it's clearly not an Internal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional claim directly under the Constitution, so how does it become for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax?               But you don't agree in your basic claim that if the government is treating it as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't, you'd say that works only for the interest, not --
07-312 +++$+++               I thought, Mr. Brunstad, that the question was asked:           So the State is not going to get its tax at the time of the asset transfer, because the cash is needed to eventually have a plan that works.   So the State doesn't get its tax. And then it turns out that there is no plan; that the case is dismissed.              What happens then?         Florida has to get back -- at that point gets the tax that it wanted up front?              They are all paid up front, but they are put into escrow.                     Is that what you are telling me?                Mr. Brunstad, there's an aspect of the way this looks that I don't understand, and you're an expert in this area.                  Perhaps you can explain it to me. You have one of these 363(b) sales of property, and then you have a global settlement with the creditors.   What function does the plan serve after you have all that?    The assets have been sold.                The creditors have made a settlement.                  There's going to be no reorganization; whatever there is, is going to be distributed. What is the function of having a plan after all that confirmed?       I know one purpose of it is that you avoid paying the stamp tax.                But is there any other purpose once you have already settled that the sale is made, the creditors agree on how it's going to be divided up?    What is the function that the plan serves?                Why shouldn't we look to see how it was in the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the Federal State tax exemption?                       That I think leaves no room for argument.        This case might be argued either way about does it apply to preconfirmed plan asset transfers?   But as I understand it, this section 4382(b) was limited to post-confirmation transfers, that is transfers made within five years after confirmation of the plan.               Well, what was -- what did section -- I'm not talking about -- you mentioned 267.    42 -- 4382(b), what did that say?               Section -- 26 U.S.C. 4382(b).               Yes.               That was in the 1954 Code.    I'm not talking about 1898.               I thought that said that the tax exemption was limited to transfers post-confirmation.               Maybe you can straighten me out, because where I get this from is the brief for the State, and it's at page 17, mentions the now-repealed 4382(b).
07-320 +++$+++               The problem is it's every $10,000.   As you pointed out, it doesn't require more disclosure.   All of this information would be disclosed under the system without this 24-hour, and that I think is the complaint, the burden of having every time you spend $10,000 to file something.               It --              But I thought that --              -- that Justice Breyer's question, General Clement, was he asked you to assume that that was unconstitutional, and you were answering if it was unconstitutional.           But there is one person whose speech is being discouraged in the picture, and that's the contributor to the self-financed candidate. You have to recognize that that one can't speak as much vis-a-vis the contributors to the other candidate.
07-330 +++$+++               Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I think there's a larger anterior question to all of this? And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can bring charges.    The judge may think, my goodness, looking at this set of facts, you could have charged much more. The judge can't do that, he can't tell the prosecutor you have to charge "Y" in addition to "X". The government chooses not to appeal.                     Now, what right does the court say, I know you didn't appeal, Government, but should have so we're going to take care of it for you? It seems to me that our system rests on a principle of party presentation as many systems do not. In many systems, the court does shape the controversy and can intrude issues on its own.                  But in our adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind of thing.   So, my problem with your whole position, without getting down to particular statutory provisions, is what business does the court have to put an issue in the case that counsel chose not to raise?              Well, he doesn't have to pursue it if the Government appeals.                 I didn't understand that a party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of appeal. I mean, suppose the only way that the court of appeals can get into this is because the defendant has pursued an appeal. Suppose this comes up and the defendant says, oh, my goodness, I stand to get 15 more years in prison; I'm withdrawing my notice of appeal.                  There's nothing before the court of appeals then.                  Nothing.               Yes.               Right.

07-371 +++$+++               Would you explain to me how that could possibly work? I can understand that you're making an argument that the second case, there was a recruitment, there was collusion or whatever.              But for all we know from this record, how could Taylor possibly be bound when Herrick's suit is over?           Because as far as we know, Taylor never heard of that first case.                   How can somebody be bound by a litigation in which they had no notice, no opportunity to be heard? So if we freeze the situation at the of case one, how could Taylor possibly be bound?              Because he's asking for Herrick who is bound by the first case.              Because what you're saying is the person who is really in the second case is the same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is simply acting as an agent to give Herrick another chance?              But we're talking about binding Taylor.              There was no finding of that.    There was no finding here of agency relationship. That would be a There was no finding of collusion. different case.              No.      It said it wasn't reaching that question.              There is in the -- in the Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the examples involve a representational relationship that existed at the time of the first litigation.                   There's nothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion would be proper here.              Yes, but here --              Do you agree with me about the facts that we're dealing with here?                   As far as the first case is concerned, no evidence that Taylor even knew that Herrick was -- Herrick was bringing that suit?              But -- and while the litigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it, right?              Okay.          And is there any evidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA request --              -- after Herrick lost his case?              But that wasn't my question.              My question, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, is:             Did Herrick ask Taylor to file that FOIA suit?      And I think your answer is no. There's no evidence of that.              Is there any evidence that Herrick financed the litigation?              Is there any evidence that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?              In any case, the decision that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.              So if another member of the club, let's say another member of the aviation association who's interested in antique planes, just files a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who is -- who knows that Herrick brought a suit and lost? He's just a member of the club.               He doesn't want to help Herrick restore the plane.              But my question was just a member of the association, whether --              But why does there have to be any interest?      Going back to a question I think Justice Scalia asked, we're dealing with a most unusual statute.    You don't have to have any reason for a FOIA request.               I'm not sure what the hypothetical is.    I mean it is certainly not the case that -- let's say you have a whole busload of people who get injured in the same accident.                 Plaintiff one sues and loses.   Two sues and loses.              Three is not precluded. Four is not precluded.               And if all that has been proved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said: We're not going to look into what they call strategic whatever. We're going to take it just as it is, with none of -- no showing that these two are in cahoots.               There was no showing that Herrick ever asked Taylor -- well, there is a showing that they're interested in rebuilding this plane or restoring the plane.        But we don't have -- and the D.C. Circuit said it was not relevant to its analysis.                 Yes, I would totally agree with you if we have a recruiting situation, if we have a financing situation.                 But the D.C. Circuit said:      Well, that's irrelevant.              That's out of the case because the court of appeals said:                  We do not need to determine whether they count as tactical maneuvering. We do not do so.              It could be remanded.        It could be remanded with instructions that the collusion question is still open.         Prove it.           It hasn't been proved.               Anyone --anyone in this audience, and anyone in the association would be a proper FOIA plaintiff; is that right?
07-411 +++$+++               Well, they said they don't need to because they said if they win on their claim, then their whole case --               There is no objection --              You're not asking us to resolve that circuit split in this case.              To elaborate tribal common law.               Mr. Frederick, before you finish, I would like for to you give your best answer to a lurking, underlying concern, and that is the the Chief Justice brought up the outsider subjected to courts where the outsider has no vote.              That happens when you sued in a State that's not your own, but there is the right to remove and also at the end of the line is this Court.   And I think in the case of the tribal courts, neither of those exist.        There's no -- you can't remove to a State or Federal court, and this Court has no review authority over a tribal court's judgment.              Not the same faith and credit that it would give to a sister State judgment?                 But then could you go into Federal court under what was in farmers and say we had no jurisdiction because we had a forum selection clause?
07-440 +++$+++                 What was filed by the police?    What was filed by the police --                -- to justify holding this person?    You can't just say the police brought someone in and they get locked up in jail.                The police had to present something --                -- to show probable cause and it was the burden of the State in the presence of the police officer to prove probable cause.                     So that had to be based on something.          What was it based on?              And then -- and then the defendant was told or was given Miranda warnings.                      What was said to him precisely about right to counsel in the warnings that the magistrate gave him?              Yes.          But if he is told -- the defendant is listening to this.                     And, magistrate, you just told me I have a right to counsel. Okay, I would like counsel.            And then the magistrate says, no you're not entitled to counsel?                 I thought you -- I thought you recognized that if he had opted to have this examining trial to determine whether there really was probable cause, that he would be entitled to counsel at that examining trial.       And, yet, that's detached from the fair trial.   The whole purpose of it is that they will never get to trial.               Suppose that he is out on bail, but he has a suspicion that this alleged felony -- that that wasn't cricket because it was expunged.                 So he says to the judge:      Judge, I want to contest my being held to some kind of criminal process because there is no basis for the charge. So he is out on bail.                He has no lawyer, but he wants to contest the State's right to hold him at all, and he asks for a lawyer to help him do that.              Is it then episodic? That is, if the right is turned on when there is a critical event, and then the critical event is over, and no more right to counsel until the next critical event? It's not -- you have no right to counsel in between those critical events?                 So you only need this one critical stage, and then you get appointed counsel at that stage, and that counsel will continue thereafter. You don't have to --
07-455 +++$+++               And maybe they said - maybe because they're trying to draft legislation without using pronouns. (Laughter.)
07-463 +++$+++                 If you had had a ruling on where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then that would have been precedent for all these other cases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a determination?                But you are seeking a different line.   And, by the way, I don't know what the line is that you are seeking.             But the government says if you don't need an EA, then you don't have to give notice, comment, et cetera.            What would be your standard for when you need notice and comment?                 Do you want to say a word about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire nation, on a controversial question that normally the court would just rule for its own area?
07-474 +++$+++                 The Ninth Circuit decision would rule out the case where an employee says: I was the most qualified person for this position by far, but the supervisors took a bribe from a rich uncle to promote somebody else.                That would be out?               The scapegoat case, too, would be out?              That's not -- you know that that's not the position they took in their brief. They said it's not a hypothetical, any conceivable. They said that by qualifying -- even in the at-will category, the government has to articulate a reason rooted in the facts of this case, not a hypothetical.                 A hypothetical reason is not good enough.              In Oregon, is -- would there be a civil service remedy available to someone in this situation?              The Administrative Procedure Act doesn't apply to State -- to State procedures.   It's a Federal act --              -- governing Federal agencies.              Except this wasn't -- this wasn't employment at will, right?              When you do that with the two cases that I raised with Miss Metcalf?               That is, the bribe case and the scapegoat case, they are out, too. If public employment is taken out from this class-of-one, those two cases would go as well.
07-499 +++$+++                Mr. Katsas --               What -- what about the position that the displaced person's act was special to the Holocaust?   I mean, we are dealing with people who said we were just following orders, and we did not want to grant those people asylum. Now in this post-World War II effort, we are engaged in an enterprise where other countries in the world -- and should we look to see how they are interpreting this notion of duress, coercion?          Are they considering it irrelevant; would just look to see if the person in fact was provided some material assistance to persecution?
07-512 +++$+++                 I don't understand what you just said.   Judge Gould dissented.                 He said the Ninth Circuit majority was wrong.                And you're urging us to accept Judge Gould's position.                How can we do that without saying that the majority was wrong?                  The Ninth Circuit had a precedent that it thought it was following.                       Was it Anaheim?               So isn't it important that if you think that they were wrong and we agree with you, that we get -- not just vacate but say you were wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you were wrong in Anaheim.         And then the Ninth Circuit will not follow those decisions anymore.
07-513 +++$+++               Mr. Dreeben, what you've said about the danger to the arresting office -- officer and so they don't undertake an arrest lightly, doesn't fit with the facts of this case.                This was a police officer who really wanted to go after the defendant.                     He expected -- he suspected defendant was a bad guy.                   So that's how this all started.             So he called his own department, do we have any warrant, and then the next county's department.       But this was an officer who wanted to go after the defendant.                 But that's not what we have here, and we have a 13 percent error rate.                     If this case goes your way, the police have limited resources; why should they spend them on upgrading their computer system when if there is an error it wasn't matter?               How many 1983 recoveries have there been when someone says the police, they convicted me on the basis of this evidence that wasn't suppressed, but they committed a Fourth Amendment violation so I should prevail in the 1983 action?             How many defendants in that situation have ever won a 1983 action?
07-526 +++$+++                As you read the statute, Ms. Maynard, the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" could be deleted and the statute would mean the same thing that you're urging. So what do the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" add?
07-542 +++$+++                 You are not asking to overrule Belton; you are asking to take it in the context in which it was presented, where there was genuine concern for officer safety.                     Is that --
07-543 +++$+++                 That was -- that was coming back to work and having all of your seniority stripped.   Is that --                Mr. Russell, what do you say to Mr. Phillips' argument that you brought -- you brought essentially this case way back when, that the union said that this retirement plan is in violation of Title VII?              Are you -- are you making a claim that they had the choice or that the claim wasn't ripe until they felt the impacts of it?
07-5439 +++$+++                Mr. Englert, I thought that there wasn't a serious question about who inserts the IV, that those are trained people, but the point that was highlighted was that the people who control the flow into the IV connection, that those people have no training, the ones that are called executioners, the ones who operate the, what is it, the syringe.               But they also are not trained people.    I think what seems puzzling to me is the State has made an effort to make sure that the people on the team that inserts the IV, that those are well-trained professional people, but then apparently they leave the room, so that once the IV is inserted there is no professional person that has any further part.                 It's still unclear why they should make such an effort to get trained personnel in the first instance and then even if they are in the next room, why isn't, why did they deliberately pick nonprofessional people to both administer the drugs and to check the inmate for consciousness.                 What are the reasons.                 But have you that expert team and it seems that they would be preferable to executioner who have no professional qualifications.   And the executioners are also not visible to the public?               There was a finding that the second drug serves no therapeutic purpose.               That's --               Mr. Garre would you explain to me I can't the Federal Government has picked five grams instead of flee.
07-544 +++$+++ 
07-552 +++$+++                 I thought it said -- I thought it said, Mr. Englert, that, that the United States has -- is treated as having assigned part of its claim for damages to the qui tam relator, and that gave the qui tam plaintiff a stake in the action, a stake in the proceeds.   I thought that Vermont Agency -- and Justice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong -- was envisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle was talking about when he said there are assignments and then there are assignments.               Well, what did they do? I mean, you mention necessary parties but these other -- on your own theory the PSPs are not necessary parties, and this -- this is a defendant seeking to join additional plaintiffs, and that's rather odd.               And you also talk about interpleader.               I don't know who is the stakeholder in this picture.              The significance --               -- to the legal title, would it make a difference if the assignee did not have legal title, was just --               So -- but is that just a formality?    For example, the question I asked Mr. Phillips.    Could a creditor of the aggregator get at this money when the check is paid by AT&T and Sprint and therefore reduce the amount available to distribute to the PSPCs?               How about for tax purposes?    Must the aggregator report the proceeds as income?
07-562 +++$+++               Mr. Frederick, are you saying that the consent decree -- because we have overtaken Judge Kessler's decision by consent decree, right and it has terms?        Does a -- does a consent decree terms allow state attorney generals to say don't advertise low?                Could a state attorney general say under my authority to check against false and deceptive advertising, no cigarette company can advertise in this State low or light?              Suppose he wins the lawsuit -- he wins the lawsuit that it's false and deceptive to say "low."         Could he then have a regulation that says cigarette companies don't advertise "low" or "light"?               Well, can you make that concrete?    What would change about the label "low" or "light"?              This is in the Reilly case.
07-581 +++$+++                What about --               --     if it's not a statutory right; it's just a wrongful discharge?                    One practical problem is so often these are overlapping claims.   You can say, "I was discriminated against before because of my age.          I was arbitrarily discriminated against.       It was a wrongful discharge.                  It was a discharge without just cause."                    Usually, there's multiple claims that can be made, and some of them would be bargainable, I mean, would come under the union -- I mean if it was just a question of the worker says, "I was discharged without just cause," no Title 7 or anything else, that would come under the arbitration clause, wouldn't it?               What about the argument that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting the employee to a worse situation because the employer will simply say:    Fine, I don't have to bargain anything with the union.    If you want to work in this workplace, you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no access to the court, and you have to -- just like in Gilmer, just like in Circuit City.
07-582 +++$+++                Mr. Phillips, this -- this is similar to the question that I asked General Garre.     The Commission asked for a remand so it could provide a reasoned explanation.                But you had or your clients had -- in their complaint they made an APA claim as well as a First Amendment claim, didn't they?               Yes.               Correct.               Yes.              You could have just done the First Amendment, but you -- you did put the APA into it.
07-588 +++$+++ 
07-591 +++$+++                  Then you're predicting that grind to a halt, but there are going to be a large number that wash out because they are plea bargained. So they won't get into the picture at all.               There will probably be a goodly number in which defense counsel will stipulate that the drug quantity -- the drug type was such and such and quantity such and such.               So you don't know in how many cases the defendant would take advantage of this confrontation right?              Well, maybe if you were just -- if you were just putting in the machine, the raw information from the machine.            But here what speaks is the certification by the analyst, so you don't have simply a machine-generated result; you have a human person who seems to be testifying:                I certify that this is an accurate report.
07-6053 +++$+++               Does that mean, what you just said, that this is not a problem in States that have adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence?                 Because, as I understand it, there is an exception, the standard exception, for when the defendant procures the witness's absence for the very purpose of preventing the witness from testifying at a particular trial.                 That's the exception that's in the Federal Rules of Evidence.                  You don't have an exception, a hearsay exception, for just being responsible for the witness's unavailability. So practically, this couldn't come in under a hearsay objection in places that have the Federal Rules of Evidence; is that right?               Isn't there a problem that was brought out in the briefs with -- this man is standing trial before a jury that's going to determine guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if this testimony is going to come in, the judge has to make some kind of a preliminary finding that he killed her in advance of the jury making that determination.
07-608 +++$+++               I thought it was that the use of force -- to make it clear is a misdemeanor -- had to involve a use of force, and that wasn't clear before, right?              What sense would it make for Congress to say take two abusers?                   The conduct is identical.   And in state A there is one consequence to bar on the possession of guns, and state B there isn't for the identical conduct, why would Congress want these two different results?                But suppose this statute, the one that was enacted, had the word "if" before "committed."   Would that then convey the meaning that the Government is urging?          Has as an element use of force, comma, "if" committed.                "If committed" would break from "use of force."          The element is the use of force, but then the crime would have to have been committed by a current or former spouse; so wouldn't an "if" separate what is the element, that is, use of force?              But if -- counsel advising Mr. Hayes surely would have looked at what was the uniform position in all the circuits.                 All the circuits that had this question before the floor read it the way the Government is urging.                 So counsel I think would have been highly irresponsible to advise Mr. Hayes that he would be home free, simply because his own State didn't have a separate domestic violence statute.
07-610 +++$+++                But what did the Court mean in Lehnert when it said there must be some indication the payment is for service that may ultimately inure to the benefit of members of the local union by virtue of their membership in the parent organization?              But couldn't it be, couldn't the national say, local, you have asked for assistance with such-and-such litigation.                We think your case is what this Court sometimes calls a bad vehicle. We don't want to finance your litigation, the issue is important and we are going to wait for a case that presents it in a better light, is more likely to win.
07-615 +++$+++               But that's not saying that.   Isn't that -- that issue is moot?              But if we -- if we took the position that you are expressing about what is at issue, we would never reach the second question.               Do I understand correctly that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?               Yes.               So why wouldn't the United States get credit for that, too, on the theory that I suggested before?               It has nothing to do with matters before the --                 Why not?      I mean, the question I raised before, why wouldn't the United States be urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the money or whether the people who are creditors of Iran get the money.   In either case, the United States should be able to have --               Mr. Phillips, one piece of -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States could recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims, including Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million.                      How would the United States go about recouping from Iran the money it has paid to the victims of Iran's terrorism?               Yes.          How would that work?     How would -- how would the United States --               You said this is a one of a kind case.    Are there no other victims who have successfully sued Iran?
07-636 +++$+++                I think there is a question of the way it was phrased.                     And perhaps the court just didn't get it, what that question on which we didn't grant cert was driving at.                 Before you do, leaving the plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that the plan administrator is not required to give effect to a waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary designation.    Is it just not required?                 Does the administrator have discretion to give effect to the waiver, or it -- must it disregard the waiver and strictly follow the beneficiary designation?                You made the contention now -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if you get something in return for a disclaimer, then the disclaimer is not effected.            That it's effected only if you receive nothing in return.              And what -- what is the source of that contention that you can't disclaim if you get something in return?
07-665 +++$+++               Can we go back to -- your basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area, demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks have been places where people can speak their minds. But I don't know of any tradition that says people can come to the park with monuments and put them up if they will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place and manner. So you're making an assumption that from time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be presented by anyone who wants to.               Are you taking this line because you say if the city council votes for it, then the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to vote them out?    Is that -- what underlies this notion that it isn't good enough for them to approve the placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of formal declaration?
07-689 +++$+++                But you stipulated.        You didn't want to argue the third factor.                 You wanted -- you just started out by saying you were tired of this litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule.                  And now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation really didn't stipulate away the third factor.                 I thought you were giving in on that issue so that you could get the first issue decided.              What was wrong with the clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC case?               Justice Souter, in his opinion in the LULAC case --   --               he suggested what he called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you met that standard, you're okay.                 What -- what Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his question.     He said:     Suppose you make it, the threshold, instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the African-American population as in the crossover group. That would be the threshold.               I thought you were conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they could be 48 percent, I think you said.
07-6984 +++$+++                Even though, as in this case, it turned out he found out within a year.               But suppose he didn't find out for more than a year; that is, he didn't find out that -- that the appeal had been filed, and he didn't find out about the dismissal?                  So because either his counsel or the State blundered, he is out in the cold, and he can never present his direct- appeal claim.               Mr. Goldstein just explained to us why those two provisions, the (b) and (d) would not work.     That this --                 And Texas could -- and Texas could have gone into the State court and said: Don't give him the direct review; he waited four and a half years after he -- but the State didn't ask for that.              Justice could have -- not only, that don't some States have a limitation period when -- when he finds out that his appeal has been dismissed, without notice to him, aren't there some States, criminal justice systems, that say from the date that you had knowledge, you have X days to file?
07-751 +++$+++                You are talking about the main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I think the Court has said a number of times to make this search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if you want to interject the judicial between police and the person in jeopardy.       So the main rule is warrant unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your point is that there is a main rule.               This Court has gotten from the Constitution?               Get a warrant if you can.               Even if there is such a thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this record that -- that they do not want confidential informers to go making arrests, so that the police distinguish the confidential informer.                But going back to why should we decide this question, particularly in Fourth Amendment cases when these issues will come up on suppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide them in the -- in the civil context.
07-77 +++$+++                Then it was the district judge that made Alabama go to the preclearance after the second --               But still, if you take this case at its essence, a circuit court got Alabama law wrong and that's what you say counts as to make the law operative. The law becomes operative because an Alabama intermediate court or trial court made a wrong decision about Alabama law; and then when the supreme court corrects it, that doesn't count.               That's essentially your position, that they're locked, Alabama is locked into a mistake that was made about Alabama law by that circuit court.               It's a review of a lower court by a higher court.         That's what higher courts do. They review for correctness, and the Alabama Supreme Court said the circuit court got it wrong.                     It misconstrued the law, and we are correcting that.                     And that's -- that's correct.              The Federal court told the Alabama --              It told Alabama.     I thought -- I thought that one of the reasons was adjudication wasn't complete when the district court made its first ruling, so the district court said, now, go off and get those two Alabama Supreme Court decisions precleared.              What did they say?              But the State's position was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the State's highest court --              -- saying that the State lower court got it wrong.              That all depends on there having been a change.        What there was was gubernatorial appointment.    Then the legislature passes a law. Suppose that the circuit court had said, sorry, legislature, you got it wrong, general prevails, you can't do it this way, the law is invalid.                  Suppose the circuit court had said that.              Then there would not have been an election, right.              So there becomes -- there becomes a change only because the circuit court has made the mistake about what the State law is.                  That's very odd.
07-772 +++$+++ 
07-773 +++$+++                But that's the question that I have, Mr. Phillips.            What is the underlying dispute between the parties? It seems to me that your look-through argument is look-through only halfway.                    That is, if you look -- if you consider the controversy, the suit that was brought in the State court, the controversy is here we have a customer who hasn't paid the amount charged. So we have a suit on a debt.              Why isn't that the controversy?     You have to make the counterclaim the controversy, which comes up only defensively.                   It wasn't brought as a lawsuit.                But -- but she chose to assert it only defensively; and it's not a complaint -- the counterclaim if it had been brought as an independent action, everybody agrees qualifies for Federal jurisdiction.       But the litigant who has this claim is asserting it only as a defense to a claim that you admit does not qualify for Federal jurisdiction.                But in the practical effect, what happens?       Now you have asserted that you can enforce because of the counterclaim that asserts -- that arises under Federal law.               But you say it's is not the same as removal because the underlying claim, your suit on the debt owed, remains in Federal -- State court; but what happens to that claim once you have this arbitration?               I meant -- I didn't mean to say you couldn't get affirmative relief on a counterclaim.   Of course you could.                    But this --               Chose not to --               -- chose not to litigate the case, chose to -- well, I'm being sued, so I'm going to bring up this claim.        It wasn't as an original matter.                 The controversy between the parties is the credit card company says, customer, you're in default $10,000; and the customer said, if that's so, then I have certain offsets because they charged me too much interest.              How do you --                 -- how do you -- it's all part of the same controversy, isn't it?               There would be nothing inappropriate about a State court entertaining that excessive interest claim, but applying Federal law to it.   I mean the -- 1831(d) says that Federal law governs the interest --               Not state usury law.       So you could have this case going on in State court.               And the State court would be perfectly competent to apply the Federal law.                That claim doesn't --                But there could be nothing left for the State court to do after you have the arbitration.   I mean, not that you arbitrate about interest due on a nonexistent debt.                     I mean, you have to have the two things together.                I just can't envision a case where what you haven't effected is taking a case, a debt, simple debt, no diversity a State court case.                And you remove the State court from the picture and gotten it over into Federal court to order the arbitration and any follow-up to the arbitration.   It just seems to me you have effected -- accomplished what you could not have accomplished by the -- by removal, which you admit that you can't remove on the basis of a counterclaim.                 But you could have asked for that in the State court as well, and --                Why isn't it proper to look to see -- the party who wants arbitration has a dispute; the dispute is we are owed money by the debtor. Why shouldn't the court say, well, we'll see what your case is about; if your case would qualify for Federal jurisdiction, fine.       But we are not going to look to see what the defendants cases is or might be.                   We'll just look at your case and that's how we will define the controversy.                But then you'll have not only a hypothetical claim, because nothing has been brought, but an hypothetical answer by way of counterclaim to that claim.               So you would come into the court and say there is no suit going on anywhere, but if we were to bring this suit in State court, the defendant could have brought this Federal counterclaim? That's a lot of hypothesis.                  Excuse me --                  What do you do with the assertion that sections 9 through 11 are not in sync with your view, because they would not give you -- you could go in and -- to compel arbitration but once the arbitration was award -- an award was made, you would not have access to the Federal courts to enforce the award?
07-8521 +++$+++                But all this is dependent upon the defendant is showing that he is financially unable to obtained adequate representation.            And if he is in the State court, then that's the answer to it. It's the only when he isn't.           And I thought in the clemency cases, particularly, there was no funds in State court.
07-854 +++$+++                  This is creating -- this is creating a database.         And what was the year of this prosecution?                 And back in 1979 we did not have the information-gathering electronic capability that we now have.    So what are we talking about?                 What kind of database?    How would it operate?               Would you --                Mr. Rosenkranz, you have, it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the theory that the Ninth Circuit went on.                   I mean, the Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising deputy district attorneys.          And why do we train them? Because we want to ensure that they share information. Now you are cutting out the training and supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the supervising attorney is to have this information bank, which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult, which, may be a very sound policy.                 But is it an element of due process that the supervising attorney has to devise a system to share information?                   Where is there anything -- anything that the Court has held that suggests that there is a data collection function required by due process?               And there is nothing in the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had to do with this talk about training?               But the bottom line would be, if you are right, that every district attorney in the country, large or small office, would have to have a data bank that can be shared by all prosecutors, informants that are used.           That would be the constitutional requirement for every supervising prosecutor in the land.
07-869 +++$+++                Well, if the State wants to, it's because it can exercise a heavy hand and control its local units, but if it wants to give the local units discretion, then it has to leave it to the local units whether or not they want to enact such a ban.   That's your position?               My question really is, if you look at this at the most basic level, we have two important concessions.       You don't question the constitutionality of the ban as to State employees.                     And the other side doesn't question that it is unconstitutional as to private employees.                  So here we have State local employees.            Do we bracket them with with State employees or with private employees as essential --
07-901 +++$+++                Mr. Lannet, there -- there is one significant difference, I think, between -- the-- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State labels something a "sentencing factor" or an "element." Every one of those questions that goes into determining the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury under Apprendi. But when it comes to consecutive versus concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent.                   Or it leaves the total things to the discretion of the judge. And if we are looking at it from the point of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not going to make it totally discretionary because we want to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting certain restraints on the judge.                So it seems -- what seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment is supposed to protect the defendant's right.                And here the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more of a right.    And he can say, that's unconstitutional, but if you give me less of a right, it would be perfectly constitutional. It's that enigma that I think is very disturbing about this case.               Mr. Lannet, if we agree with your position and let's say you are engaged by the Oregon legislature and they say to you:                We don't want to make this just be the judge's discretion alone, what can we do to achieve Constitution of what we were trying to achieve, that is to say encourage as the main rule but -- that is, if we have to leave it to the judge's discretion but we want to rein in that discretion so that you don't have arbitrary differences going from one judge to another? They want -- they want to say, yeah, we wanted this to be discretionary with the judge, but we want to install certain controls so that the trial judges will be operating more or less uniformly.                 How could they do that constitutionally?               The juries are find -- that's what is going on now, the juries are part of this trial of guilt?               Which is it?      Do they do it in the guilt trial or leave that up to the judge?               Where -- where a defense attorney might not want all of that stuff to come out.                 It held as far as the State constitution went, this is fine.                   It's only the Federal Constitution that stops the legislature from doing this.                 One way of -- if you are right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to the judge's discretion.         However, before the judge makes a sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of the following factors.        That would be okay?
07-9712 +++$+++                As a matter of practice among U.S. attorneys, we do have six and a half years at stake here, right?      That's the difference between the two levels?    Why wouldn't it be the appropriate thing for the U.S. attorney, the assistant U.S. attorney, to say, "Judge, I want to call your attention to paragraph 8 of the plea agreement.           At the time we entered into it, we made that undertaking."                And so then everybody is sure that the judge's mind is focused on that.                Wouldn't that be the better practice?              It was sent to another judge, that judge would still have the presentence report.   After all, it wasn't the government that initiated reneging on the -- if it was the -- it was the presentence report.      And before the government said a word, the judge had read and was discussing the presentence report, which said, judge, earlier, we said you should give credit for acceptance of responsibilities, now we must tell you, you should not.                 Yes.
07-984 +++$+++                   -- your description of that effect?     The other solution we were told would involve filling in a vast expanse of wetlands and then having these huge piles that could be seen by all the tourist boats.
07-9995 +++$+++               Then -- then you would have no objection to a remand that says, Illinois Supreme Court, you can't blame it on Federal law.                        It's up to you as a matter of State law.                      And now answer the question that you didn't answer; that is, what is the consequence under State law of an erroneous denial of a peremptory?    You would have no objection to such a remand?                But what about the --                Mr. Roberts, if you do get to harmless error, how do you deal with the question that was raised by the Chief Justice, that is, there is no way in the world that you can tell whether this was harmless or not?   You would have to imagine another juror being on the panel, that juror could have swung the case, could have had no influence, there is just no way of knowing what would happen.
08-1008 +++$+++            New York doesn't have -- as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any anti-class action as a procedural policy.         It has picked out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one where there s -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class action in general, but these penalties that we created, we don't want those brought as class actions.             One -- one question that was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action -- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that says we love class actions and we want class actions to be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23 requirements?             But it could be -- it could be, as I -- the example of the statute of limitations.     We create a claim.              It has a certain life. It's dead after that time.              That's New York law. A sister State may say, we create the same claim, but we think it has a longer life.                 New York would say, that's fine.         Bring that claim in your own State.   Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State claims when we would not hear the identical claim under our own law. There are policies that do operate as procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust.             New York might well say, look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we are not going to entertain the sister State claim for any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own.                 We are not frustrating the sister State.              They could bring the class action there, but not in -- not in our courts.           Well, they -- they bring up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a class action from a State court to a Federal court, but they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the Federal court.
08-103 +++$+++              In -- aren't there statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the EEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until you have gone to X administrative agency?              And those are not considered jurisdictional.              I thought that -- that last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has authority to decide this particular issue, copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen not to enter the suit.        The sentence simply says, court, you have authority to decide this question.             Isn't it true, though, that -- that most copyright holders, most people who write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only $65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically worthwhile?    So I think it's a fact that most copyrights are not registered, isn't it?                Do they -- if they are just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they have to register before bringing an injunction suit?              The -- so mingle -- rule. I think Ms. Anders answered that question.                In this situation it would be appropriate for the judge to accept the waiver.               If we -- if we are talking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for infringement apart from this settlement in the context that we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that question whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever. What defendant who is sued for infringement wouldn't say, judge, I'm relying on 411(a); they haven't registered their copyright; they can't sue me?                    I can't imagine a defendant in an ordinary copyright case who wouldn't raise it.             Then let's switch to the plaintiff.    If the plaintiff is in it for money, for real money, for damages, the plaintiff's going to register because then the stakes are such that $65 is well worth it, if the plaintiff thinks it can get a large infringement award.              So the rulemakers got it wrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as jurisdictional.   They say copy the 1331, 1338, that is jurisdictional, and then they put the certificate requirement below the line -- below the jurisdictional line. So that was -- well, that was wrong, in your judgment.              I suppose, if you picked up any copyright complaint, you will see the jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and nothing about 411.

08-108 +++$+++                   Mr. Heytens, did the prosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in the district court when Judge Friedman asked:                    Where I take two people and one of them gets false Social Security cards and it happens that the number belongs to no live person, and another person goes to the same outfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live person -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the prosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it turns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on, but if it turns out to be a real number, two years' mandatory addition?       The prosecutor says, yes, that's the difference.   Was that the right answer?                Then what about the -- the even division -- I think it is an even division, 3/3 -- is it a 3/3 split?      And if you wanted one indication that this statute is indeed grievously ambiguous, it is that -- that good minds have reached opposite conclusions with well-reasoned decisions on both sides. So it seems to me that this is a very strong argument that this is an ambiguous statute, unusually so. And I factor into that the answer that was given to Judge Friedman's question, which astonished me the first time I read it:          That the prosecutor would say, Your Honor, I am saying no different degree of culpability.   One happened to get a fictitious number; the other happened to get a real number; two years for the second one.   There is no difference at all in the state of mind of -- of the two defendants.                    That's -- that's why I think the -- the ambiguity argument is strong.   Why in the world would Congress want to draw such a line?               You -- you gave earlier the felony murder example of the one who, the gun goes off, he didn't mean to kill anybody.                    But I thought homicide is -- it's an answer to your argument that this statute was entirely victim-centered, because a person is just as dead if he's the victim of a reckless driver as a premeditated murder, and yet we certainly distinguish the penalties in those cases, no matter that the harm was identical.
08-1107 +++$+++               The problem with your -- your approach -- and California is unique in this respect, is -- California is a very large State, lots of business, and you are comparing to the next State that has the next number of employees -- you know, Florida. If I were entertaining your approach, I would think, well, you would compare California against the whole rest of the nation and not pick for a dispersed -- a corporation that is widely dispersed. California is going to be the big winner in this.   It's going to be able to keep all those cases in its State court because so many multi-State corporations, I imagine, would come out, just the way Hertz does. Am I right, that, under your analysis, the one place where, if you say, we don't want Federal courts to be dealing with corporations that are at home in the State, but in the State of New Jersey, under your view of things, a New Jersey citizen could sue Hertz in Federal court in New Jersey, right?             And why do you say, well -- why is it that the Ninth Circuit's method, California versus Florida, instead of California and let's see what the rest of the business is -- is, in the whole United States?              But they cannot be advised by the State court in New Jersey either.              The -- you correctly pointed out that Congress said place of business.   It didn't even do as it did with -- it didn't do as it did with -- with corporate citizenship, that is you could be a citizenship of as many States as you incorporate in.   But if it's got to be one place, so why not just keep it simple and say presumptively it's the business headquarters, in a particular case you could show otherwise.                But that would be a phony headquarters.    But nobody is suggesting that -- that the headquarters of Hertz in New Jersey, that that's a sham set-up.                Is that phenomenon?   I mean, I can see that as a hypothetical, but does it happen in the real world, that a corporation moves its headquarters in order to escape the Federal courts in a particular State?             But why would they move simply to avoid a Federal court or to gain access to the Federal court in a particular State?             But we are not talking about all.   I mean, that would be -- that's why you make it a presumption, the headquarters is a presumption which could be rebutted.        But you are not talking about all business.   You are talking about California where there is a sizeable amount of business, simply because it's the size of the State, the population of the State. And I would understand your position better if you would say, well, we would measure against the entirety of the United States.             But California is going to come out the winner much more often than any other State under this test simply because of its size.              Where is -- where is its headquarters.
08-1119 +++$+++               What about the provision that says the directors, employees, are not included?              What about an associate?             Well, let's take some of the examples that were in the amicus brief.                One of them was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and she is at the end of the line on resources.               She has her trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but then she won't be able to carry on her business.               And she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt -- since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of bankruptcy. Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell your -- the lawyer could say:              Sell your equipment. That wouldn't be a problem.             But could the lawyer say, incur the debt?              Well, take this circumstance.     There is no other -- the person is on a brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by selling assets or by borrowing.              Suppose she doesn't have a home equity loan.      Suppose she's a renter?             One thing that lawyers who render services for money want -- is to be sure that they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this 526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney for representing the debtor. So what can a lawyer say safely about the lawyer's getting paid?               You said that one of the aspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are not limited to saying, "We are debt relief agencies; we help people file for bankruptcy."                 They can say anything else.   But there's no screening -- there is no administrator that a law firm can go to and say, "This is what I think is substantially similar.                 Is it okay?"
08-1134 +++$+++              It was the only debt. This -- there was no other debt.             Do --             So I take it that you do think the Ninth Circuit was wrong when they said: bankruptcy judges, don't stand in the middle of these arrangements.      Because you -- your answer was you think the bankruptcy judge does have the obligation to bring out this requirement that -- of a hardship showing?              But did you -- the net effect of this is if you have taken a debt that is non-dischargeable and put it into the category that it is dischargeable unless the creditor objects.              The -- the code puts the onus on the debtor to raise the hardship question. Your reading is, even if the debtor is silent, totally silent, says nothing about hardship, unless the creditor objects, then the discharge will be proper; the plan can be confirmed.                 So you are taking a burden that Congress has put on the debtor and switching it to the creditor.               But it s in a category that s labeled  non-dischargeable.                 There were other items in that -- that category, so let's take it that -- the child support arrears --               The debtor says, look, I'll pay half of what I owe, and the spouse says, I need something for the children, I'll take it.                And then the plan is confirmed, with only half of the child support; and then the caretaker spouse has a second thought and says, 2 years later, I need that money, I'm going to go after the debtor for the rest.               But let s suppose -- this is my hypothetical.     It's right in there, and the -- the creditor haven t gotten all the notices -- I want what I can get right now.    So I'll make this deal.            Well, there are supposed to be additional notices here.           There s supposed to be a summons and complaint and all that.               And let's go down the list of the others.      How about taxes?            So you re saying any of these things that are listed as non-dischargeable can become dischargeable unless the creditor --            -- objects?            So then, why do we have this third category, then?         Nothing is non dischargeable.            But your answer to me was that if the creditor doesn't object, even to a non-dischargeable debt -- if the creditor doesn't object, it's discharged.        That's what you answered, I thought.            And it doesn't matter whether it's child support, taxes, or student loans, right?     Anything in the category -- you re saying the creditor must object; otherwise it's covered by the discharge.              But that's not -- their position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this -- it puts it outside the discharge order.             The discharge order does not cover this kind of debt.             It doesn't discharge student -- student loans absent a hardship determination. So, what they are saying is the discharge discharged other things, but it could not discharge this particular debt, so it's not discharged.             And I'd like him to answer the question that I asked him first.
08-1175 +++$+++                Well, how about the reasonable defendant in this very case?                Powell's lawyer questioned him and asked him:                "You waived the right to have an attorney present during your questioning by the detectives?" Answer:     "Yes." This is at appendix page 80.             So, apparently, counsel understood the warning to have conveyed the right to have an attorney present during questioning by the -- by the detectives.                Counsel understood that?               Did she ever --             Was she asking her client a legal question?   You waived the right to have an attorney present during your questioning by detectives, is that what you are telling the jury?            But do --            Do you think that a suspect would think, now, I'm in this custodial room, they want me to stay put, that they re going to have me hopping in and out of the room to talk to my lawyer? Wouldn't the assumption be, I'm stuck in this room, they are holding me here, and if I have a right to talk to a lawyer, it's got to be there and not my walking in and out of the holding room.            What do you do with the -- the Court s decisions in Prysock and Duckworth that dealt with the right to appointed counsel and the suspect was not explicitly told that he had a right to appointed counsel at the pre-arraignment stage.                  It said something about a court would give you --            You wouldn't have to have any additional information; you just tell them, you have a right to have a -- have counsel now.                That would be fewer words.            Didn't one of them say "court," and the suspect was not in court at the time?            Yes.     That the court will appoint counsel for you.                Well, they are -- they are free to do that.      I mean, politically, they might consider it risky, but if we say that the charge was good enough, the Florida court could say, but it's not good enough under our Constitution.             I think --             But they did say over and over again -- one was the certified question; another was the issue before the court is whether the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during custodial interrogation violates the principles espoused in Miranda, with the citation. I mean, they said many, many times that the question was -- what did Miranda mean was the issue, not what -- what did Florida's extension of Miranda.             I think you would have had a much weightier argument if it hadn't been for Michigan v. Long.    If you could have said --             We could have then remanded to ask the Florida Supreme Court:            Was it independently ruling under its constitution?
08-1191 +++$+++               What about the -              Purchased -- purchased or sold?              On the -- on the extraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague on the other side tells us that in all the cases where the presumption applied, all of the conduct was someplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say that was an employee hired in -- was it Saudi Arabia -              -- and everything happened outside the country.              Here, I mean, you have to concede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred in Florida.              Mr. Roberts -              Mr. Roberts, because your time is running out, there is a basic question here. You are asking us to make a distinction between what the SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for. Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors. Is there any other instance in which we have made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the private litigant doesn't?
08-1198 +++$+++                Well, is that what's on 56a of the joint appendix, Construction of the Arbitration Clause?     That's what Mr. Waxman referred us to?               "Upon appointment, the arbitrator shall determine, as a threshold matter."               Yes.     56a.             May I -- may I ask you this question?   Let's assume that you prevail in this case.   I -- I would assume that the tankers are now going to add to their contract, as many contracts do, a provision saying no class action -- you cannot proceed in a class action.     If the arbitration agreement says agreed to arbitrate any and all disputes, but you may not proceed on behalf of a class, would that preclude you from bringing a class action any place?            There are many, many contracts -- and pick up your average credit card agreement -- that will say you may not bring this as a class.            But then you won't get -- you win this case, but then all the future AnimalFeeds lose because they ll just put in the arbitration agreement you can't proceed on class.
08-1200 +++$+++              And also saying -- and then this sentence is what I would like to have your response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute that makes mistake of law a defense.                   So this would be highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.              Could we do that in the context of this case?      Because we are talking on a highly abstract level.       This is a statute that required a validation notice, and for the most part the validation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly the words of the statute. But the lawyer added two words that are not in this statute, "in writing."             Where did that come from?   We are told this was not the model form that was used by the debt collectors' association.              It says you "should" --              Rather than "may"?              But why doesn't that just mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges -- the majority of judges who -- who had held that it didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything. It's just confirming that the majority view is right.              Well, why wouldn't one say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has said that's what those words mean, and then go back to the other statutes and say the same language was used, so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress has just confirmed?                 Didn't Mr. Jay tell us there were seven requests?            Are you disputing that?               This isn't -- this is a class action, wasn't it?         It was brought as a class action?
08-1214 +++$+++           I thought that the union's initial position was that there was no agreement, and it refused to arbitrate.         Isn't that what -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what precipitated this case?          I thought that at that time the union refused to arbitrate.          But, at least now that we have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why isn't that conclusive?          Well, perhaps you can clarify one thing for me.           I thought that these two go together -- two things that go together:         One is the no-strike clause, and one is the arbitration clause.          And you are trying to uncouple them, and so, even though one is quid pro quo for the other, you would say the union wants to keep what favors it, that is the arbitration clause, but reject what favors the employer, that is the no-strike clause. It seems to me that if you have one, you have the other, but you can't say, oh, yes, we have the arbitration clause, but we don't have the no strike clause.            If it's true -- if it's true, which we can take for purposes -- for the current purpose, that the international really did induce the local to continue the strike, you said there's no action in State court because that's pre empted.   Unfair labor practice proceedings is against the local, not the -- not the international.             So there's nothing. It is in your view, you -- you said, well, there s relief against the local, but there s no remedy at all against the international, even if the allegation is true that this strike would never have occurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the international.
08-1224 +++$+++            Do you -- Mr. DuBois, do you take that same position with respect to not guilty by reason of insanity?     Someone is convicted, say, in the District of Columbia -- say, John Hinckley is found by the jury to be not guilty by reason of insanity, must he then be allowed out of Federal custody, and it depends if his home State or any other State wants to pick him up?             And so what's the power that the Federal Government is exercising when it commits someone who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity?          It's more than the question of good idea.        You re talking about endangering the health and safety of people, so it's -          The government has some responsibility, doesn't it?          Yes, but you say, if the State is unwilling to take the person, and apparently, that is the problem that precipitated 4246 and, now, 4248, and that -- you -- the Federal government is just helpless short of passing a spending measure and saying, State, if you do this, we ll give you the money.          Yes, that's one of the things that you mention in your brief.                You said you could vary the conditions of supervised release, but you were not at all specific about that.                You said the Federal Government -- the person has gotten out, they know the person is dangerous, so what -- what are the measures that they would take to do what you said in the brief the Federal Government could do; that is, set the terms of supervised release in order to account for sexual dangerousness?          Well, what would the modification be?          What about someone who is incompetent to stand trial?        I take it you think that that s a perfectly proper application of 4246?          Does it matter that the person who has been found incompetent to stand trial has now been in custody for three times longer than the maximum sentence?          Even though it may be purely imaginary; that is, that this particular person, all of the experts agree, will never be competent to stand trial.
08-1301 +++$+++                 Can you clarify --             Can you clarify what you mean by  the statute comes into effect ?              Because if I understand correctly, there s only one State and one Indian tribe that are in compliance.             But that would be what their --            -- what their old law was. It wouldn't be -- you have -- SORNA is in effect, but what the State is implementing is the pre-SORNA State law, right?
08-1314 +++$+++        Mr. Garre -       Mr. Garre, in -- in Geier I think it was Justice Breyer who called attention to the agency having informed the Court that if tort suits were to go on, at -- in -- in contradiction to the government's view that there should be both of these - that the safety standards that were set there, it would be disturbed.     It would be impeded. And the opinion said we assign weight to the Department of Transportation there, to their view that a tort suit there would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the Federal safety standards.     And if the Court gives weight to what the agency says in Geier, shouldn't it equally give weight here when NHTSA is telling us there is no conflict?     It says its rule sets out what the statute calls for, a minimum standard.       But then the Court - what was the Court doing in saying that?     Was it -- just wanted the agency to feel good?       But there is no such statement.     I mean there was a statement we don't want to impose those costs, but we have the agency in court -- we have the Solicitor General's office in court telling us, the statute says minimum, the statute says the common law isn't displaced, and we are telling the Court that we think this is a situation where it is minimum and so the common law isn't displaced. Shouldn't we assume that the standard that the agency set, that as the agency said is a minimum standard unless the agency tells us that it should be preemptive of tort suits?       Was that in 1989?     I thought there was some advance in the child seats between the early '80s and '89.       Was that in 1989?       If the government doesn't mean what it says the way you do -- we are being told here that far from encouraging Type 1, all along, the government says:     Yes, Type 2 is a better seatbelt.       No, they did say that the reason that we are not making it mandatory is because of some cost benefit analysis.     We don't think we should impose that as a minimum then.       I thought we were told that there was one manufacturer, I think General Motors was mentioned, that was doing this Type 2 belt uniformly?
08-1322 +++$+++               I --              In exchange for getting 25 percent of the recovery?              My understanding is that the ordinary payment to the lawyer for Social Security benefits gained for the client is 25 percent of the recovery to the client paid directly to the lawyer.              So that, just as a background in this case, did Ms. Ratliff get that 25 percent?              And that was because it was too small to be bothered with?                   What was the reason?              And she could keep only one from the --              She could keep only the larger of the two.              One of the difficulties with your position is that Congress did exempt a number of Federal payments from the offset, but it didn't exempt Equal Access to Justice fees.               In what percent of the Social Security cases where the claimant prevails is there an EAJA fee?              Because there was no offset in the picture because the government wasn't offsetting.               But Congress has provided in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, 406, that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the attorney.   Here it used different language; it said pay the prevailing party.
08-1332 +++$+++               Why is -- why is that so? I mean, it did say associated equipment.                 And -- and if an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we re warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager?               But my question is, an employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are going to be subject to being monitored --               Wouldn't that employee expect that the policy would carry over to pagers?                  I mean, would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply?              I thought that he said -- he was saying:     But as far as billing is concerned, I'm not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000 characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end of it.     If you contest that, then I ll look to see whether those in excess of 25,000 characters were for work purposes or private purposes. And so he's talking about the billing.                      He hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that these text messages are subject to audit.               Did he say "we"?         He -- even Quon didn't say that.      Duke said he wouldn't do it.               But earlier, the -- at the meeting, the statement was made that these are open to audit.             Didn't say only by Lieutenant Duke.              I thought the policy was limited personal use.              But the -- the notice was we re going to treat these just like e-mails, and e-mails were limited personal use.
08-1341 +++$+++              Convicted, but not -- there was a possibility, but not a reasonable possibility.     That is, it's conceivable, but the government also is urging the reasonable possibility that it is not likely, given the character of the evidence in the post-enactment period.              Justice Kennedy suggested that, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, it would have come in to show pattern, scheme.              So it's one -- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not have seen that evidence, would not have heard the evidence, and another to say the judge should have charged them:    Now, you cannot use this evidence that you've heard for another purpose.            You cannot use it to determine his guilt or innocence.            What is your position that two concurring judges said that evidence should not have been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the jury should have been told you can convict only on post -- whatever the date was?            But they also pointed out that one of the most severe incidents fell in the post-enactment period.       It was in April of 2001.             It was -- and that was vivid evidence properly -- properly used by the jury to determine guilt or innocence.             So your position is, essentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area; it's just error because it involved evidence pre-enactment?    That error is enough; it doesn't have to meet --             It doesn t have to meet the standard for plain error?
08-1371 +++$+++               But you -- Mr. Garre, you did say that the evidence is the dean's deposition. There s no prior evidence.             But there are schools, including law schools, that have this policy.                      Is that not so?               It's also the --               -- the university's across-the-board rules for all student conduct against disruption, against incivility.                 The list would certainly carry over.               That was the predecessor group.              Is -- was there any proof in this record?     I mean, there s a stipulation for summary judgment.     Was there any proof showing that it wasn't evenly applied?              Mr. Garre, the -- the so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it?              The categories that are listed there are the categories that under California law are proscribed bases for discrimination?
08-1394 +++$+++             What was -- Mr. Dreeben, what was the jury told when this honest services count was given to the jury?        What was -- what were they told was the definition --            Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify the issue that came up:           Is the government's theory focused simply on the compensation or does it involve the sale of shares?
08-1402 +++$+++           Yes, but there you were dealing with an express exemption.                There was an exemption for a woman, and also in the record was that the jury clerk was sending out notices saying:                   Women, if you do not wish to serve, return the summons to the judge named on the reverse side as quickly as possible.    And then, further -- systematic -- if the card was not returned, if a card sent to a woman was not returned, it was automatically assumed that she did not wish to serve.      There was no follow-up. So there was all kinds of evidence of systematic problems in Duren that are not present here.          Where did the Court say that?          Oh, that was after -- that was after showing the systematic factors.                 It was the plaintiff's burden -- or the defendant in the case, Duren -- burden to show there was a systematic factor.   That was the automatic exception for a woman and how it worked in practice.            After all of that, then Justice White tells us, the State could still come back and say yes, that's true, but there were other reasons why women didn't show up.            Maybe they were disproportionately elderly, or maybe they were involved with child care. That's what -- that's what Duren said, that the -- showing a systematic factor was the plaintiff's burden, and then the State could justify why the numbers came out that way.          Where does it say that?          Where does it say that?           May I stop you there for a moment?    Because one of the things that was in the Duren opinion was that a child care excuse would be okay.    I think Justice White said at the end, now, I'm not touching the typical hardship excuses, and one of them was child care, and that is -- certainly, in the early '70s, was going to disproportionately affect women.   You have far fewer women if you give a child care exemption.           But this -- he wasn't talking about individual cases.          Is there -- is there a Federal district that corresponds to this Kent County? Is there a Federal district court that would be calling jurors in -- in the same geographical area?          But you don't have -- you don't have comparable -- comparable records for what was going on in the -- in the district court?          Yes.          Can we go back to your point about -- that there was a big change when the draw came from the circuit first, before the districts.     I thought it was agreed that, before, there was an 18 percent, on average, comparative difference and, after, 15 percent.                 That doesn't sound like a big change.           That was a question of what was permitted.     Here you re trying to say this is required.    The school s case was, these are measures the district could take if it wanted to.              But you are saying these are measures the district must take because the Constitution requires it.              They are quite different settings.
08-1423 +++$+++        Mr. Panner, can you answer Mr. Englert's point what earthly sense would it make to prefer goods that are manufactured abroad over those manufactured in the United States?
08-1438 +++$+++        I thought a local government would be subject to damages.     We are talking about the state.       What do you do with the practical problem that's been brought up that if a State is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate?     That the only way that the State is going to take its obligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory damages?
08-1448 +++$+++        But the material wasn't obscene.     They were girlie magazines.     I imagine to today's children they would seem rather tame -       -- the magazines involved.     But they were definitely not obscene with respect to adults.       But on that -- on that score, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC.     The question is whether violence can be restricted during the hours when most children are awake, just the way pornography is.     I don't remember what -- what are the hours, that -- something like from 10:00 in the evening until - I don't -- but -- but didn't the FCC say, yes, we could do the same thing for violence that we're doing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it; we think Congress should do it?
08-1457 +++$+++               Is your point that official acts done stay in effect even though the official is gone, until the official's successor in office is appointed and that successor can remand the instruction?              How -- how has it -- how has it worked?   And I understand that they are not dealing with controversial decisions.                   How many decisions are there now?              There are -- there are two nominees, are there not?              Three?
08-146 +++$+++                Then you might say that they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be granted, but that is the merits question.                 We are supposed to be dealing with the question of whether the denial of the stay -- there was a denial of a stay -- is appealable under section 16.              And to decide that question I don't think you get into how meritorious their claim was for the stay.                  You -- you just told us that section 3 was ambiguous.               You don't know if the reference to "parties" means parties to the arbitration agreement or parties in the litigation.                   So how can we take it -- we take it seriously, yes, and say there's an ambiguity.   We don't know from the text which is the proper reference, parties to the agreement or parties to the litigation.              But you would recognize that there is some appeal possibility, because you already said or at least you said in your brief that the 12 might -- let's get this question settled about the equitable estoppel and going to arbitration; That the district court in its discretion that could give a 1292(b) order and say I want to get this issue settled on appeal before I go on with the case.              That would be all right.              Well -- the district judge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b) issue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court of appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is?                  Bricolage did move to compel, it did move for a stay, did make a section 3 application; and then it -- it became bankrupt and got the benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy.                But I take it that Andersen and Curtis are saying we have a right to be substituted for Bricolage.           That's --
08-1470 +++$+++             Then you re saying then that the defendant has to -- never has to invoke his right?   That --            Was the Miranda warning adequate in this case?       He got the four warnings, but then, unlike some police forms that then ask the defendant, do you waive your rights, this form never asked, did you waive your rights?            It just said:         Do you acknowledge that we have informed you of your rights?
08-1498 +++$+++              But it isn't--             -- whatever way they wish.   They re making clear that it's only in connection with lawful activity of the group, and indeed it's to train them in using lawful means to achieve their end. And I thought you went further than saying there has to be strictly independent advocacy.             You recognized in your brief that they could meet with members of these terrorist organizations.              They could meet and communicate with them, but they can't communicate advice on how to pursue their goals through lawful means?               But you -- but you --            You say that the -- not only the membership, but they can meet and they can discuss.   And I don't understand the line between meeting with these terrorist organizations, discussing things with them, and instructing them on how they can pursue their goals through lawful means.             What's involved here -- I think they said that they want to train them how to do lawful things, how to pursue their goals in a lawful, rather than a terrorist, way.              And that is speech.   It is not conduct.          They want to engage in advocacy of peaceful means of achieving the goals of these groups.             But they want to communicate, and you say they can communicate.               And I still am having trouble with the line of what they can communicate and what they can't.             The answer on the other side is:     All we want to do is speak about lawful activities.     We re not supplying any guns, any communication equipment.        We just want to speak about lawful activities. And I go back to my failure to understand your line between, yes, you can communicate with these people, but you can't communicate about going about their aims through peaceful means.              So you can -- you can communicate, but the communications are censored.               That s -- you said you can meet with -- you can be a member, you can attend meetings, you can discuss things, but there are only -- there s a certain point at which the discussion must stop, right?             Does this -- what -- what these plaintiffs are seeking to do -- does it have any resemblance to the 150 prosecutions that you have brought under this Act?     It was my understanding that those were for supplying weapons, supplying other equipment.   Are there any prosecutions that are -- that aim at training to pursue the organization's aims through peaceful means?
08-1521 +++$+++             I thought that Heller -- Heller allowed for reasonable regulation.            I thought that the Heller decision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a few examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned.
08-1529 +++$+++          Now, that's quite a surprising statement for you to make, when the very first statute that Carlson mentions is 233(a).         Yes.         Well, it certainly doesn't get that out of the way.          It's put on page 20, because one of the reasons why Carlson enables   allows the Bivens Act is that it doesn't contain language and the -- and it -- it seems to me that this -- that this paragraph is contrasting statutes with Carlson, because in Carlson there is no -- there is no other statute.              That's just (a).   We re just talking about (a).            What -- what says "entire subject" -- 233(a), where does that say anything other than -- I mean, it reads like it's immunity from any civil action.   That's -- those are the words I think that you have to overcome.        It says:       Plaintiff has a substitute remedy against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and the employee is immune from any civil action.   And then you say, but any civil action doesn't include Bivens actions.             And you must be saying that the later Act shrinks the former Act.            It amended 233(a) --             -- without mentioning it?             So the Gonzalez Act is after Bivens.             But you say the same thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act?          The Westfall Act could be read to say we re now covering all these people who did not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but this amendment saves out Bivens claims.            One could read that as self-contained and not touching other statutes that existed independently before.
08-1553 +++$+++ 
08-1555 +++$+++              Ms. Millett --   -- I thought your point is, if the relief is against the state, it doesn't matter who you name as the plaintiff.             Whether it's injunctive relief or money relief, if the relief is against the state, obviously, you can't dodge it by naming the officer instead.             Ms. Millett, do you agree with the --            Do you agree with the government that it's the government's advice -- the government said, in the old days, the Tate letters went out in all these cases.              Now, they no longer go out when we re dealing with a state itself or a state agency, but we still -- the Executive -- basically, as I read the government's position, the government is saying:    The Executive Branch decides.            We tell the court.    And if we don't tell the court that this person can be sued, then the person can't be sued. Are you in sync with the government in that we are now back to the Executive -- essentially, the Executive decides, not the court?              Mr. Kneedler --               This is -- it's now many years, and we still don't -- the State Department has said in effect:     We decide. Can you tell the Court, is this defendant amenable to suit or is there an immunity that would cover him?
08-1569 +++$+++             How about the short -- what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the short-barreled rifle?       That's -- that's -- those two are together in the statute, and you said that it would be startling because of the difference between 10 years and the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a sentencing factor.               Now, they have to because that's what Harris said, brandished --              -- brandished is a sentencing factor.
08-192 +++$+++                   But if he leaves a message?                  In this case we have two separate episodes, each involving one gram of cocaine?               And there were a total of seven phone calls?               So that would be an exposure --               24 years for the one gram of cocaine on two occasions. Do you agree that it doesn't make any difference who initiates the call?                   That is, if the seller says -- seller calls the buyer, and says, I understand that you are in the market for one gram of cocaine, I'll sell it to you, is the buyer similarly subject to this statute?               Yes, we are assuming the purchase is made in either case.               So what you're saying is it doesn't matter who initiates the call?                 But we do know that -- that Congress drew a line it hadn't drawn before between the own-purpose users and people who were in the trafficking business, and it expressed sympathy for the -- or leniency, a policy of leniency. But the difference between the classification felony and misdemeanor is huge in terms of consequences for a person's life.                      So let's take the defendant in this case.         If he becomes a felon rather than a misdemeanant, even if it's his first time and it's only one gram, he loses a lot of rights, doesn't he?                 Yes, but I'm speaking about the post consequences.                 Like -- let's take a young person.    It has an effect on student loans, government loans?               And it may be that in certain States voting rights are removed, and there is on this person's record forever that he is a felon.              It just seems odd that Congress would have at one and the same time, the same statute, say, we want these -- to give these people a chance and if they are in a rehabilitation program and they make it they won't even get any charge, not even a misdemeanor charge, and then say, but a whole group of them are going to be treated just like traffickers if they use a telephone. It's hard -- these two would seem to be working at odds with each other.              So mustn't the Court then try to reach some accommodation, some harmonization of these two provisions?        And it's suggested that we do that by saying facilitation, causing in this context means the same thing as aiding and abetting, then we have the buyer-seller rule for the aider and abettor, and then we have made these two provisions harmonious.              What about the -- the statement that in the manual -- maybe this is incorrect -- but that the charging policy of the Department of Justice instructs prosecutors to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts?             And if that's true, then the Assistant U.S. Attorney would have no choice.   The most serious offense is not misdemeanor simple possession, but it is the violation of 843(b).              Ordinarily --              Is that the policy, first of all?   It says that they're supposed to charge the most serious offense supported by the facts?              So that means in every one of these cases, whether the dealer picks up the phone or the buyer picks up the phone for a transaction for one gram of cocaine, the prosecutor has no choice but to indict under 843(b)?               I'm talking about the choice between misdemeanor, simple possession misdemeanor, or 843 -- adding on this 843(b).                The prosecutor -- if what I read is correct -- has no discretion, has to if he makes the charge.                He cannot make a simple misdemeanor charge.                He has to charge the felony.              How does it work?   I mean, I know your overall rationale about the ease of detection -- easier to detect face to face encounter on the streets.    But here, I mean, we know that the government tapped the dealer's phone, and that's how the government got the list of the people who bought from the dealer.    How common is it that -- the either the buyer or the seller is the subject of a telephone tap?              But what had to be met in this case in order to put this tap on the dealer's phone?               Well, you would interpret Congress -- now we're getting away from '56, when simple possession was a felony, to '70, when simple possession becomes a misdemeanor.         And you're saying that Congress meant to relegate the simple possessor to misdemeanor status, but only if the encounter was face to face.                   So you're reading into the -- what Congress did to sharply distinguish between traffickers and users, and say but that was only taking 843(b) into account.                 That benefit -- that you're not going to be a felon; you're going to be a misdemeanant -- is only for face-to-face transactions.               But I'm talking about this context, the purchase of one gram of cocaine on one occasion, nothing more.               So Congress's design was we treat as a less grave offender the buyer for his own use, but only if he buys in a face-to-face encounter. That's what -- what you would have to read -- you would have to limit the line Congress drew between traffickers, on the one hand, and possessors for their own use, on the other, that it applies only to drugs purchased in face-to-face encounters.               But I mean, practically --               -- the difference between being labeled a misdemeanant and being labeled a felon is an enormous difference.
08-205 +++$+++               So --                In that respect, it's unlike the union, because the -- the worker who does not want to affiliate with a union cannot have funds from his own pocket devoted to political causes.                 But there is no comparable check for corporations.                Does that mean that unions should be taken out, because there isn't the same -- the shareholder protection interest doesn't -- there is no parallel for the union?             May I ask you one question that was highlighted in the prior argument, and that was if Congress could say no TV and radio ads, could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign biographies?    Last time the answer was, yes, Congress could, but it didn't.       Is that -- is that still the government's answer?              But this -- this statute doesn't cover.   It doesn't cover books.
08-214 +++$+++               How many of these seamen who seek maintenance and cure are represented?                  I mean, what is the incidence of representation for maintenance and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of large recoveries for pain and suffering?               Well, the -- the point you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent basis would get a piece of that.               Because it would be swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not available in maintenance and cure.                It hasn't come before this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the punitive damage question?                And that -- that was not argued by anybody.      It wasn't raised in the lower court. It wasn't a punitive damages case.                 There -- there wouldn't be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and medical expenses.
08-22 +++$+++               How is it -- is it -- this Court's decision in the Republican Party of Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a legislator.    Are you extending that notion that an election is an election to this area of the appearance of impropriety?    I mean, is it your position that the judge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and legislators all the time are beholden to interest groups?              Why --                 What about the view that Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause? Wasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the company, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action insisting on that very point, that in recusal matter -- -                 -- it wasn't -- well, maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was.               It was a charge --              But it was the position that Blankenship took?              Would you please clarify that?   Because I was taking appearance, likelihood, probability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice Marshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a grand jury, and he said that due process is denied in circumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance of bias.   And there are other decisions, too, that use those terms interchangeably.              So I don't know that probability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance -- that -- those seem to me synonyms.               May I ask you -- I mean, there were a few recusal motions in this case.               Judge, I think it was Matthew, moved to disqualify Judge Starcher, and Justice Starcher did indeed recuse himself.   He had spoken out against what went on here. If he had refused to recuse after speaking out as he did, would that be compatible with due process, the due process owed to the Massey Company?               I thought the animosity was directed at Judge Benjamin?               So you think the Constitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you think due process might have been violated if that judge had remained on the bench?               We don't deal with an abstract setting.    We have the setting of elections, of elections of judges and millions of dollars spent on them.   That's the context in which this case arises.
08-240 +++$+++            Mr. O'Neil, I thought that there were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the tenant is not required to leave the premises because, as awful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to go.           Is there -- is there any area of the law, other than this one, if you are right, in which a termination includes a non-termination; that is, where a constructive termination includes situations where the operation continues?           And you didn't -- you didn't -- well, you sought an injunction, but Judge Zobel thought it was -- it came much too late.           Can you explain to me -- the question I brought up before -- what was the difference of the elements between the recovery that the jury gave for constructive termination and for breach of contract?
08-267 +++$+++               But you are making -- I thought that the core of your argument is that the All Writs Act applies to all courts established by Congress, the military courts are included in that definition, and there is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it doesn't apply to the military.              But the All Writs Act requires that the writ be in aid of the court's jurisdiction.   So if you would spell out how the writ here is in aid of the military court's jurisdiction.              Where?        Colorable --                 But was -- that question wasn't resolved, was it?          I thought we were just talking about the authority of the military courts to issue this writ, and the question that Justice Breyer has raised, well, is this ineffective assistance of counsel adequate grounds to issue the writ?           I thought that question was certainly not raised before this Court.               Military courts now since 1950 have quite a record of saying coram nobis is available in these courts.          However, they have routinely thrown out the cases on the merits.                     Is there any case within the military where the military has said anything like inadequate assistance of counsel qualifies as a reason to grant the writ?                 Do I understand correctly that since 1989 there were a total of 30 coram nobis petitions filed, and of those only 4 were granted?                 Yes.               But this Court has never held that the military courts have habeas jurisdiction?               In what case?               But that was --                The --                The quote you referred to from Goldsmith says:       "And a servicemember in custody." So I think Goldsmith, in that footnote that you're citing, is presenting a service member still in custody, having exhausted all other areas, can come to a Federal district court and seek habeas.               It's not talking about someone who is out of the military.               Well, what am I missing? I thought that the footnote reads once a criminal conviction has been finally reviewed within the military system a service member, having exhausted all other areas, can petition in a Federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.        I don't see anything that talks about someone who is no longer a service member.
08-289 +++$+++               That's the new plan that we're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references -- well, now they have a new plan.                Does everybody agree at least that the new plan is 2064?                  But couldn't the district court give them the relief to which they were entitled even if it was less than what they sought?               But the district -- the district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough, it raised it to 450 or whatever.              And the district court said there are three things wrong with it, the two years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough. And the only way that $450 figure was going to get changed was through legislation, right?
08-295 +++$+++               Can you answer the question practically, the insurers would not have settled, there would have been no 1986 order, if they didn't have this broader liability?                      They say without global protections they never would have contributed to the trust fund.    And I would like you to answer that question.              Yes, in the -- at the time of 1986, there were many claims against Manville, of course, for Manville's liability.                     These later suits in State court about the insurance company's independent obligation -- I asked this to counsel on the other side -- to what extent was there such litigation in 1986?
08-304 +++$+++                  Let's begin at the beginning, and that is with the first phrase with the, what is it, "civil, criminal, administrative hearing." Do you as the government -- do you agree with the government that you have to insert "Federal" there, too? Or does that phrase --                 -- include States?              Suppose -- suppose it isn't?    Suppose the general "civil, criminal, administrative" is read to mean -- include State.                 Why shouldn't the second, if it we are picking Latin phrases, be read in pari materia?               Why -- what was the reason for that be, given that there are so many joint Federal-State grant programs, like the one that's involved here?   Why wouldn't a State report be as much of a public disclosure as a Federal report?              I mean, we are told that this particular report was filed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.              This audit report is required by Federal law, isn't it?              Let me go back to the other Latin phrase.      If you begin at the beginning and you begin with a phrase that you have no reason to say is modified by Federal, "civil, criminal or administrative proceeding," why shouldn't that drive the statute, what's in the first phrase?                Well, it's a lot hard to say you have to put a caret mark and say -- vidi -- means Federal civil, criminal and administrative hearings.             There was an explanation for it in the opposing brief, that Congress in -- what was it -- 1986 didn't think that the legislature was generating reports, audits, as distinguished from administrative agencies.             Well that -- that doesn't follow like the night the day.              It could be, as it was explained, they didn't include State legislatures because they didn't think they would be generating relevant material.               I think the question was has the Department of Justice, recognizing that there's a circuit split this very question recommended that Congress amend the statute in this particular --               Do you think that the -- when a -- when State employees want to immunize themselves from fraud, they are going to say, okay, we will disclose it where anybody --a prosecutor could pick it up, but we will take care of the qui tam obligation.             But there's lots of disclosures -- there's lots of disclosures in Federal reports that the government isn't pursuing.
08-305 +++$+++                 Mr. Salmons, I thought that the -- the courts, the district court, will not provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two things are shown.    One is that the school district did not provide an adequate education for this child.               And two, that the private school did, and then there are equitable considerations.                 So you must find both, not just that the private school was a good place, but that the school district did not offer an adequate education for the child.                 But procedurally we -- we know that there is a provision addressed to a court for equitable relief.    The question was put before:               Where does the hearing officer get the authority to order tuition reimbursement?        Because the statute on which you rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.              I thought in 2001 even the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't want to put him in special education?                 But we are talking about two different things.        I think the Chief was talking about putting the child in special education, and keeping the child there for 10 days.                     You are talking about the school district that says "no special education; this child is not eligible."                 And the parents -- I think you agree that the parents would have the burden of showing both that the school did not provide an adequate education, an appropriate education, and that the private school does?               The district court doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is done.               And so it would be odd to have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.                Is the department --                Does the -- does the department have a regulation that says the hearing officer may order the private school -- the parents to be reimbursed for private school tuition?               Because it's not in the statute.               Or there could be, I suppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a certain amount would be the parents' responsibility.
08-310 +++$+++                   But the people's homes only if they are affixed to the property and they --                  Yes.              But Wheeling -- Wheeling was, it was a general property tax.                     And as I read the case, it said if you are going to tax property, you can include vessels.   This statute, and I think the Alaska Supreme Court treated it discretely, is a tax on one kind of property only, these vessels.                    I don't know of any other property tax that is confined to just one type of property.   Is there another?             Is there a comparable tax that is focused on a single category of property?                But is it -- do you -- do you contest the point that was made in the reply brief that back at the end of the 18th century, tonnage was considered a proxy for value, that it was the customary mode of measuring the value of a ship?               So as long as you are taxing on the basis of the value of the ship, then you have no Tonnage Clause problem.               Is that your -- the Tonnage Clause was a specific type of measure, and if you're taxing based on the assessed value of the property, it isn't a Tonnage Clause.                     Is that your --              But we have said --                Mr. Olson, we -- we have said it's not just tonnage.            It said that the clause bars states, we said, from imposing a charge even if not measured by a vessel's tonnage, for the privilege of entering, trading in or lying in a port.                So we have ruled out the position that it's got to be an old-fashioned tonnage charge, and can't be based on the assessed value of the property.                But -- but in all of those cases the vessels were being taxed as one item of property in a general moveable property, personal property tax.   I asked you before, I think, is there any other tax like this, that -- an ad valorem tax that is applied to one single category of property?                This statute deals with one category of property.           Is there another statute like this one?               That was the other, the State taxes were no part of the Alaska Supreme Court's decision in this case.               And on what else?    In that -- in that tax that was before the port.              What else did Wheeling tax?
08-322 +++$+++              We have -- we have before us the representations of the county in which the district is located, and of several of the covered jurisdictions, that they don't seek bailout because they think that the benefits, many of which have nothing to do with districting, outweigh whatever burden preclearance puts on them.           It's first, bringing minority groups into the discussion of what the change will be in the first place, and then warding off the kind of examples that appear in the -- in the Louis -- I think we -- we can't impugn their integrity by saying that that host of reasons, having nothing to do with redistricting, is why they are not asking for bailout.              Why --               And the number is 18 now?             But the question is, do you agree that this is unlike access to buildings by people who are in wheelchairs?              There has to come a point where it will end, and perhaps Congress was just picking up on what this court said a few years before in the University of Michigan law school case, this court came up with a 25-year figure so maybe Congress thought this court thinks 25 years is about right, must be about right.
08-351 +++$+++             Mr. Peters, I think the Court in Geraghty said it split the interests.                 And they said his interests in challenging the denial of class action status continued even though he was no longer incarcerated. So they were concentrating on his right to appeal the denial of class action certification.                  And that's what you don't have here.            And that s what distinguishes this case from Geraghty.            But we must take it as it came into the Seventh Circuit, which is no appeal from the denial of class certification.                So we have individual plaintiffs who are seeking to overturn the denial of injunctive relief.            And that's all that's before the Seventh Circuit.               I thought that -- I thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash. So that -- which we are told is 85 percent of the seizures involved.               Right.            Isn't that one of the problems with the Seventh Circuit decision?           That it covers the waterfront.     It covers cash, as well as any property.   It s not concentrated on cars. And what your complaint asks for -- you said it was as applied, but you are asking for a declaration that defendants must hold a post-seizure probable cause hearing within 10 business days, and you are asking the Court to enjoin the defendant s current practice of seizing property and retaining custody without a judicial determination of probable cause. That sounds, to me, like a facial challenge to this statute, and you are asking for a declaration that the statute is invalid, not as applied to any particular person.              Where -- where does the Seventh Circuit --             But where you said  - you said that --             -- the Seventh Circuit -- your complaint, you say, is -- you asked for the universe, every kind of property of due process hearing within 10 days or a short period.              But you said the Seventh Circuit narrowed the relief.              And I'm looking at the Seventh Circuit decision, and I really don't see what was narrowed.              I think they left everything open for the district Court.               Where -- where is there any narrowing?
08-441 +++$+++                As I understand the court of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse. Then there's a question of what did she mean by direct evidence?     But I think the Eighth Circuit certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which their decision turned.                 Justice O'Connor.                 Yes. (Laughter.)                But Price Waterhouse deviated -- that was --                We have these two regimes out there.     You are reciting MCDonnell Douglas and say everything should follow that pattern, but to do that you have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave recognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out of Mt. Healthy.                Mr. Schnapper recognized when I asked this question, how does this differ from the prima facie case that you make under MCDonnell Douglas and -- he said:         We don't have to just make a preliminary showing; we have to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the prohibited discrimination was a motivating factor.              But that question -- I think it can't be before us.            We would certainly want to know what the government's position is on it.                And Ms. Blatt was very clear that the government is not taking a position on that issue today.             Your brief in opposition did not so much as mention MCDonnell Douglas.                So how is anybody to think that was at stake, that that regime, which you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you think should be the sole test?              How could that come into this case when it's not in the brief in opposition and, therefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's not in the government's brief?                 But your line is following that same formula.              All those cases are following that litany:         prima facie case, discriminatory reason --              But those weren't -- those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework. And what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive and say in a discrimination case there should be only one regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of persuasion from start to finish.                But that's not what MCDonnell Douglas did.        It's not what the Eighth Circuit did, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up until the brief on the merits. So -- and you also said that Title VII is out of it.    The statute has taken care of it in 1991. Ms. Blatt, I heard her say distinctly that -- that Title VII would be affected.        She urges us not to touch this question.                And I assume -- and I assume the government, because it would certainly be informative to know what the agency responsible for the administration of Title VII thinks of this question.
08-453 +++$+++                   But I thought it is a given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this -- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted. You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is, the State law is governing law.                 But the only enforcer is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but cannot enforce?                But that's because -- because it's picking a rate.              It's not saying there is the Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law that has that rate.       Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies.                  And that is proper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal authorities. The State law, as this picture is drawn for us, is applicable.      It's substantive law applicable to these banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce it.    That seems passing strange.               And do you have an example outside the -- the two you gave us in the National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the Federal authorities enforce?              So do you think the same answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment discrimination.    The State has reason to believe the bank is discriminating in its employment policies, and it wants to examine certain employment records in that connection.    Would you say also that, although New York can prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law, it can't enforce it?              Mr. Waxman, your mention of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion held.   Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably visitorial.    It was a registration regime, where annual fees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State financial agency, and the State monitor could go into a lending organization any time for any reason without any suspicion of wrongdoing.          The only -- so everyone agreed that was a visitorial regime. The sole question was whether the banks -- the national bank's operating subsidiary was to be equated with a division of the national bank.                 That was the only question provided the Court.              And that was in the context of a State law that says, mortgage lending institution, you may not lend unless you register and do all the rest.   That was the context of Watters.                  And I do not think that excerpts from that opinion should be taken out of that context, which was:                   You can't be in this business unless you register with us.               So one could say, yes, the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they can go to court.   But we have here that the State can prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair lending.   And the State wants to go into court and say the bank is violating the State substantive law, which is applicable.               Mr. Waxman, you are talking about lending.      And like depositing, those are core banking activities, but today national banks have a lot of incidental -- they have authority to do things incidental to banking.      Does your restriction of State enforcement extend to those matters incidental to banking?
08-472 +++$+++                 Mr. Eliasberg, I thought that the Ninth Circuit the first time around had taken meticulous care to make certain that the issue of the validity of the statute would not be before the Court in the first round.   Judge Kozinski wrote:                 "We express no view as to whether a transfer completed under Section 8121 would pass constitutional muster, but leave this question for another day." That's on page 104a of the petition. And then the district judge said:                   Yes, I recognize the Ninth Circuit didn't touch the validity of that statute, left it for another day.                  The day has come.   So it is for the first time that the Court is deciding the question of whether section 8121 passes constitutional muster.                I think -- I think General Kagan agreed that they -- the Veterans couldn't substitute some other memorial, if it's going to be a national monument it has to have the government's approval.   And the only one that has the government's approval is the cross.             What about the government's argument that suppose the government took down the cross, gave it back to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, sold them the land in exchange for land of equal value, and then the Veterans said, fine, the cross was ours to begin with.      Now the land is ours, so we just put it back.    If that would be consistent with the injunction? The government now has nothing to do with the cross.    It's all the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and it can't be regarded a sham because it was originally the Veterans of Foreign Wars who put it up, the government didn't put it up.             Then we are talking about something that is rather formal rather than substantial. If -- if all the government would have to do is say, Congress, you didn't get it right.                 You should have just made the land swap.      And then the government would take down the cross in compliance with the injunction, and then it goes right back the next day.                 I think General Kagan recognized that there isn't an example of a final injunction, where, after it's final as it can be, you can come back and say, but, now, I want to reargue the standing question that's already been determined. But there was something that I did want to ask you about, Judge O'Scanlon's opinion.                He said, if -- if you prevail and you are right, what happens in Arlington Cemetery, where there's the Argonne Cross Memorial and the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, both right here in Arlington, what happens to them?
08-479 +++$+++                 Mr. Wolf, one thing should be clarified.      I don't think there's any dispute what was done in the case of both of these girls.                It wasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear. They were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake, stretch the top of their pants and shake that out. There's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is there?               There was no dispute that they asked her to shake her pants and her bra.                Nobody said that they touched -- the school officials didn't touch her, that's a given.         But they did ask her to shake out her underwear.                Do you agree with Mr. O'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and it's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear, that then this would not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment?   He gave an example of a drug where there was a custom of carrying it in a certain way.               It has to be that student.     It can't be that it's customary among students?               But --               But wouldn't the police --               Did the Ninth Circuit --               Did the Ninth Circuit treat this as a jury question?                I'm looking at page 38a. They were quite definite that that was a Fourth Amendment violation.
08-495 +++$+++                But this -- but this defendant did ask, didn't -- he asked the judge.                 Does the judge, when he arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an accountant with the company that was committing the fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him from the restitution order?              So in -- in my very hypothetical --                Even -- even though this defendant did not pocket any gain?                What about the defendant's argument that at least as far as his admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a downward departure?              But the appropriate burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.              That is in the second proceeding, the recidivist, the multiple offender proceeding --              -- the relationship, domestic relationship had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, which is not the standard that the BIA used.               Yes.               Yes, yes.               That's what you're talking about, the alien who is convicted of a qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries -- then comes back illegally.          The difference between two years and 20 years, you admit there you would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt?
08-5274 +++$+++                 It would be the same -- you would give the same answer if the teller grabbed the gun from the robber and it went off?              But your alternate position would apply to the teller as well as the police officer?                  Is there a difference, a practical difference, between the two formulations?
08-538 +++$+++             Now, can you elaborate on this additional -- she -- you said she could have listed something that came to a higher number.            Are you talking about the part of the leftover of the wildcard exemption that she -- she used it for food, didn't she?             Do we know what -- what s --            Here I thought that the trustee got the appraisal before the creditors  meeting, because at the creditors  meeting he said to her, you put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says $17,000.             Mr. Brunstad, do we know what is the division among bankruptcy judges on this issue?   I mean, you are urging that when those columns 3 and 4 match, that's a tip-off that the debtor is claiming the entire property is exempt.              Do we know what is the lay of the land among bankruptcy judges?            But this debtor did know at the creditors  meeting -- she certainly knew that the trustee was claiming the property was worth more than what she listed it as being worth. She could have, at that point -- so she had the notice of what he was thinking.              She could have, at that point, said, I will remove as many items as necessary to bring me safely within the limit.              She didn't do that.
08-586 +++$+++               But the -- the fund adviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did disclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the difference between what were charged mutual funds, what were charged institutional investors, and then explained that the services were different and that justified the difference.    But they weren't trying to think, no, we don't have to come forward with this information.              But did -- but in the Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then there might be cases where it's so out of line.               And he said the comparison would be to other mutual funds.               He excluded the comparison with institutional investors. So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?               What about the petitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did not provide full and accurate information?              And they mention particularly concerning economies of scale, profitability, and several other matters, that what everybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not occurred. Is that a disputed issue of fact or of further inquiry?
08-598 +++$+++                  And the Ohio Supreme Court acting years before Atkins.                The -- wasn't the Ohio Supreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?                And it was dealing with retardation as a mitigator, not retardation as conclusive that there can be no death penalty.                But before you get to whether -- anything like that, you are urging issue preclusion against the winner.              It was a death sentence in this case.   And I am not aware of issue preclusion operating against a judgment winner.                    Issue preclusion is for the party who fought this out and won. Here we have a death sentence.                     So there -- the ultimate determination, whatever intermediate determinations might have been made on the way, like mental retardation exists and was a mitigator, the ultimate judgment is death.            And I am not aware of, in all of issue preclusion, where a judgment winner is precluded.              But the question is what is the issue, and an intermediate finding, say mitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life or death, is not the same issue as if retardation is found, no death penalty.         It's -- it's the ultimate issue in the case that was before the Ohio Supreme Court is, do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators?             That's the ultimate determination, and that's what would have preclusive effect, not the many intermediate findings that may have been made on the way to the ultimate determination of death.               How do you say you have -- you don't find that in the cases when you said to me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue preclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue preclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses, not a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they weighed and they found retardation, but they also found overwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances.            So the ultimate determination of that, of all the courts, is death? I don't see how you get to elevate an intermediate determination -- there are many; some go for one party, some go for the other -- to become the outcome determinative factor.            The outcome determinative factor is that the aggregators outweighed whatever mitigators there were.              But Ashe is about somebody who was acquitted.             He won.          There was no doubt that he won.              It didn't say anything about, well, suppose he didn't win.                We have the factor that you would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly said that here is the rule:              You can't execute the mentally retarded.      However, we are going to leave it to the State to shape the procedure, and what are the elements of retardation?           You would take all that away from Ohio because in a different context, the context of weighing mitigators against aggravators, the Ohio Supreme Court said there was retardation, it is mitigating; however, it was overwhelmed by the aggravators. It's an entirely different operation than, States, here's the rule; the procedure for doing it is up to you.     Ohio didn't have a procedure for doing Atkins.   It couldn't until Atkins was decided.             And now you're saying, oh, Ohio, because you, in the context of weighing mitigators against aggravators, found this mitigator, you cannot shape the Atkins procedure as every other State can.              But the incentive is vastly different, which is an important factor in issue preclusion.    That is, if the prosecutor thinks that there's overwhelming evidence of the aggravators, the nature of the crime, the prosecutor is not going to care so much about, so there is mental retardation as a mitigator; but when it's a difference, when the prosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it thinks that it's got a secure case on the atrocious matter in which the crime was committed, there isn't the same incentive to litigate as there is when it is the ultimate question, not an issue on the way to reaching the ultimate judgment.               Did they admit that as a finding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation had been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?               It was an admission; it couldn't have been a finding of fact.                    You said that that's what the State claimed.              Where is the admission of the State in this State postconviction proceeding that Mr. Bies is mentally retarded?               You told me that this -- that State conceded that the defendant was mentally retarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you.              The very next sentence is as a matter of law -- the law as it was then -- such a person may be punished by execution.                     So, again, it's -- the stakes are quite different.              But that must have been, the page you called my attention to must have been pre-Atkins.              No, no, we're back -- what you called my attention to was pre-Atkins.                    It was the application made to the State court before Atkins which put two sentences together.                 One was the record reveals defendant to be mildly mentally regarded with an IQ of about 69.    As a matter of law, such a person may be punished by execution.           This is all pre-Atkins. So one statement has to be read in the light of what was its significance, and it wasn't the conclusive factor at the time of that motion.                Since Atkins, we're talking about --
08-6 +++$+++                Under oath?     Under oath so that he would be subject to penalty for perjury?              Well, we can ask your opposite, opposing counsel.            We can put it to him point blank.   That's what I thought he said, and we -- we certainly will clarify that.            But there's another possible impediment here to your claim.                 If we assume that there is this constitutional right, and it's available in 1983, this trial was in 1993.                 He brings the 1983 action in 2003.         Counsel told us that this better method of testing has been available since the late nineties. With any constitutional right, there's an obligation of due diligence on the part of the claimant. You can't come in 10 years later, for example, and say -- say there was a tainted juror or something like that. It was -- it -- when you're claiming even evidence that wasn't available at the trial, you have to make the application with due diligence.
08-604 +++$+++               You said, on that point in your brief, that, normally, the carrier will raise the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time the union files its notice of intent to file a submission. What is -- what is the basis?               You didn't give any citation for that.             You say, ordinarily, that's what the -- the carrier will -- would do, and then you are tipped off, and then you put in your evidence about conferencing. What -- what makes you -- what backs up this statement that, normally, carrier raises the absence of conferencing as an impediment at the time the union files its notice of intent?             I thought your position was -- at least I thought I heard you say earlier, that these individual panels do not have rulemaking authority for the board.    I'm looking at something that says, "National Railway Adjustment Board, Uniform Rules of Procedure, Revised June 23rd."              That's put out by the -- the board, the one that you said that is --             And I thought that your -- because there's nothing in this statute, nothing in any regulation, that gives an individual panel the right to proscribe rules of procedure that all parties to these disputes are obliged to follow.                 That -- that authority is vested only in the board, not in the panels.              You did -- you did make an offer of proof as to --              In fact, the panel invited it and you have made it; and then the panel said sorry, it's too late, you have to do it at the time you make your initial filing.
08-6261 +++$+++ 
08-645 +++$+++              Well, you could say -- you can say that the mother did not have full custodial rights.     One custodial right is certainly to determine where the child will live.                And the mother did not have that right with respect to taking the child out of the country.             It's a provision --             If he has the right to say no, don't take the child out of the country, then he has something more than a right of access.              You -- you are talking, well, she has the rights of custody. But because he -- it's not just the court, because it's his consent in the first instance.             He has a right to determine that the child shall not live outside the country of habitual residence.             That is not a right of access.             I thought the statute says the consent of the -- of the other parent.             Well, that s true of custody decrees generally.          We get them modified by a court in the best interests of the child.             So it -- but in the first instance, it says -- it s he has the consent or withholding consent.             And my question to you is, whatever that is, it isn't a right of access?             It just says that the right of access is the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence.             There s nothing about procedure or substance in this; it says this is what right to custody is, and this is what right of access is.             Not according to the -- what is it, the Chilean central authority, you know, the letter that was sent to the Second Circuit, I think in the Duran case.           The -- the authority within Chile that is responsible for the implementation of this Hague Convention said that it regarded that statute to create a custody right for purposes of the Hague Convention.             I thought there was a sentence in there -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- that said that the statute, under Chilean law, amounted to a right of joint custody.             You have -- you have a lady --             -- Elizabeth Butler-Sloss in the Court of Appeal in England, and that was a square holding.             Which are dicta.             All right.    Well, you can take the German constitutional court.
08-651 +++$+++             How do you -- how do you know that?   In this case, Mr. Kinnaird told us the defendant might have preferred to go to trial because he had this defense that he didn't know what was in the packages.             Mr. Long, you said that this is a collateral consequence; therefore, the lawyer has no obligation to advise the client.           But what was remarkable about the case that you rely on, Hill v. Lockwood, is the Eighth Circuit used the distinction between  direct  and  collateral.                  In this Court, the opinion said nothing about  direct  or  collateral ; it just asked the question under Strickland, and it held that Strickland does apply to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.                 But it -- staring the Court in the face was this direct versus collateral, and the Court was totally silent on that. It didn't consider it relevant to its determination.              We are talking on a highly general level, but what's facing us -- this case, is there are certain crimes -- an increased number of crimes that are classified as aggravated felonies, where the rule is, if you are convicted of an aggravated felony, you are out of the country after you serve your time. There s nothing mysterious about that. There s nothing intricate about making that determination.     So why wouldn't a lawyer whose client is an alien have an obligation, when there is an aggravated felony as the charge, to say this will be the consequence?            You keep insisting on the collateral, although you recognized that in Hill v. Lockhart, the Court did not draw that line.              Well, the defendant might say:   I have been in the United States for 40 years.                  I have a family.   I d rather take my chances with a jury and get put away for a longer time because at least I'll be in prison where my children can visit me.
08-660 +++$+++                Why would the judgment have to be vacated?       Even a jurisdictional issue becomes subject to preclusion once you have gone the appeal route --               So even the jurisdictional base can be precluded and not raised on collateral attack.               But there are certain things the government can do, you concede, without intervening?               If the government did decide to take over, the qui tam plaintiff would remain a party --               So why shouldn't it work the other way?   When the government stays out, it's a party -- when the government isn't conducting the litigation, it's a party just as a qui tam plaintiff would be a party.
08-661 +++$+++              May -- may I ask you to go back just one step?         Because you seem to treat this as though the NFLP was formed in 1963 and that was the end of it, but another description is:               Well, it was formed, but then there were some teams that were not in it until later, and there were some other parts, that it has expanded.         What it does has expanded since 1963. So it wasn't one point in time where there was formation, and then if you didn't -- if you re not challenging that, everything else is okay.
08-67 +++$+++                  Why not, when considering what the government did on its second chance?                    It trimmed 5 -- if there were 20 insider trading, on the new indictment, there were 5.              There were 99 counts of laundering, which were trimmed to 8, something within the jury's ken.     But isn't the most likely thing in this case that the jury was simply exhausted?                  Well, you qualify it in your statement of the facts.            Is there any insider information with relation to the insider information charges that is different in any respect from the insider information in connection with the substantive challenge?
08-674 +++$+++              But that's what the court of appeals decided.     Their simple question was Mobile-Sierra binds the contracting parties, and it doesn't -- the rate doesn't stick for anybody else. That's all they decided. And the question that you're asking certainly is looming over this whole case, but it isn't presented to us because it wasn't even dealt with in any way, shape, or manner by the D.C. Circuit.             But I thought one large difference -- I thought Justice Scalia suggested that the rate negotiated by -- in that bilateral agreement, that that rate would not be subject to just and reasonable attack by anyone, that the public interest standard attaches to that rate and FERC can't abrogate it.   It's a rate that's set, it's binding on FERC, and FERC presumably, because it has no authority to abrogate it, could not entertain any complaint that would ask to have it abrogated.             I didn't -- I didn t follow.   I didn't think there was -- was there a Memphis clause in this settlement?            Why shouldn t we tell them that, and then they can pick it up from there?            Because what they did say could be -- have heavy consequences.               We know that that has already happened.     FERC has revised a number of contracts to conform to the D.C. Circuit's idea that it's the parties to the -- to the contract, not the rate that's sheltered by Mobile-Sierra.               That's a very consequential decision, and so we would tell the D.C. Circuit, if we agreed with FERC and the Petitioners on that:   D.C. Circuit, you've got that wrong. Now, there may be other matters, other issues like the ones that you would like us to decide as a matter of first view, but as Justice Scalia has pointed out more than once, we have a question.                  It is the very question that the D.C. Circuit decided.                  Why should we go beyond that?               That's a third standard between just and reasonable and public interest?               You want us to add another tier?               But you are defending the D.C. Circuit's decision?        I mean, you are up here saying that was the right judgment, Sierra-Mobile -- Mobile-Sierra has to do with the two contracting parties.   It doesn't, as the counterargument goes, shelter the rate from any attack by anyone, including FERC.   It's put in terms of FERC cannot abrogate that rate.   But your -- you are defending the position that it's just as between the contracting parties; it's not the rate itself that is sheltered by Mobile-Sierra, because that's what the D.C. Circuit decided?              It didn't say that.
08-678 +++$+++               Mr. Allen has told us that there are very few cases, in fact 11 cases in I don't know how many years, in the Third Circuit.             But are you suggesting that -- that Cohen itself wouldn't come out the same way today if the question of security for costs, whether State or Federal, hadn't been settled?               But that is only in egregious cases.              And how -- how is it -- unless the judge cooperates, it has to be criminal contempt.   It wouldn't be civil contempt.             The judge says, I'm not going to hold you, and --              But mandamus is supposed -- not supposed to be a run about the final judgment rule, and if -- and if Cohen v. Beneficial is available, then mandamus would not lie, right?              Well, you could -- you could seek an interlocutory appeal under 1292(b).             Mr. Kneedler, I think I have this right, but correct me if I am wrong.               I thought in Cohen v. Beneficial, it wasn't just a question that we would like to get this legal question settled, but, in fact, for many plaintiffs if security for costs was something that the Plaintiff has to put up up front, that would be the end of the lawsuit.               It would be the practical end of the lawsuit.               Unlike in an attorney-client privilege, the suit goes on. So Cohen v. Beneficial wasn't simply that this was an important question unsettled under Erie, it is the practical reality that plaintiffs who had to put up security costs would be out of --
08-680 +++$+++               It would make a difference?    Does it make a difference?                If -- we can limit it to the same case.         But here, the reason that the police came back is that they had additional evidence, and so they wanted to ask him, confront him with the new evidence.      It's not the same situation that it was when he was initially questioned.               Why wouldn't he think, I invoked my right to remain silent without a lawyer two years and seven months ago, I will do it again; they will have to stop questioning?             Why wouldn't that be the most likely mindset of the defendant?                  He knew that it worked the first time.       Why should it not work the second time?
08-681 +++$+++                 But the standard is probable success on the merits, and that's not an easy standard.    Irreparable harm and probable success on the merits, both.               And you would expect the standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision.               It says that no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders, period.    That's the end of it. So one wonders whether this would think that the normal standard for a stay would apply.              And then (f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is dealing with something where we understand it.                 It says no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a provision.   But (2) is really puzzling what it relates to, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)?                1 says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of the law.               May I ask just a technical point?               One of the -- the motion to reopen was based on changed circumstances in the Cameroon.    But there was also this independent application for adjustment of his status, which was turned down because it was a successive motion.               My understanding is that that adjustment could not have been asked for earlier because his wife didn't come with -- until after.               Yes, but now he would qualify, except that it's a successive motion.                 So it seems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.                 May I just ask a question?                 This person is married to a citizen, has an American citizen child.                    Is there any way that his status could be adjusted?                    It can't in this procedural situation because it is a successive motion.
08-6925 +++$+++               But there have been rude touchings where there is no danger of physical injuries to the person.    There have been prosecutions in Florida, I understand, for what would be considered a rude touching as opposed to an aggressive use of force that would risk physical injury.              Not for recidivism.      Not for recidivism purposes.              But are you saying that suppose to Florida split this statute, and some states do, so one crime is a rude touching crime, and the other is the use of physical -- aggressive physical force that endangers the physical safety of another.                  If you have both of those statutes, I take it that you would say either one of them would fit under ACCA as a crime that has the use of physical force, because you are saying the rude touching is physical force?                   Even if you split off the touching from the striking, you would say that the touching falls under ACCA?              And what Congress was trying to get at the worse of the worst in ACCA, the Armed Career, whatever -- that they meant to get after people who go around poking other people in a rude manner?              But there are no provisions that would include domestic violence and the gun possession provision.
08-724 +++$+++               Mr. Benza, do you know of any case where ineffective assistance was found on the basis of a closing argument alone?               General Cordray pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness, and that he did play that theme in the closing. Do you know of any case where the closing, not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel?             You just told me that, under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case in which there has been a decision for the defendant, based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone. So you are asking us to take a new tact and inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.               Why -- why isn't it the Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the context of the case that was presented at trial, and, here, the case was. The only thing going for the defendant were the witnesses to his mental illness and whether, eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury. This is a mentally ill man.             How many -- how many issues were before the Ohio Supreme Court?               So the Ohio Supreme Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at least a per curiam opinion on each of the 67 to insulate itself against being overturned on federal habeas?              Mr. Benza, you might want to use what time is remaining to deal with the other issue, which we haven't talked about at all.               How does that work?   The instruction was all 12 must agree that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators before death is imposed.
08-728 +++$+++                 What was -- what was the second point you just made, Mr. Roberts?                 That, even if the clock is running, you would still have an argument that you come within the 70 days because?              And you would argue it wasn't reserved because both sides thought the period was from September 7th until October 4th, and one thought that that whole period should be excluded?                  That was your position, and then the other side said none of it --
08-7412 +++$+++              Did that --             That's -- that's one of the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the prosecutor had a different judgment of it.               And Florida doesn't have any kind of proportionality review, doesn't have any review -- appellate review of the sentences.             This judge, I think, surprised everyone in the courtroom with the -- with the sentence.   Certainly it was far beyond what the prosecutor recommended.             You have no one?      What was your answer?                Do we know why the co-perpetrators got so -- their sentences were dramatically lower.     Do we know why that was so?            Yes.            Yes.            Because he assisted the prosecutor.            I didn't think he --            For this very offense, this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other than Graham had gotten life without parole.            Did he -- how do you answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a teenager at the point of sentencing?               That it's only after a period of time has gone by, and you see, has this person overcome those youthful disabilities? That's why a proportionality review on the spot doesn't accommodate the -- what is the driving force of the -- your -- the Petitioner's argument is that you can't make a judgment until years later to see how that person has -- has done.            But Florida does -- and every State -- recognize the difference between an adult and a minor.     And you have to make the line.          We have it at 18.   But think of the teenager can't drink, can't drive, can't marry.     There are so many limitations on children just because they are children.            But they don't make it on a case-by-case basis.       They say no juvenile can drink -- no juvenile.             I thought the question is:   Will the difference between life with parole and life without parole deter anybody?               I mean any -- that -- that's what we are talking about.               And I don't think you really were urging that that difference will deter the teenager so he might think, oh, if I commit this violent crime, then I will have life without parole.            I thought that there was a parole system still functioning, so -- although it will be phased out over time, but for people who were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think the suggestion was that that system would take care of the handful of people, not more than that, that this decision would involve.
08-7621 +++$+++             Maybe if you raise the -- raise the lectern a bit -- no, the other way.            I'm sorry, which one?            Can you tell -- tell us something about that catchall that says an illegal sentence can be reopened at any time, illegal sentence?     What -- Mr. Stevenson said that is not limited to just -- the maximum is 15 years and the defendant got 20.            Now, what -- during the -- during the time, the postconviction period, would he -- he had an appointed lawyer at trial.            Then we know that he has a lawyer in 2007.            In between, was counsel available to Sullivan?             No, I mean -- I mean, he does -- he had representation in 2007.              He didn't for his first postconviction motion.              I'm not asking as a matter of right, but did he, in fact, have counsel during this stage, this --            You did say in -- in your brief that if Graham should prevail in his petition, that Sullivan would get the benefit of that decision. How, if we -- if we say -- just say there was an adequate independent State ground and we have no authority to do anything more, how would -- how would Sullivan get the benefit of the --            A new -- a new postconviction motion?              Well, if it's not consistently applied, then it's not an adequate ground. If so -- if the citations are correct and Florida sometimes treats it as rigid and sometimes doesn't, then it's not a consistently applied -- not an adequate State ground.
08-769 +++$+++               Does this -- would this record support any ban?         I mean, there was a real concentration on crush videos.               So there is that.     Is there anything else in the current record other than the crush videos?               I think the government does.   It says that is how you dry up the market.              Is there any indication that there has been any dry-up of the market for dog fights as a result of this statute?              Justice Alito suggested that until the Third Circuit's decision, that there were fewer crush videos produced.              But with respect to dog fights, animal fights, is there any indication that there has been -- there have been fewer animal fights as a result of this statute?              So that goes with snuff movies -- snuff movies.         I don't know if they really exist, but they have been described.
08-810 +++$+++              Mr. Roberts, I thought you said in this -- in this case -- and we're only dealing with this case -- there was the same basic problem, the same flaw in the second interpretation. And you said in both cases, they wouldn't satisfy ERISA's notice requirement.            Is it -- is it -- Mr. Roberts, is it a remedy?             So that s -- one thing is you can view this as the district court as substitute interpreter of the plan, or another way you can look at it is to say, the -- the benefit determination was wrong, we reject it, the court rejects it.   So, now, there is a remedy for that wrongful determination.       So is this, what s going on in the district court, an interpretation of the plan or a remedy for a wrongful determination?
08-861 +++$+++              General Kagan, I thought that -- the Chief asked a question, he posed a sanction, and I thought that any sanction the board wants to impose has to be approved by the SEC?
08-876 +++$+++               How could it have been a term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were massively confused?              Well, there wasn't even a uniform terminology in the lower courts.                   They didn't all use --              Excuse me, may I ask you to put -- in terms of your brief, you said your definition of materiality -- you said materiality is related to but different from what Mr. Estrada is urging the Court to adopt:      economic harm to the victim.       So can you tell us how materiality is related to economic harm to the victim and how it is different from economic harm to the victim?                 Now, kickbacks and -- and bribes is clear.    Sometimes, the government just talks about conflict of interest.             Sometimes, it says, "taking action under conflict of interest."                      Well, action is quite broad. And that's -- what do you include concretely within this self-dealing category?                 Taking or taking action on the basis of undisclosed information?
08-88 +++$+++                 It's an anomaly, though, isn't it, that easily might have matured into ineffective assistance?          It wasn't yet, but if Attorneys 4 and 5, Donaldson and Sleigh -- if the case were for ineffective assistance of counsel, then the defendant would get a new trial, but here the result is he walks.               But knowing that the new lawyer would have to start from scratch, from the beginning, so it was going to take more time.                 If he got a new lawyer, it was going to take more time than if he stayed with the lawyer who was already acquainted with the case but just needed a few more weeks.               Well, wasn't there a concern about this defendant trying avoid a particular judge?    That's why he wanted the continuance?               Not only did the Vermont Supreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the witnesses, it -- it has a record before it.                   I can understand if you're talking about a finding made by the court of first instance, but the Vermont Supreme Court is reviewing a record, it's not making findings.               What about the point that Ms. Rainville made?       And she talked about this balancing that comes out of Barker, and she said you have to weigh against the defendant very heavily, the episodes with lawyer number one and number three, because that was really bad stuff.    The State is perhaps responsible for some of the other delays, but she called those "neutral" in the weighing process.          Don't those two episodes, counsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who says his life was threatened by the defendant, don't those have to count very heavily against the defendant?                Well, the rest, I couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I didn't see anything in her representation that would suggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason to count that in the speedy trial calculus.                  That runs from August 2003 to June 2004.
08-905 +++$+++             But when does the  - when does the 5-year -- what is the trigger for the 5-year period?            Well, what is the violation?            But you -- you say that you did -- you did begin this action even before that point was reached because you -- you attribute this to the disclosure of the internal e-mails in the Wall Street Journal article? So you -- you say, well, we sued even earlier than -- than the point at which we had evidence of scienter.            But Judge Sloviter used the so-called Harvard study, it seems, in her opinion. She thought that that was the point at which you had enough to suspect scienter.            Mr. Frederick, before you -- you've finished, there s something puzzling about the Third Circuit decision, and it's that Judge Sloviter says at the end, in summary, "We conclude that the district court acted prematurely."                 She doesn't seem to close off a statute of limitations defense. It's -- and the same thing on page 48a, footnote 17.     She says, this --          her conclusion is, "At this stage of the evidence" -- she doesn't say that the district court was wrong in saying that the limitation period -- in its judgment about the limitation period having expired.     She just said it was premature. What -- what did she mean by that?            And, Mr. Stewart, the -- you said -- the phrase that you used were  facts constituting the alleged violation,  and the other side says, well, look at the Court's Tellabs opinion:           That described as discrete (1) facts constituting an alleged violation -- which you say is the test -- and (2) facts evidencing scienter.
08-911 +++$+++             But on a motion to reopen, there is -- Seventh Circuit stands alone, doesn't it?            And how many circuits are on the other side?            Was there any -- ever a decision in any of those six circuits that went the way the Seventh Circuit went on the motion to reopen?             Is there any rhyme or reason why some universe of things that could be reviewed in court, Congress put some of the them in the statute and left others out?            Well, it's -- the question isn't whether the Attorney General or the BIA exercises discretion.        In all of these, the Attorney General exercises discretion.             The question is immunity from court review, and ordinarily that's done by statute.     And I do not know of another instance, perhaps you do, where the decision whether a matter that the agency rules on will be exempt from judicial review is made by the agency itself -- the very agency that makes the decision, rather than by the legislature.            And -- and I'm not questioning the discretion.           The Attorney General can be given discretion to rule on the matter, but the question is:     Does that mean that the exercise of discretion will be immune from judicial review? Congress might well say:        Agency, you decide what s within your discretion.        But not say:         And, Agency, we delegate to you, too, the matter whether the court will -- will review your exercise of discretion.            If -- if your interpretation of "under" is right.            Do you have other examples where --  under  is commonly used -- statute and regulations thereunder -- but in the appendix that you have given us, it says, "under regulations." Under  is always coupled with  regulations,  and you want us to transpose that to a statute that conspicuously does not say, "regulations."
08-9156 +++$+++                  I -- I didn't --                 I just want -- I just described the Ninth Circuit decision.                      I didn't say it was wrong.              I don't understand that. I thought that your -- your position in this case or at least one of your positions is there was no unreasonable determination of fact.       Period.              If you're right about that then you win, and there's no reason in the world to go on to (e)(1), that this case in your view should be totally governed by (d)(2), that is, the determinations of fact were reasonable.        End of case.             Somebody said it was put in his mouth, the question was on cross-examination.
08-964 +++$+++             Mr. Stewart, did you -- did the government put forward this machine-or-transformation test?         Was that your test, or was it the Federal Circuit's on its own?            Tell me what your --            You did -- and if you read Judge Mayer's opinion, it has a simplicity to it. It says, if it's technology, then its within the realm of patent, and if it's not technology, it isn't.                If it s based on science or technology -- and that seems to be what is used in other places.            But this case could be decided without making any bold step --            But even the Federal Circuit didn't say it was the test.              It said it is for now.   We know that things that we haven't yet contemplated may be around the corner, and when they happen, we will deal with them.
08-969 +++$+++               Yes, but Congress said -- we were just told by counsel for the Petitioner, Congress said you can only -- only the Federal prosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins --              -- not New York City, not New York State --              -- and it's a misdemeanor.              And now you -- you are saying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after what are basically aiders and abettors of use tax violations?             But do you know -- do we know that?    Do we know whether the Petitioner has in fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?                Do we know -- you gave an instance in your brief or two instances of successful attempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the cigarette buyer.   Did those come about because the city received the Jenkins Act list from the State?                   How did the city get --               Why is what they're doing any different from what out-of-State mail order houses have done in -- they set -- they set up in States without a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a compensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I don't know is ever collected.             Judge Winter in the Second Circuit said the State appears uninterested in enforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or maintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State vendors.   What -- what was the basis for his statement that the State appears uninterested?
08-970 +++$+++             But Mr. Cohen said that that would be a very limited adjustment.             He wasn't contemplating in his suggestion in his brief that you could go outside what the associate would get; you just go to the top.    Let's say it could be 200 to 400, you give him 400, but you don't give him 500. Justice Alito asked -- he was concerned about standard list enhancements, so one question is when do you enhance? Another is, in this case it was 75 percent. How do you know what's the right multiplier? That -- the concern is you are going to have variations from district judge to district judge in how good the performance was, in what is the appropriate multiplier.   Are there any handles that would prevent this from becoming just random, just rudderless?
08-974 +++$+++             Suppose there were no list, but each time there was a hiring round the City just took from the top -- from the top score down. There s no list, but each time the City uses the test results and hires the people with the top scores.            No, my -- my hypothetical was there s no list at all.            They just go back to the raw scores, and each time they picked the top people.               Well, what is -- what is the list, other than an administratively convenient way to use the scores?             So even though there is a clear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the suit is commenced within 30 days of the announcement, then it's as though it were lawful.              That's your position.             Is that -- is that -- there's a free pass.    You don't sue within 30 days of the compilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue 420 days later.   The discriminatory practice gets frozen, the status quo gets frozen forever.              That's -- that is your position, is it not?             But this is not exactly a title -- a statute of limitations.               It's a time you have to file your charge.    It's a charge filing.             There s also a 2-year statute of limitations in Title VII.               You can't get back pay, I think, for more than 2 years.            You -- you don't have one case, I think, certainly not from this Court, of disparate impact.   All the cases that you cite are disparate treatment cases.                And let's add to that, that it was adopted 10 years ago --                -- and Duke Power announced to the world that it was going to use a high school diploma.     Indeed, it listed in the county all of the high school graduates and said:                This is the list.            Can we put that in concrete terms?     It was the 89 percent cutoff, so that anybody who got below 89 percent on the test was never going to be considered until all the first people who got 89 to 98.            You didn't have to take the list down.     You simply could have said:          Anyone who got a passing score, anyone who is qualified -- we re not going to make the distinction between qualified and unqualified.            You didn't have to throw out the list.            You didn't have to throw out the test.              I thought the expert said -- the test devisor said he didn't make up that 89 percent cutoff.     That was Chicago that made that -- that decision.              But you -- you've lost -- you've lost on that.               No, but -- but going to 65, opening up the classification, is not adjusting the scores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying anyone who passes the test can proceed to the next step.             That was a disparate treatment case.             And the -- the argument here is disparate impact is different because there s no need to show intent of disparate impact.
08-992 +++$+++              Well, what's the interest in not applying this in this case?                As you say, that's a fine rule.   If you are a fugitive, you are out.               You say that wasn't the rule at the time he escaped.                But you are not asserting any reliance interest by the escapee, that, gee, if I knew that the rule was going to be mandatory, I wouldn't have a chance to appeal to the discretion, I wouldn't have escaped. There is no -- there is no absence of notice that -- that matters.      I mean, if he had notice he would have still escaped, I assume.              But you just said that it would be okay to have a rule going forward that if you are a fugitive, you are out.                There is a certain irony that the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills, where if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through the whole process before Mills was decided.
08-998 +++$+++               How do you deal with the Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes?                  One is that on the expense side, Congress provided for special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the income side?              What about the argument that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback. She could have waited.
09-10245 +++$+++        I am not following that argument for this reason.     It seems to me if you ask what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the original sentence, well, it has got to be the guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it; then he says I am going to wait for the probation report so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is precisely within the guidelines. So if you asked me to describe what that sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say that was a guideline sentence.     It was right there within the brackets that -- the guidelines.     So why wasn't it a guideline sentence?       I thought one of the things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the judge would have the right to himself calculate the guideline range.
09-1036 +++$+++        It didn't mention -- Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an agency where the district court is -- is sitting, essentially, as an appellate court. But Bowles really was dealing with court-to-court, because it mentioned 2107 and 2101, and I don't recall that it mentioned any -- anything other than court-to-court situations.       Except that -- that one is an adversarial proceeding, the immigration proceeding, and the veterans' is supposed to be claimant-friendly. But I think that the -- the -- just as Bowles is -- is a challenge for Ms. Blatt, so for you is the Social Security context, because it seems to me the quality of review is the same; that is, what the district court does in a Social Security disability case is the same thing that the Veterans Court does in a veteran's disability case.       But it is -- it is an appellate review, isn't it?     I mean, the district court goes on the record before the agency.       What is -       But what happened in this case?     Was there -- was there a registered representative?       You made a point earlier that, well, this is -- the Social Security, there are many resemblances, but one is started by complaint and the other by notice of appeal.     It could be that Congress, having been so kind to veterans, thought:     Why should we burden this pro se, or at least lawyer-less, veteran with writing out a complaint?     The notice of appeal is just a simple one-line document. So could that explain why Congress said you begin with a notice of appeal instead of a formal complaint?       But there's no -- been no determination on the merits whether this claimant should prevail.       That hasn't been aired because the Veterans Court said it had no jurisdiction, and the Federal Circuit said that's right.     So we don't know if this is a good or bad claim.       So Congress couldn't just award money because there has to be an adjudication.       Justice Scalia just asked you:     Could this be -- if Congress decided that this was a harsh result, could it be made retroactive?     But for Congress to say, well, just -- what is it going to rely on to say whether it gives compensation or not?     I mean, the Government's position was he wasn't entitled to compensation for home care, which is what he was seeking.       On the length of time, which is, you said, 120 days -- yes, that's a long time, but isn't it on cert?     It's 90 days plus 60, right?     So it's even more.       But the total number of days would exceed 120, assuming that the application is made -       Application to extend is timely.       That's really the only thing that counsels your result, because in Reed you took -- the Government took the position that a statutory provision is non-jurisdictional if it does not speak in jurisdictional terms and doesn't address the power of the court.     I understand that was the Government's position in Reed. Today you're saying that the only thing that counsels your result is the fact that Congress used the words "notice of appeal."     Is that correct?       Is there any -- any statute on the time to appeal?     Has any statute been held, quote, "jurisdictional" when there is no safety valve of any kind written into it; that is, that -- on 2107, that extensions are possible?     Is -- is there a, quote, "jurisdictional" statute that says 121 days or whatever, and that's it; no extension, no matter what the circumstances are?       Why wouldn't it be a bright, clear line if we said, court to court, Bowles controls; agency to court, Bowles does not control? That would be a clear line.
09-10876 +++$+++        That was the principal thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at all.     You have not said because it was unsworn, because you recognize the certification is the same, but you're trying to equate it to a business record, public record?       You do have the hurdle that this record was created for a specific purpose.     It was created to provide evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.       General, we seem to be describing -- this case seemed rather particular, that is, there was no objection by New Mexico to having an analyst show up, Razatos; so -- so he had to travel however long he said.     It's just a question of one employee's time rather than the other. But -- and then you described how simple this thing was, you just put it in a machine, you would get out a piece of paper.     Why didn't New Mexico have this -- there was an additional sample that could have been -- it would have been si simple to just retest it. Having the witness come to the court, why don't you arm him with the additional test, and then there would be no controversy?       I -- I don't follow that because we have a substitute now.     Caylor is out of the picture; we know that it is the defendant's blood because everything else is the same, and there's this vial that has a certain amount of blood and there's a certain amount left over, so it's not cumulative, because Caylor's out of the picture.     It is the defendant's blood that has been lab tested by another analyst.
09-1088 +++$+++        What about the argument that a good deal of mitigation evidence came out during the trial on the guilt?
09-11121 +++$+++        What do you mean by use it in this situation?     This is a middle -- middle school.     This is an officer who deals only with children.     I can't imagine any setting where age isn't more apparent than when dealing with an assistant principal, a juvenile investigator, going -- deciding - the juvenile investigator deciding the place where he wants to conduct this is in a middle school.     I mean, just as a matter of common sense, how can you say that we're going to have the same test for this 8-year-old as we would for the 30-year-old?       And we look at what is the normal school setting just like we looked at the normal business settings, he's in class, all the children are around him.     This seventh grader was marched by the school security officer, taken away from his peers, from his class in -- put in a room with a closed door with the assistant principal.     That is not a normal part of the school day.     That's not where he is required to be.     This is -       For search purposes, is age consciousness required?     Remember, a part of this is the police officer then goes to the boy's home.     The police officer is trained to deal with juveniles.     And he says to the boy, you can't consent to the search because you're a seventh-grader.     I will have to get a warrant.     So please stay here until I get a warrant. If he can't -- if he's not treated like an adult for purposes of the search, if you get the warrant, if the police need a warrant because they're dealing with a seventh-grader, why should it be different for in custody for Miranda purposes?       I thought all the police officer was looking at when he said "I have to get a warrant" is that he's dealing with a seventh-grader, not all the circumstances.     Very simple:     Age.       He's under the age of consent.       He can't consent to a contract.     He -       Limit it to when the age is known.     If we limit it to, this is an officer who not only knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader but he decides the venue for the questioning is going to be a room in the school, that's -- it's not a mystery.     It's not a guess.     He knows he's dealing with a seventh-grader.     He sets it up. Are we to ignore what the investigating officer knows?     The investigating officer knows he's dealing with a child.       What's the -       Before you -- you are so quick to answer that's right, isn't it so that the manual that this very officer was given to use said before you question a child, give Miranda warnings?       Apparently the people who train these juvenile officers think it's a good thing, not a bad thing to give a Miranda warning.
09-11311 +++$+++  
09-11328 +++$+++        Mr. Dreeben, what about Gant itself?     Gant severely qualified Belton.     Should there have been a suppression remedy for Gant, as Justice Kagan suggested, the very case that changes the law?       And how would you answer it?     Was Gant purely prospective or did Gant itself get the exclusionary rule?       Suppose -- suppose it had been raised?       I don't think that -       Were we right that - there were several cases that were TBR'd in light of Gant.     Maybe some of them shouldn't have been TBR'd under your theory.       She did say that if there is ambiguity, then the police must err on the side of not searching.     Do you think that that's -- do you accept that?
09-115 +++$+++        How do you answer the - the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do business?       Can you explain that, E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the Federal Government has said we want this to be voluntary.     How can Arizona take a Federal resource, which the Federal Government says is voluntary except in certain circumstances, and turn it into something that's mandatory?       I don't -- I don't get into any pre-emption or not, but it's -- Arizona wants to use a Federal resource.     And the Fed makes it available if the employer can use it voluntarily, but not mandatorily.     How can -- how can Arizona set the rules on the use of a Federal resource?       Can you also explain the I-9?     You said it's the same as in the Fed.     Home free if you have documents, Social Security, driver's license.     But you also require the E-Verify.     So how - does the E-Verify information modify the I-9?     How - how do those two -
09-11556 +++$+++        What's the difference between stopping a car and stopping a person on the street, as Justice Sotomayor asked?     You can't stop somebody on the street for no reason.     The person looks to you suspicious, so you stop the person and say:     Tell me your name.     For a Terry stop, you have to have reasonable suspicion.     So why isn't it the same for somebody who is driving a car?       May I ask you something about the practice in New York?     I mean, there is an artificiality to this case because we are assuming that the stop was unlawful.       But the police said it was lawful, because the radio was blasting so loud.     Why did this issue even -- the issue of "suppose it was unlawful" even come up, instead of the city or the county saying what the police stopped him for was a traffic violation, was perfectly legal?     Why get to the constitutional question when the prosecutor brought into play the argument that this was a lawful stop?       You mentioned some - before you finish, you -- you said a name is not suppressible, and that's because this Court held -- we started out by saying the observation of the person that dropped out of this case, so we're talking only about records, but the extraction of a name, you say that's not suppressible, even though it was unlawfully extracted because there were no reasonable suspicions that this person did anything wrong?
09-1156 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick, your time is running out, and there's one thing that you emphasize in your brief -- I haven't heard you say one word about it here -- and that is you're saying it's -- this is not a case of a company that remains silent.     The company, in response to this, issued press releases in which it said any suggestion of a linkage is completely unfounded.     Now, that's something different from there are X number of reports.     To what extent are you relying on the affirmative statements that the company made?
09-1159 +++$+++        The whole thing that was wrong here is that Stanford, instead of drafting the agreement "I agree to assign," should have said "I hereby assign" and then there would be no case.     Is that -- the Cetus agreement said "I hereby assign," and the Federal Circuit said for that reason, even though it was second in time, it takes precedence.     Stanford just said "I will assign." So if Stanford had instead used exactly the formula that Cetus used -- "I agree to assign and hereby do assign" -- would you have any case?       So if the Cetus agreement that came second in time had said "I will assign," then again, you would have no case?       We -- we have a number of sample clauses in this record, and some say "I will assign."     Some say "I hereby do assign."     The notion that the -- that answer, who is it who loses, should turn on whether one drafter says "I agree to assign" and the other says "I hereby assign" does seem very odd.       Then we're talking about nonexistent property; property that may never, in fact, exist?       So in the future, the universities would be protected against a third party simply by changing the form of contract with their employees to say "I hereby assign," so we would have no continuing problem?     Is that all this -       You were here, Mr. Fleming, when I asked Mr. Ayer about that -       That's not -- so that the federally funded project existed at Stanford before Dr. Holodniy ever went to Cetus?
09-1163 +++$+++        Mr. Yang, but the information about location I thought was disclosed, where these explosives were stored.       But we know they're in the building.     We may not know the type of munition.       And I thought that that information was given out for the Bangor facility.       Have you compared the two situations, in Seattle and in -- and in Bangor?     What - because -       Can we go back to the -- I mean, the origin of the Exemption 2?     I thought there was a concern in Congress that, under the APA, section 3 was shielding too much from the public, and so they wanted to have a narrower category.     Listening to you, I really don't see how we have something that's narrower -- narrower than the old section 3 of the APA.     And if you can give me an example, this is what the APA shielded that would not be shielded under section 2, maybe I would -
09-1205 +++$+++        We couldn't know.     We couldn't -- when they went to the West Virginia Supreme Court, that was before this White v. Wyeth.     They were arguing a question of substantive law:     What do we have to show in order to get damages, when we say we weren't hurt by the drug?     We're saying -- we're not saying we didn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't of the quality that it was represented to be. When the Federal judge said, having to make a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the law; you have to show causation, some harm to you.     But then when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West Virginia court, that was still an open question of West Virginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have decided it differently than the Federal court, right?       But sometimes Federal judges -- they try their best, but they're not the last word on what the State law is.       Not these Petitioners. They weren't parties to the case before -       How do you answer that they have claims that do not involve the consumer, whatever it is; that they have fraud claims and some other kind of claims?       Mr. Beck, if you're right about issue preclusion, then if Bayer had gone into the West Virginia court and said, West Virginia court, Judge Davis has decided this case in Minnesota Federal District Court -- issue preclusion -- that's one thing, but what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say: We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to apply issue preclusion.     We're going to stop that court from proceeding altogether. And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to another court:     We're not even going to let you get to this question; we're going to stop you. So maybe you could be right about preclusion but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.       That's true about - that's true about preclusion, but -- and so that you might go into the West Virginia court and say this second plaintiff should be precluded, but as Justice Kagan pointed out, you're dealing with the anti-injunction statute -       -- that talks about judgment.       But that's -- that's often theoretical because on these small claims, it's class action or nothing.     Nobody's going to pay a lawyer to go to court with a $100 case.
09-1227 +++$+++        Mr. MCAllister, have you found any case other than this one where a criminal defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted?
09-1233 +++$+++        Mr. Specter, there - there has been at least two significant changes.     One is the good time credit.     The California legislature did pass the law that upped the good time credits and also addressing the probationers and the parolees -       -- and the technical violators to divert them from the system.     Do you have any information about what effect that legislation that was passed January?       So, do we -- do we know at all what effect it has had?       Is -- is there any other case where the prison reduction has been done under the PLRA, or is this the first -- the first one?
09-1272 +++$+++        Is your test is something novel?     I mean, Justice Breyer mentioned that there are some five tests in the different circuits, and the foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with the tests of any other circuits, or is it different?
09-1273 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick -       -- I thought when this case went back to the -- to the district court, the - the agency's position was this is a total surprise to us, 14,000 suits or whatever it is.     No, we never -- we never envisioned making the individual whatever you call them -- the 430B -       We never envisioned making them the beneficiaries and -- and allowing them to sue.     That would be quite disruptive of our program. That, I thought, was the position the Government took.       I thought it was because the States have been given a role in the statute itself, where the 340B entities have not.     I thought that was the -- the Government's position, that the States have a role in the Medicaid program, and that's an entirely different thing than this program, where these entities have no statutory role, say the drug manufacturers and then HHS.       The result is the same, Mr. Frederick.     And that's -- I mean, it was a central point in this last brief.     You can call it whatever you want.     It's -- Congress has not provided for a private right of action to enforce the terms of the statute. The contract embodies the terms of statute.     So it would be passing strange if Congress, as we now read Congress, said we want private parties out of this; this is to be between the agency and the manufacturer to say.     The same exact result.     The same aim can be achieved through this third-party beneficiary route.     And I think that said, that is the -- I mean, that is what stands out about this case. And so how do you respond to that?     What's the difference between suing because the statute has been violated and suing because the contract has been violated?       But the statute wouldn't apply to someone who doesn't want to be in the program.       But we're told that whatever you say -- that's all we're talking about.     We are told that computing the price is a very intricate business and that many of these disputes have been about what is -- what should the ceiling price be.       There would not -- the ceiling price is out there, and there's no dispute about it.     It's just a question of getting the manufacturers to charge that price and not a higher price.     The question is:     What is the ceiling price?       But that's -- and then they have control over them.     And they don't have control over these suits.       Do you take the position that nothing has changed as a result of the new legislation?     That is, Ms. Anders told us that this statute is going into -- to become effective.     There's going to be procedures, better procedures than there were before.     Is there still this third-party beneficiary suit, despite the possibility of going to the agency?
09-1279 +++$+++        Do you include in this the people, the persons that you say are shielded by this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign governments, State and local governments?     Those have all -- those all fall under the APA definition of person.       Can you give us an idea of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4 for its confidential financial information, trade secrets; and its employees have been protected under Exemption 7. What is it, what would be -- would fall within this privacy exception that would not be confidential business information or relate to employees of the corporation?       But you were about to give a second example of where, even though it hasn't - personal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant things about a regulator.     And what was your other example?       Is that a reason to change what was the understanding of Exemption 7?     One of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the Attorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74 amendments.       I'm talking about the -- Attorney General Levi.       Yes, that's what I meant.       Mr. Klineberg, you have read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight, where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show that, overwhelmingly, "personal" is used to describe an individual, not an artificial being.     And it is the overwhelming use of "personal."
09-1298 +++$+++        So you're -       Am I -- am I right that this contract did specify certain information that the government agreed to give the Petitioner?       Mr. Phillips said the reason they couldn't specify this information is they didn't know what it was.       They -- they didn't know what -- it was secret information.     They didn't know - wouldn't even know what to ask for.       Do you agree that -- do you agree that there is nothing between -- I think Justice Scalia was asking Mr. Phillips, why can't we just say let's -- all bets are off, everybody go home with what they have.     But Mr. Phillips says there are only these two things; there's either default termination or termination for convenience, and nothing in between. Do you agree that that's the world that we're dealing with, those two choices and nothing else?       If that -- if you're right about that, the government's absolute right, could you withhold it from other contracts of these contractors?
09-1343 +++$+++        Mr. Ross -       And it is a jurisdictional rule that civil law systems have always had.       Can we go back to Justice Scalia's question?     I mean, the United States has been telling the rest of the world:     We do recognize and enforce your judgments -       -- if there is a -- a proper jurisdictional basis.       We do, and we would like you to recognize ours.     And we don't get that reciprocity, but we still are trying to get it.       But the United States has taken a very neighborly view about recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments.       Where did the New Jersey company that bought this machine find out about it?       The -- the basis would only be the plaintiff's residence?       But we don't accept that as a sufficient basis.       It's the EEOC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments?     Because that operates only within the Community.       Are there -- there are some cases just beginning -- at the beginning stages, aren't there, involving sales through the Internet?
09-1403 +++$+++        The way the Fifth Circuit wrote the decision, the Fifth Circuit seems to be saying:     Plaintiffs, you didn't show an initially false representation; and you, you plaintiff, didn't show a - a corrective statement that caused a price drop.     As I read the Fifth Circuit's decision, it says:     Plaintiff, you failed to prove one of the two things that you would have to prove. And you say:     No, they really put the burden on -- on defendants, Fifth Circuit put the burden on defendant and found that defendant had met it instead of the other way around?       But your -- your argument seems to say, to -- to get a class certified you have to virtually prove your case on the merits.     You -- you leave almost nothing over.     I mean, if you've won the class action certification on your basis and you've shown the material misleading and the price dropped as a consequence, the efficient market first -- you've shown all that, what else is left on the merits?     You win on the merits if you win certification.       The only requirement we're talking about is (b)(3) because it's -- it's not argued and the district court found that all of the 23(a) requirements were satisfied.     That's not the particular -
09-1454 +++$+++        She's asserting the interests of other children who would be in the situation that she was once in, but no longer; but we have said the plaintiff herself must have a live controversy, and there was no class action here.       Where are you reading in the holding of the court of appeals?     Because I was under the impression that they did say there's only three ways:     One is you get a warrant; another is you get parental consent; and a third is exigent circumstances.     I thought that was the -- the ruling of law by the Ninth Circuit.       Well, let's see where they -- I thought that, yes, the case is about a single plaintiff; it's not a class action.     But they're making a rule of law.     What does the Fourth Amendment require?       You got a stipulation that there was a seizure, so -       There was never any argument that was not at issue in this case.     Given that there was seizure -       -- the question is it reasonable?       Have you, in the -- many of the questions have gone to leads, but this is initially a social worker's investigation.     And you said, when stating what the Ninth Circuit's rule was, that police are in combination with the caseworker. Suppose we took out -- out of the picture. He didn't utter a word in the interview.     Suppose we take the sheriff, deputy sheriff, out.     The only one who comes to the school and asks to talk to this child is the caseworker from the department of health?       If the information elicited from the child is that she has been abused by her father, then there is a likelihood that there will be police interest in that.       It wouldn't affect your client in any way, because she's out of it and you were candid from the beginning to say as far as she's concerned this is a moot case; but as far as Camreta and the other officers are concerned, we were told by Oregon's representative that they are not -- that they have tailored their behavior to conform to this decision.       So -
09-1476 +++$+++        What if added to that is "and I'm going to sue" or "I'm going to file a grievance"?       Mr. Schnapper, you can write a letter to the president, you can write a letter to your congressional representative, but getting to a court, you have to pay a filing fee.     And since this would be a civil case, this Court has held if you haven't got whatever is the filing fee amount, too bad, you don't have access to the Court.       Are you suggesting that in one of these suits you wouldn't have to pay the filing fee?       Mr. Schnapper, this is not -- if you're -- if you're talking about the practical significance, Myers in Connick was going around the office, collecting signatures.     She was taking a poll.     She was taking a poll and the poll was going to be presented to the employer.     That sounds much more petition-like than filing a grievance pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. So the -- the distinction between Connick, who was taking a poll -- why wasn't that a petition? Maybe -- did she just put the wrong label on it?     If she called her case a petition case, it would have been all right?       Mr. Schnapper, let's come to the century in which we are now living.     We have Title VII.     Title VII has this provision, an explicit provision against retaliation.     But suppose it didn't. Suppose it just prohibited discrimination and it didn't have a retaliation clause.     It's the thrust of your arguments that the government employee would have a claim for retaliation, although someone in the private sector would not?       You do, I think, recognize that it would be possible then to circumvent Connick if you could turn around and file a pleading and say:     Now I have a petition, not just a grievance.
09-1498 +++$+++        Why wouldn't Congress think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 45?       Under the 2009 amendment, Rule 45 includes statutes it didn't before and now it does?       I think you would be very happy if we didn't.       But then you would have to -- we would have to wait for another case to decide this issue, one which is a split, that is, the delay resulting from.     What does that mean?       How would you ever know that?     How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher?     A trial judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that there's going to be some motions as you get closer to trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this particular judge took into account the likelihood of motions in setting the trial date or didn't?       Why -- why would the defendant stipulate?       Why would -- why would a defendant who would benefit from the clock running stipulate?       Why do you think that -       -- your motion -- I mean, the government had administrative motions, but you had a Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count, either?
09-150 +++$+++        Well, why not?       Let's go back to this case.       Excited utterance was - the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he - and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened. I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited utterance wouldn't work.     Could he have raised dying declaration?     She said absolutely yes. So my question to you is:     Just assume that we should hold the Confrontation Clause is applicable. Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say, well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying declaration plea here.     So it would only be fair to allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this testimony was a dying declaration?       Then she did argue dying declaration.       And that -- that was in the pre-Davis world.     But do you think the prosecutor had abandoned that effort had he been informed about Davis?       My question was based on it's an open question because we have said maybe a dying declaration.       And it wasn't -- and it wasn't in Giles.     It wasn't in -       Whether we -- whether you agree or not, we said it was an open question.
09-152 +++$+++        Ms. Sullivan -- Ms. Sullivan, if Congress had wanted to do that, they could have said simply that no vaccine manufacturer may be held civilly liable if the vaccine is properly prepared and accompanied by proper directions and adequate warnings.     That would have been the simplest statement. Congress didn't make that statement.     They were asked to amend the statute to make that statement, and they didn't.     I mean, if you wanted to make it clear that there is no design defect liability, then say that: No civil liability unless inadequately -- improperly prepared, improper directions, or warnings. What they -- the language that they used is certainly, to say the least, confusing.     This unavoidable -- these side effects that were unavoidable. Well, why did they need to put that in there if what they were concerned with was to cut out liability for design defects?       The warning -       The warning -- the warning claims, the manufacturing claims, those are always avoidable.       But -- so what can be - the only thing that can be unavoidable is the design defect.       Well, can you -- can we be concrete and concentrate on this Tri-Solgen, which, according to Mr. Frederick -       -- Eli was producing, and it was available for all five inoculations.     And then Wyeth bought it, and then -       If Congress were so clear, as you are describing it, then why didn't it adopt the provision that said failure to develop a safer vaccine would not be grounds for liability?       But it also was directed to vaccines.       The failure to develop a safer vaccine would not be grounds for liability, and Congress didn't enact that.       They set up this whole compensation scheme where everybody agrees -- I mean, the manufacturers got this compensation scheme which took most of the cases out of State court. So to say they were left just like they were before, before they were exposed to all these claims - now it's only to a very small part of them.       Yes, yes.     I got that answer from Mr. Frederick before.     But most of them don't, because it's cheaper, faster, and working well.       Mr. Horwich, would you - would you explain one feature of this, it was the allegation that there were an unusual number of adverse reactions to the particular lot that this child's third vaccine came from, and that those adverse reactions were not disclosed to the doctors.     And the doctors -- the child's doctor said if I had known about the unusual number of adverse reactions, I never would have used this vaccine. Is there any actionable claim for that, for not disclosing that there were a number of adverse -- an unusual number of adverse reactions to this particular lot.
09-1533 +++$+++        What is in (ii) now, on your reading, your expansive definition of "cocaine base"?     What is in Romanette (ii) other than powder?       They're all very exotic, but practically, what does the government prosecute under Romanette (ii)?     What substances other than -       Yes.     That's -- so there seem to have been a lot of words here, but in practice, (ii) is powder and everything else is under (iii)?       Then, Ms. Saharsky, you do get the problem that Justice Breyer was trying to avoid.     That is, on your definition this paste, which is supposed to be less addictive, less addictive than powder, gets bracketed with crack, which is more addictive.
09-158 +++$+++                  And Mr. Fisher uses the word "claim" as -- differently.                 He makes a distinction between "issue" and "claim."              Yes, it's the same issue; could have been -- the issue could have been raised earlier, but, he says, it's not the same claim.                     And the statute uses the word "claim."              I thought your answer to Justice Scalia's point:         Suppose it was raised but the Court didn't decide it.              Your test, I take it, is that he must have one full and fair opportunity to litigate the question; that means to raise it, to have it aired, and to have it decided.
09-223 +++$+++                  Suppose the answer - suppose the answer -              Well, there's another little problem.     Do you know of any case where a benefit that A enjoys is taken away from A in a suit where A is not a party?     I mean, you are fighting the Ohio tax commissioner.     You want to take a benefit away from these LDCs, but they are not in the suit.                    Don't - isn't there a little due process problem with that?              What was that argument? That you're taking a benefit -- you're saying:             The only relief we want is to take this benefit away from people who are not in the lawsuit?               Why should -- why should the Federal court make that choice?                     I mean, in the - in the Federal cases where extension versus invalidation has come up, those were all Federal laws and the court said in the interim, we are going to extend the benefit, we are not going to take away benefits from anyone. Every one of those cases they extended a benefit until -- unless and until Congress acts, but there was some comfort there because they were dealing -- the Federal court is dealing with Federal legislation. It seems to me that -- that there is that choice, the State courts are much better equipped to say what should happen in the interim until the legislature acts.                 The State court could.              But that's because there was only one way to go.          Either the benefit is removed or it's not.     There wasn't the other possibility of decreasing the taxes on your client.                      There wasn't an extension versus invalidation.                It was if the constitutional claim was good, it had to be invalidated, the credit had to be invalidated.              It is not up to you to make that decision, if the State can go either way.                         I mean in the extension versus invalidation cases this Court made it very clear, you could go one way or the other, and that was a decision for the court to make, not the litigant.                But the other view was the Federal court should abstain.                   Abstention doctrines are not the most easy to grant, so -- but they did bring up abstention.
09-291 +++$+++        Can we go back to basics? First, you agree that it is unlawful to retaliate -- to retaliate against a person who filed a complaint, under Title VII, by dismissing a close relative?     It is an unlawful employment practice; is it not?       This is not -- this is not an altogether novel question, because it has come up under some other statutes.     You are suggesting that this is carrying "a person aggrieved" to new heights, but we have both the NLRB and we have OSHA, and both of those agencies have said that to take adverse action against a close relative is an unfair employment practice, and they've done that for some time; have they not?       But it's not -- it's not percent clear he does.     He thought there might be an Article III impediment.     But in -- in your brief, I think you suggested that the EEOC doesn't get a whole lot of deference, and you -- but the other agencies that I mentioned, where there is this claim that can be brought by a close relative, the NLRB gets a lot of deference; the Department of Labor, when we're dealing with Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the mine safety -- those agencies get a fair degree of deference, and they've come to the same conclusion.       But this is a -- an interpretation of the substantive meaning of the statute.       It doesn't have to do with the evidence in a particular hearing.     Can a person who is a close relative sue on the grounds that he was injured, deliberately so, in order to retaliate against his spouse or his fiance?
09-329 +++$+++        Changes the rate in the cardholder's favor?       Yes, but would you - would it be in the greater interest of your client if the initial notice said we're going to raise it to the top, no discretion?       But if it says prefer one notice to two.     So, sorry, we can't give our cardholders that benefit.     We'll say this is the rate, this is going to be it.     Then we will spare ourselves a second notice.       Well, you know the highest rate, because that's stated in the original notice, and you could shop on the basis of that.       And it's fine to say then, Federal Reserve Board, this regulation that you had and that you explained a number of times was a bad one; you should change it, which they did.     But you are up against a regulation that both sides say has some ambiguity, but that the Board has said what it meant a number of times.     So is -- is the Court free to say the new rule is much better so we're going to say that that's what the old rule was as well, in the face of what the Board has said?       But the problem with that is in the Ninth Circuit split about the official statements, and Judge Cudahy gave a very cogent explanation of why the majority just is dead wrong in how it read those official comments.     So you're relying on what two judges have said the official interpretation was, against the dissenting opinion and the Board itself saying that's what we meant in our official comments, in our official comments.       And what about the invited brief in the First Circuit?       So we're getting back to what was my initial question.     So you say you can't have flexibility that would favor the cardholder.     If the initial notice is to count, then it has to be a fixed rate and the company can't exercise discretion to reduce the rate.     That's what you're saying:     A fixed rate would be okay.     The problem with this is the company provided flexibility to reduce the rate in the interest of the cardholder.       I'm not following that argument.     I thought that the new regulation says now any time there is a change in the rate, whether it was announced originally or comes up later, just keeping it nice and simple, a rate change, you send notice.     And you've got -- and you have to do it -- give 45 days' notice.     I thought that that's what the new regulation was.
09-337 +++$+++               Mr. Glazier --               Is there any other than that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing envelopes that she got that say "Costa Cruise" -- is there anything in the entire record other than that definition page that includes carrier, that includes steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a different corporation?                 What is the relationship between those corporations?                 But are they -- are they sister corporations, a parent-sub --                 -- or what?              And if you went to --              If you went to the Web site, which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab that says "Our ships" "Our ships" -- and one of those ships is Costa Magica, whatever.              "Our ships," and it identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator.            That's the information that's given to passengers in the United States who are going to book on these ships.            It says Costa Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator. That's what was being put forth to the public.               So it shouldn't matter that this confusion was caused in large part by this entity that advertises in English under the name "Costa Cruise" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator. "The largest European cruise operator" is how Costa Cruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising.               And the answer is filed conveniently after the 1-year period has run.              Did the answer say the statute -- the 1-year period has run?                     Was that raised as a defense in the answer?               When was it raised as a defense?               But that -- the Rule 4(m) period concerns when you can serve.                      It doesn't say that the statute of limitations is any more than what was the term of the -- of the passage, was 1 year.              Where -- where is the defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed within 1 year of the date of any alleged injury.                     And where is the -- that defense stated?                     You said it comes up 10 weeks --                But we -- let's clarify that point now.    I am looking at 3a, which is the court of appeals opinion, and it says that "Costa Crociere moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after the 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set forth" -- as set forth in the ticket.                    Then the rule tells us that you have this much time to serve, and then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will relate back to the date of the original filing. It doesn't change your statement, your defense.    The 1-year statute of limitations isn't affected.   What is affected is the complaint will relate back if there s an amendment filed.                   But the -year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't bother to answer until the -- that time had run.              Yes, but the relation back is different from the point at which the statute has run.    The statute runs after 1 year.                 Then, if she does what the rules say, it can relate back to the date of the original filing.        The fact remains that you didn't file your answer until after the limitation period had run.
09-338 +++$+++               I thought your -- your position was that everybody agrees on what the law is: If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate.                  So there is no question about that statement of the law. It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up until now we have been talking about this, including Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence.              What does he have to lose at that point?     She has made the ruling and that's that there is going to be a mistrial.                 The lawyer at that point can say:     Your Honor, I object, and moreover, I would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen charge.    Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.              That's a little shaky as precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said:                       The trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new trial.     But in passing, to get there, the Court said: Well, this case didn't involve that.                      But the Court isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in that case didn't violate defendant's right.
09-350 +++$+++        That's not what the Ninth Circuit -- the Ninth Circuit said, we're not deciding the Monell question; we're leaving that -- we're leaving that open.     But Monell -- we're not deciding because Monell doesn't apply to forward relief -- declaratory relief or injunctive relief.     And so the Ninth Circuit has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it applies to all forms of relief. And so that's the question we are confronted with.     Because we have had experience in Monell cases only with damage actions, was -- was the Monell decision wrong in saying that that framework applies to declaratory and injunctive relief as well?       You would have liked the Ninth Circuit to have said there is a policy whatever, because the city is on notice and they've done nothing about it; therefore -       But the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't say that.     It said we're not going to decide Monell liability; we are just going to say Monell doesn't apply.     And if you were just thinking, well, what's at stake?     You say all of our cases involve damages; that's money.     What is involved here? Attorneys' fees; that's money.     So where do we bracket this?     Do we bracket this with the -- with damages, because that's money, and that's what's involved here, attorneys' fees?     Then the only thing that's before us is the award of attorneys' fees, right?
09-367 +++$+++               And if he misses --              Mr. Heytens, one problem with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the defendant misses that deadline, no appeal.                  And we re leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says, within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the restitution. The defendant has to know at that point, must I appeal that first judgment?                   Because if I don't, I'll never be able to appeal it. But on your reading, the defendant can't wait.   When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the sentence.              But that -- that would mean even if the judge says, I m going to impose the restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when restitution is --                 So this then becomes a goal, not a time line -- a deadline?
09-400 +++$+++        What was it -- what was it here?     Because the -- when -- what was his name -- Korenchuk -       -- takes him into Buck's office, and Buck hands him the pink slip and says, "You're fired," that the jury could have credited that evidence.     He was given no opportunity to explain the situation.     What kind of investigation?     What -- she looked at his personnel file.     What else was the investigation?       When?       This is after he got his pink slip.     What -- what point -- when Korenchuk takes him into -- takes Staub into Buck's office, according to his testimony, which the jury could credit, he wasn't asked a thing.     She just said:     Here's your pink slip; you're fired.       After he was fired.       Did -- did I understand you to say that you do agree with the Seventh Circuit's "cat's paw" approach to this?       Can we -- let's look at the statutory factors.       Yes, and where -- where are you reading it from?       But the -       But Mrs. Buck never would have made this decision if Korenchuk hadn't come in and said:     Here's Staub, he's goofing off; he was told to tell me when he was going to be absent, and he didn't. Korenchuk, who has the animus, is a motivating factor certainly in what happened to Mr. Staub, because if you didn't have Mr. Korenchuk marching Staub into Buck's office he would have retained his job. Wasn't his last -- his most recent performance rating very good?       In any case, there was no indication, apart from Korenchuk's coming in, that Buck would have taken any adverse action against Staub.       Well, your position is - and it coincides with the Seventh Circuit, but it is in opposition to the Secretary of Labor's commentary on how this works.     The Secretary of Labor's commentary is it's a motivating factor.     And if Korenchuk precipitates this whole thing, that's a motivating factor. Do we -- I mean, this is -- the Secretary of Labor administers the statute.     Do we give any weight to the government's official position on what a motivating factor means?       Is it -- could a jury find from the testimony before -- before it, that at the time he received his pink slip -- let's not talk about the grievance after -       -- at the time he got the grievance slip, he was not given any opportunity to explain that this charge was not warranted, that he had tried to reach Korenchuk on the phone to tell him: We're going to lunch and was unable to.     He did not have an opportunity to say that to Ms. Buck.
09-448 +++$+++               What about the footnote that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said:                   "Congress found it necessary to explicitly state that the term 'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants to abandon illegal conduct" -- illegal conduct was found here -- "although without a formal court order"?              This is not merely a catalyst.   In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was rejected.   Here the court said:              If I were to decide right now -- the district court said:                   I am inclined to rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an opportunity to respond. So the court had evaluated the evidence at that point as favoring Hardt.             To that extent, it wasn't a purely procedural ruling.            It says:         As things stand now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door open.    So it wasn't just a procedural decision.                  It was an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't it?                Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose the complaint was:      I asked for a turnover of certain documents; they refused without reason. And the court says:   You re right; you re entitled to those documents. It's interlocutory; there is no decision; but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents. The court said:   You are entitled to the documents. And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over because the court has ordered that. Under your theory, because there was no determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to fees.                So that would fall -- even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no -- no award is made?     No benefits are awarded?                But you -- but you say -- you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but that's the only thing that she asked for.                    So she got it. So she qualifies for fees.             Even though you just characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely procedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --                -- so she gets benefits.               Well, I'm not dealing with something obscure.        If the -- the plaintiff says, I have asked for certain documents, they withheld those documents with no good cause at all, and the court said: You re right; turn over documents. It's that hypothetical.                     It's just -- that's the situation.      There is a final order:                 Turn over the documents.   But it's a procedural order, right?               But, nonetheless, benefits would be -- nonetheless, fees would be available?               You re changing -- you re changing the answer.      The answer that you first gave me was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes, qualifies for fees.       Now you re saying no, no fees?              Suppose the claim were They're just not processing my application.                     So, Court, order them to process my application.                     Right; they re not doing anything; we order then to go process the application.    End of case in the district court. Fee entitlement?
09-475 +++$+++               Mr. Robbins, is it -- is it relevant to that, that in the case of other genetically engineered crops -- sugar beets, for example, soybeans -- that the plantings became overwhelmingly the genetically engineered, rather than the organic or natural?              I mean, in response to Justice Scalia's point of how many now, how many at this moment?     But you projected that there would be an enormous increase, and that was not just pulled out of thin air.     I assume it had something to do with what happened to other crops.              Mr. Robbins, but if, as is likely -- I think the government told us that the EIS is about a year away, but that the EIS is going to say deregulate --              -- is going to recommend a deregulation decision.           So we re talking about the -- whatever the farmers of organic or conventional -- they re only a year away from, so they will have to accept that there are other planters who want to do the genetically engineered crop.              But I think you yourself told us how it came out with other crops, that the genetically engineered crop was very popular and took over.
09-479 +++$+++        How do you answer Mr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you can read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule of lenity?
09-497 +++$+++               Why is that -- why is that a big concession, because I thought, as the First Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only claim is unconscionability.            That's a question of fairness.   It doesn't go to the court.               But if they -- if they made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's reading?              Mr. Silverberg, the section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract. But the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who decides that question.              Mr. Silverberg --               Well, this --               This clause is not of that kind, and you ve singled out three things that made it unconscionable.   One, the fee provision, the splitting fees, that the court rejected.               So the only two left is the one-sided aspect of it and the limited discovery. It seemed to me that the limited discovery clause, that that was quite common to say we re not -- we don't want to get involved in the massive discovery you can get in a -- in a civil proceeding.                 Is there something unusual about limiting discovery to documents?

09-5201 +++$+++               Mr. Wall, the -- if we consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at 15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent.                  It's a more workable number, and there are some hints in the legislative history that Congress thought 85 percent, not 87.2 or whatever it is. So in choosing between those two methods, why not take the easier number to work with?                Do you disagree with your colleague that that is the case most of the time, that most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?
09-525 +++$+++        What did -- how did it reserve that?     You said twice in your brief that Janus is a name to which JCM reserves the right.     How did it reserve the right?       In that connection, Mr. Gannon, would you answer the -- the statement that Mr. Perry made that the Government had, in fact, conceded that this theory would spread not only to the -- to the investment adviser so closely linked to funds but to every lawyer, every accountant, every bank.       He said that you said that on page something here.
09-529 +++$+++        It's not a waiver; it's -- the Federal statute is clear.     It says:     State, you can do this in one of two ways.     If you go with a government agency, then that agency has to have independence and it has to be able to sue. So if the State is given a choice, it has - it can do it through private entity; it can do it through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for this very purpose and no other, right?       So the choice is, if it's not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit somewhere.     We know if it were a private entity administering this program, it would be suable in -- in Federal court.     So this State agency is doing the exact same thing, because Virginia chose to do it that way. Where is it -- where -- a very simple thing, the Federal statute says turn over records to the agency, and the State hospital says no, we're not going to turn over the records.     Where does the agency, whether private or public, that's administering the Federal program go to enforce the Federal right?       If you -- is that -- I mean, I want to make sure I understood what your position is on that.     It's not that you go into the court that you ordinarily go to when you want to get documentary discovery; you go to the State's supreme court, and you -- you apply for the extraordinary writ of mandamus?     That's it?       I'm asking you what is the forum?     We have a simple problem.     An agency, whether private or public, wants records.     A Federal statute says you're entitled to the records.     And I would like to know now, Virginia having chosen to give this newly created independent State agency the authority, rather than picking a 501(c)(3) organization to do it -- simple, we want records of these three people, the hospital has them, the hospital doesn't give them to us.     The only way under Virginia law is to petition the highest court of the State for a writ of mandamus?       But which office has said it has to go to -- to the State supreme court on mandamus?     You said that the office has taken that position previously.       Do you know -- do you know of any other statute in which there is an independent State agency that exists for the sole purpose of administering a Federal program?       You couldn't give any example of a Federal program that says:     State, you can do it through a private agency; you can do it through a public agency -- public agency created to implement this Federal program, that is its sole business.     I don't really know of any such.       The bottom line, then, is to -- to restrict Congress's choice.     Congress wants to have an entity superintend this program for disabled people.     So the instruction we would like to give Congress is:     Congress, if you want Federal courts to be able to enforce the Federal right, then you have to set it up as an agency, as a private agency.     You can't give -- Congress, you can't give the States a choice whether they'd rather do it through private or public organizations.
09-530 +++$+++        But isn't that question, that kind of open-ended question, routinely used in employment situations?     That is, the employer wants to know is there any adverse information about this person? Doesn't know which question to ask, because there's a whole -- many things that could be relevant. So are you suggesting that that kind of question is off-limits to the Government, although it is routinely used in other employment sectors?       Well, it has a legend on the top.     Everything that we are asking you is meant to -- to determine suitability for employment.     So they want to find out information relevant to suitability for employment.       -- without --       But you are making a -- you said that these people have worked there for years.     Are they different from the new employee? Are you suggesting it's okay for the new employee, but not okay --       -- for the person who is already in the job?       Are you suggesting that this is no good for Government employment?     You were dealing with a contractor here, but this form, as I understand it, has been used for -- for many years for standard Government employment. Is it -- are they okay?     And for nonsensitive positions, are you -- are you arguing just Government contractor or are you saying even for the Government employee, the person who's hired to work at the snack bar in the Senate, let's say, the Government can't ask these questions?       You are -- you are attacking these forms for all Government employment, not just the contractors?       I'm -- I'm very surprised to hear that.     I thought that -- that it -- there were in -- in the private sector similar questions.       Where does it say you have to turn over your medical records?       Can I ask you to clarify your understanding of what has been enjoined?     We know it's easy for Form 85.     For Form 42, you mentioned the releases.     I thought that the Ninth Circuit's order covers parts of question 7 and perhaps question 8.     I didn't see -- is there something, maybe I missed it, that says they can ask for release of the records?       But they didn't say, Government, you can't ask for the release.       They said you can't ask open-ended questions.       If somebody is going to be enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling if you are enjoined.     Because it has been stayed, you don't have a formal order, but you can't say, well, it's implicit in the, how many page, opinion.       As I understand this process, this is not an oral interview.     It's not -- you fill out a form, you meet somebody, and they ask follow-up questions.     This is -- this handled on the papers, right?       Yes.     But is there -- is there an oral interview in this process?       So then they wouldn't say -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that, and the other thing.     There's this -- it's a written procedure.
09-5327 +++$+++             The State -- the State has no responsibility even though it made this appointment?     So you agree there's no difference, whether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that the defendant picked to represent him, and someone that he just had to take because it's what the State gave him?            Under -- on direct appeal, if counsel conducted himself this way, the State would -- he d have to get relief because the State would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral? Is that what you're saying?
09-559 +++$+++               That's what you ve just said --              -- that they're -- that they are immediately available on the disk, and so while the checking is going on by the Secretary, the public has the list.           Is that what you ve just said?               And that would --               Does -- is it --               Is that because nobody got to count 2?     And the district court -- this whole case in the lower courts was on count 1 alone; wasn't that so?               And count 2 is the one that deals with the harassment.              Is it -- the State has had this procedure now for some time, and there have been controversial ballot initiatives.                    Is there any history in the State of Washington that signers have been subject to harassment?               You did say something about this category of speech.                You said, well, this is in the category that -- it's like O'Brien.                  It has speech elements and non-speech elements.                  And I was trying to figure out which -- what is it in the signature that speaks and what is it in the signature that doesn't speak?
09-571 +++$+++        So we have --       And it's something like I was trying to get at before when I said Miranda is out there, you know what was said, you know what was seized, talking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn't come out with it, high risk it will never come out. So we have use of force, plus -- that can kill people if you're not properly trained.     Brady, because if they don't come up with the information, it could have what almost happened in this case. Anything else on this special list?       The concern was that you don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical law school course before you let them do their job.       But what do you do with the Dubelier testimony?     Didn't he testify that it was standard operating procedure to turn over all lab reports?
09-5801 +++$+++        What well established test?       First, in Fiallo we were dealing not with citizens, this is someone, a resident -- could be a resident alien wanting to bring in a parent or a child.     So it wasn't -- that case wasn't about who was the citizen at birth.       Congress has passed - has passed a statute making certain people citizens and the question is, has it done so in a way that is compatible with equal protection.     But remind me too, because it's not in the front of my head, I thought that classification that was dealt with in Fiallo, wasn't it unwed parentage rather than gender?       Mr. Kneedler, if -- if the classification then were that we want to encourage, because it's good for society, father/child relationships, so we are going to give that advantage, that is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the mothers together with the married couples, would that be compatible with equal protection?       I told you what the rationale was.     The rationale was that we have lots of statutes like the Family Medical and Leave Act that attempt to encourage fathers to have a relationship with their children, to be a legal parent, so that's the rationale of this classification.     They want to encourage the father/child relationship, therefore, they gave this 1 year is enough for the -- for the father. And everything else is the same, except it's the father who gets the 1 year, and the mother who gets the -- what is it, 10 years -       Well, it would you, in fact, acting on the basis of what hasn't been the general pattern but what is becoming the new pattern.       So there is, even though we are still dealing with citizenship, you recognize that there are categorizations that would run afoul of equal protection?       The same as in the Family Medical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave instead as if it had been historically a maternity.       Mr. Kneedler, in answering the question that way, I know you are familiar with the Wiesenfeld, case, and the question was, this was a father who was denied benefits to take care of a -- a child whose mother died at childbirth.     And the Court came out a unanimous judgment but split three ways on why.     And one of the members of the Court said, this is discrimination against the child, even though the classification was -- it's called a mother's benefit - it's discrimination against the child because it should make no difference at all whether the missing parent is female or male, that that was utterly irrational. That was the Chief -- that was then Justice Rehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld.     So he seemed to think that the discrimination was against the child and that that counted for equal protection purposes.       Well, that's what -- Steven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the Court -- at least one justice's rationale was that the discrimination is really against the child, but the father can raise him -       That's a case where mother versus father.     But here it's a single parent. This is not a case where the father is doing something that the mother regards as disadvantageous.     That was in the Lehr case.       And you said something about -- this has nothing to do with stereotypes, this is the way the law was?     But wasn't the law shaped because of the vision of the world of being divided into married couples, where the father is what counted, and unwed mothers, where she was -- they say both father and mother, because the law didn't regard him as having any kind of obligation?       In Nguyen, I thought that this Court relied on the biological factor, which is not so here.     I mean, here there is no question that this is the -- the natural parent of the child.       Mr. Kneedler, in answer to the Chief's question, you know -- I mean, there have been a number of cases raising this extension versus nullification, and in every one of them the Court did make a choice.     It didn't say well, we can't make any choice.     Even in the one, which is Matthews v. Heckler -       -- the Court did make a choice then.     It was the rare case where the Court equalized down.     But I don't know any one of them -
09-587 +++$+++        I thought that the point was that there was no trail from the bed.     I mean, the theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the couch. And I thought that the point that the - that counsel for the State emphasized was, did the -- if someone were moved from the bed, taken to the living room couch, you would have expected to see a trail of blood from the bed.     And there wasn't that.       Mr. Gardner, what about the argument that all this is beside the point because the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?       What do you do with the ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun safe is found there and the unlikely story about them going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and then coming back?       What is your answer to the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins settled that when the California Supreme Court says just denied, it's on the merits?       With this confusion, your version, your colleague's version, when the district court -- the district court denied relief, did you ask the district court, please certify this question of what a silent denial means, certify it to the California Supreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer of what a silent denial means?
09-60 +++$+++             Ms. Saharsky, do we take into account at all -- I mean, in Lopez as I understand it, the petitioner prevailed because it would not have been a felony under the Federal law.              Is that right?            Here we re talking about two crimes.   One is a small amount of marijuana.             He gets 20 days in jail.     The other is a pill that I never heard of, a Xan-something, and then he gets, what, 10 days in jail for that.    If you could just present this scenario to an intelligent person who didn't go to law school, as you're going to not only remove him from this country, but say never, ever darken our doors again because of one marijuana cigarette and one Xan-something pill -- it -- it just seems to me that if there s a way of reading the statute that would not lead to that absurd result, you would want to read the statute. If you are forced to read it because there s no other way -- but maybe there is another way.               I thought if it s in the Federal court, and the -- they are going to use it as a recidivist offense, (a) the defendant is notified of that, and (b) is given an opportunity to say there s something infirm about that first conviction. That's totally absent from this picture. You say, oh, well, that's just a matter of procedure, so he doesn't have to get that anyplace. I think that Congress is requiring that.              It's certainly an element of fundamental due process fairness, notice and opportunity to say, no, the first conviction shouldn't count.            But my point is that if it all happened in the Federal court, if these two possession offenses all happened in the Federal court, at the time of the second one the -- the defendant would have gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it out. I'm not talking about immigration, but just -- and he doesn't have that opportunity the way you treat it.   He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State court because nobody thought that this was a recidivist offense in the State court.            Do we know practically, both on the State side and on the Federal side, do prosecutors presented with a simple possession case, do they -- do we ever see in real life this combination that somebody's going to be convicted as a recidivist when it's one marijuana cigarette on one time and one pill on another? Do prosecutors, Federal or State, do that?            May I ask you --            -- because your time is running out.     I take it your answer would be the same -- at least these two misdemeanors were committed a year apart, but if they were 10 years apart, your answer would still be the same?            There was another crime, I thought a more serious crime, though still a misdemeanor, in this picture, but the Texas prosecutor didn't make anything of that.            Remind me of what that was, but I thought it was a -- a more grave offense.            Yes.            Yes --            So we respect that judgment on the part of the prosecutor, not to make it a -- a ground for a recidivist charge, but we don't respect the prosecutor -- Texas prosecutor saying I'm just going to treat this like it's a first-time misdemeanor; that's it.
09-6338 +++$+++              Does that extend to -- which was part of this case -- the court notices that there was a technical error; it was a calculation error the first time, and the judge says, well, I ll fix that up, too.   That was an arithmetic error.              Have there been other guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so, were those also retroactive?             I think you told me -- I asked you that question, and you told me it could not be corrected, because everything was final.
09-658 +++$+++        On this -       Mr. Wax, just to clear out some of the underbrush, the Ninth Circuit did say that Fulminante was really established law controlling this case.     I take it that you are not defending that?       Did he say that?     Is there a statement in the record that Moore said he would have insisted on going to trial had he been advised that the suppression motion had merit?       I think you -- I think General Kroger brought up that Moore carried the gun. It was cocked, and he shot -- who was it?     Roger.
09-6822 +++$+++        It's true that -- that in all of the briefing in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned by any party.       So it wasn't a question of the Court overlooking it.     The Court didn't say anything one way or the other about it because it wasn't presented as one of the statutes that would have to be overruled.       But doesn't it conflict with 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that a sentence should be sufficient but not greater than necessary to deter criminal conduct?     And the judge is looking at this defendant and says -- a criminal -- to deter criminal conduct and protect public against future crimes:     Well, this person has turned out to be a model citizen, and we don't have to keep him in for a longer time to protect the public against future crimes.     So if I were to apply 3742(g)(2), I would give him a sentence that is unnecessary to protect the public against future crimes.
09-737 +++$+++        But, Mr. Mizer, then you must concede that this opening sentence that Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong.     Courts normally don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an exception.       And, in fact, you did. You did move under 50(a).     This whole case is here because apparently -- well, what reason was it that you didn't make the 50(b) motion?     You told the court under 50(a), after all the evidence was in but before the case went to the jury, that the jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Ms. Ortiz. That was -- that was your motion. You were saying:     Court, there was no legally sufficient evidentiary basis.     Evidentiary basis.     That was the motion that you made, recognizing that the judgment -- the question is whether there is a sufficient evidentiary basis.       Well, then what you're saying is you didn't even -- you didn't need to make the 50(a) motion, that that was just an unnecessary touching base with Rule 50(a)?     Is that what you're saying?       But didn't they -       Then explain to me what -- you made a 50(a) motion.     Why did you -- was there a reason for making the 50(a) motion and not following it up with a 50(b) motion?       It's -- it's very clear from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the explanation, as I indicated when Petitioner's counsel was speaking, is the Re-examination Clause of the Seventh Amendment.     So I think every first year Procedure student learns 50(a), 50(b) go together, and there's a historic reason why you must back up a 50(a) motion with a 50(b) motion.     They're not -- they all - they all ask the same question.     The Rule 56, the Rule 50, 50(b), they all ask:     Is there sufficient evidence to warrant a jury finding, whatever.     They all ask that, but they ask -- ask it on the basis of a different record:     the summary judgment record, the trial record, and the jury verdict.       Do you know of any case holding that you don't have to couple a 50(a) motion with a 50(b) motion depending upon what's in your 50(a) motion?       Well, you -- you refer to Sandin.     There are some extra things about the confinement here.     She was shackled, she was ill, and nobody attended to her.       Well, is -- on the question of whether this treatment was punitive rather than just protective custody.       Well, wouldn't it be this, the segregated confinement in this case, not at large?       Well, then you're - you're saying the category -- the mixed claim -- as Justice Breyer proposed, if it's a purely legal claim, then you're right.     If it's a mixed claim, then you're wrong.       The -- the purpose of 50(b) -- Justice Alito brought out that it's not simply the historical background of the Seventh Amendment, but in that same line of cases, the Court gave a practical reason.     And the practical reason related to the district court, that if the motion is made after the jury comes in, the district judge would have the opportunity to exercise her discretion to grant a new trial. Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright -- where the Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have been a retaliation claim, but the plaintiff didn't make it.     The district judge, given the chance, might have said:     I would exercise my discretion to allow the plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim. I thought it was before -- before the court and it was a good claim.     The Sixth Circuit thought it wasn't. I mean, the purpose is to get the district judge into the picture to exercise the district judge's discretion on the very question.
09-751 +++$+++        Ms. Phelps, there's no question that these signs and the signs like that we saw during the Vietnam War.     But you had the demonstration at the capitol, and you had the demonstration at Annapolis.     This is a case about exploiting a private family's grief, and the question is:     Why should the First Amendment tolerate exploiting this bereaved family when you have so many other forums for getting -- getting across your message, the very same day you did?       But you gave the answer before about -- you said stalking.       Isn't this comparable to stalking?       The Court has made that a very narrow category, hasn't it?     I mean, we have not allowed the fighting words -- you say that to me and I'm immediately going to punch you in the nose, because I have -- it's an instinctive reaction. I think the Court has rejected spreading fighting words beyond that.
09-804 +++$+++        But there's -- I think the brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were more favorable and the summary would show fewer benefits, that the summary would then govern.       So where does the rule come from, then?       Mr. Kneedler -       Do you put -- do you put any weight on Congress insisting that the summary, that each -- each participant get a copy of that summary, but there's no such requirement with respect to the plan?
09-834 +++$+++        But there is a protection built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability only if it's willful.     And on the civil side, the civil liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a violation.       The question is whether the violation is willful.     The willful qualification in the criminal context is are you willfully denying your workers the wages and hours the statute requires?       Nothing to do with retaliation.       Do you know, how common is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section of the Fair Labor Standards Act?       I thought that the whole idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I would like you to address particularly the amici's point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language, for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have meant that all complaints are okay?       How does it work with respect to the more recent statutes?     Title VII, The Age Discrimination Act, Disabilities Act?       Yes.     If you have not filed anything with the Government, but you have to your supervisor opposed a practice.       But is it -- so in those cases I think you are quite right, intracorporate complaints count as opposing any practice.     Has there been any huge problems about people saying, oh, I made an oral complaint to my supervisor, and supervisor said I never heard of it?       That isn't even brought up in the brief in opposition, right?     It -- it's in your brief on the merits.       How would it -- how would it relate to, say, an equal pay complaint?     Because equal pay is formally part of the Fair -       -- Labor Standards Act. But an equal pay complaint could also be brought as a Title VII suit.       So a -- a worker just complains about the denial of equal pay to the supervisor.     Does that -- is that -       And there's been -- you said there was no evidence of the government for 60 years -- but there has been some 30 years or more experience under Title VII of the statutes, with oral complaints to the employer as being sufficient to ground a retaliation claim.       But it really -- it starts in 1970.       It starts in the 1970s.       Just one more question.       It seems to me you are saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the Government. Isn't -- in the work setting that's being regulated, wouldn't there be every reason to want the employee to complain first to the employer rather than making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a Government agency?
09-837 +++$+++        Because they don't work at schools.       But it certainly can if they're a -- if they can be a student in the last year of medical school, and they -- they're doing subintern-level work.     That's a clinical program where they would be categorized as students.       Mr. Roberts, do you know the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is: Are all hospitals with resident programs schools?       Mr. Roberts, the Petitioners' brief says twice that there's some question.     Assuming that we hold that the -- the residents are subject to the FICA tax, there's some question whether, even if they had to pay the tax, whether they would be eligible to receive Social Security benefits or, I take it, credit for four quarters in full.
09-846 +++$+++        The government says the statute is simple.     It says you can't have two suits simultaneously, or you can't when the CFC suit is the - the second one. And Mr. Yang told me that yes, the government thinks that in the Casman case there was a choice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district court, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but you cannot get both.     And when Congress realized that that's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a two -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution. Congress said, there will be one lawsuit.     It will all be in the claims court, and they can grant both the back pay and the reinstatement. So the two-suit approach was rejected, I guess, in -- in Congress's response to Casman.       That would be inconsistent with the definition of "claim" in the federal rules, I think.
09-868 +++$+++        You can challenge only the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review?       Do -       Do you agree that Rule 35 is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before seeking Federal habeas?       But this is the whole purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal statute, the purpose to give the petitioner an opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?       If you look at 2255 - that's the Federal postconviction review, and it also has a 1-year statute of limitations.     That limitation would not be tolled for a Federal Rule 35 motion.     So why should it be tolled for State?       You think it doesn't matter that -- I mean, a Rule 35 motion is a motion made in the original criminal proceeding, not to the side of it.     So isn't a collateral attack a sort of -- another proceeding to the side of the main proceeding, but the Rule 35 motion is filed in the criminal proceeding itself?
09-893 +++$+++        Mr. Gupta, is -- I'd like you to focus on Stolt-Nielsen.     In Stolt-Nielsen this Court said that, absent express consent, no class arbitration.     If the seller or employer, whoever it is, doesn't want that class arbitration, doesn't have to have it. And here that's surely the case; the ATT has not consented to class arbitration.     Then California law says:     Well, that's okay; then you will be subject to a class-action suit in court.     But the very purpose of the arbitration agreement was that you would be in arbitration and not in court.     So why isn't Stolt-Nielsen dispositive of this case?       But here you have an unwilling defendant who doesn't want class arbitration.
09-9000 +++$+++        Then you are -- you are asking for a modification of the Wilkinson-Dotson formula, because the formula is, I think, quite clear. It says:     "Would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction or the sentence."     Wouldn't necessarily demonstrate, and the Petitioner is telling us, it may not demonstrate it at all.     It may demonstrate that my client was, in fact, guilty.     So it wouldn't necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction. And I think to get -- to get -- to say that you should prevail, you would have to say:     Court, you were wrong in using that formula, because here we have a petitioner who says, I'm not claiming that what I'm seeking would demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction.       So you are asking for something in addition.     You say:     Court, don't just look at the words in Wilkinson v. Dotson.     This is a different case, as I suggested originally.     This does not involve parole.     The ultimate destination in this case is the conviction and sentence.       So, then, can you give us your best modified statement of Wilkinson against Dotson?     I think you were telling us that that formula fit that type of case, would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction. It's given here that this evidence would not necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of the conviction; nonetheless, you say it falls on the habeas side of the line.     That does require you to ask for a modification of the Wilkinson v. Dotson formula, and I ask -- if you could say what that would be, what that precise modification would be?
09-907 +++$+++        I thought the -- the general position was you get either the actual payment or the 471, of whichever is higher.
09-958 +++$+++        But you're saying then, if Congress loud and clear says, we want HHS to be the sole enforcer of this law, you're saying--       Of this, yes.     You're saying that that would be ineffective because there could still be a Supremacy Clause claim.       That's on the merits --       -- but Congress says, we don't want anybody coming into the court.     We want --       Then it's a question of what will be the default rule.     Congress is silent.       Is the default rule that there is a Supremacy Clause action or that Congress must expressly allow it?       You said you would be satisfied with a limitation that the Court can issue an injunction pending the administrative procedure without going on to then the substance of the question, was there compliance with 30(A) by California?
09-987 +++$+++        Mr. Bender, can I go back to your point -- you were making a distinction between the taxpayer who makes a charitable donation.     Well, that taxpayer has the whole universe to spend it on: Buying clothes, on gambling, on this charity, that charity.     But your point here is this contributor does not have the universe to pick and is free to pick a charity.     This one has -- you either give it to the government or you give it to the STO.     That's -
09-993 +++$+++ 
09-996 +++$+++        Well, your -       And suppose -- suppose California had a rule that said that you have to file within 1 year of the finality of the conviction, absent good cause for the delay.     If that were the rule that California had, your client certainly would be untimely and you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, right?       Would -       But if there is a requirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances permit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as prompt as circumstances permitted?       But didn't this come about because it was returned?     This was not -- I'm thinking about -- he didn't -- he didn't make any claim that he was -- he was diligent.       He didn't make any claim that he was diligent in filing it 5 years late.       Well, why can't you take the brackets of -- what was it, 5 months is reasonable time; 18 months is not a reasonable time?     Mr. Martin falls outside of the 18 months.       I thought there was a decision that said 18 months is too long.       There was a decision that said 18 months is too long.
10-10 +++$+++        The South Carolina Supreme Court, as I understand, heard this case after he was released, so they didn't consider it moot.       But it was a fact, was it not, that he was already released?       Isn't it -- isn't it true that most States in child support cases, when the defendant says I have no money, will appoint counsel?       I thought the point was it's -- it's only if the defendant -- the claim is only if the defendant does not have the keys in his pocket because he has no money.     So, in cases where typical a recalcitrant spouse won't pay until he's threatened with jail, that wouldn't come in this category.     I thought Mr. Waxman was speaking about people who do not have the keys in their pockets because they simply cannot -- they do not have the wherewithal to pay.       What about you -- you stressed that this falls on the civil side.     So, why shouldn't we take Rule 54(d) as our model and say that instructs the court that you give parties the relief to which they are entitled, even if they haven't asked for that relief, even if they've asked for something that they can't get?       Do we have any -- any computation about what it would be -- what the counsel fee would be, as opposed to keeping someone in prison for a year?
10-1001 +++$+++        And how much time.       How much time -- in the procedure you described, appointed counsel does inform Martinez:     I'm not bringing up any -- any claims for you.     So, if you want to pursue relief, you have to do so on your own. How much time would the defendant have?     How much time remained?       Would you explain to me, why don't we consider this adverse to your proceeding, because this postconviction proceeding -- it began and it began at the same time as the direct appeal, but it ended before this case became final. So, it was the first -- it was the first tier because it was decided before the direct appeal.
10-1016 +++$+++        Need go no further?     I'm sorry.     I -- I didn't --       They couldn't -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat pregnancy like any other disability.     So, if they're not giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day.     And that's what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills.     It says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then you have to give that to men as well.     You can't reserve that for the one sex.     So, it was the gap in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was referring to.       The idea is it's part of one package.     I think that's what Justice Breyer was getting at.     But just suppose that Congress wanted to improve conditions for the -- in the job market for women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect families so that sick children, sick spouses are attended to. Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker herself is sick?     Without -- it's all part of one package which is designed to increase job security for women and increase protection for their families.     So, I don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three.       Was that -- that wasn't part of the original Act, was it?       And so, it was -- that was -- the concern was a discrete concern for veterans.       In that part.       It wasn't part of the package that was the Family/Medical Leave Act.       But there's some focus in the legislative history particularly on the -- the family that has a single parent -- much more often a woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner getting sick.     So, that was certainly an -- a problem for families with -- with only one breadwinner.     And Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have job security for them.     That wasn't the only group of women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this Act as it came out, didn't it?       There's a question of how Congress would do it.     If they -- if they provided only for the woman who's the single head of the family, then that would be vulnerable under equal protection because they didn't provide it for men.       So, the leave is a remedy for the problem.     I think there's really not much disagreement about the problem, that there is gender discrimination in the job market.       And then the question is how do we remedy that?
10-1018 +++$+++        Why didn't you cross-appeal on the clearly established law?     Because then -- then you could concede, so, arguendo, he had qualified immunity, but the advice that he gave was contrary to clearly established law.       Why didn't you bring up that -- that issue?       No, but -- but whether it was clearly established.     In other words, what we had here was a recognition:     We can't go into the house; we can't go into a house, private house, without a warrant. So -- in fact, Filarsky said something about I know a way -- a way to get around that; we just tell them to bring out the items.       What about -- what about the argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to be a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses would be the government employees?     They would be the battalion chiefs, the fire chief.     So, one of the reasons for the qualified immunity is you don't want to disturb government employees in the routine performance of their work.     Certainly, in this case, there would be disruption, distraction of these government employees.
10-1024 +++$+++ 
10-1042 +++$+++        Then why is the statute labeled, titled, "Prohibition Against Kickbacks" -- that's one thing -- "and Unearned Fees"?     What -- how do you -- what does "unearned fees" refer to in the title of 2607?       Did you give a complete answer to the question what does (b) cover that (a) does not?     So, one suggestion that's made is, well, you didn't -- if all this statute has to do -- do with is kickbacks, then all you need is (a), and there's no necessity for (b).     You said one thing is contract, proving a contract, and not -- is there anything else?
10-1062 +++$+++        But they asked -- they asked for a hearing.     Didn't they ask EPA for a hearing on whether their lands fell within the statute?     They did ask for a hearing, and the EPA said no.       There's -- there's one thing I do want you to tell us is -- EPA has three choices.     It can go to a compliance order; it can issue an administrative -- trigger an administrative penalty when -- where there would be APA review; or it can bring an enforcement action.     How does the agency decide which of those three routes it's going to take in a given case?       But what about this administrative order that -- the administrative order internally within EPA subject to judicial review?     When does it use that as opposed to a compliance order?       But in concrete, Mr. Stewart --       -- how would it work? You say it's a lesser standard under the APA.     But the question is, is this wetlands or is it not?       But as far -- as far as the EPA is concerned, they're finished with that question.     This is not something that, well, we might look at it again tomorrow based on new evidence.     The determination that these are qualifying wetlands -- that has been made.
10-1104 +++$+++        Would you be taking the position that even if there is an alternative State remedy, tort remedy, even so there ought to be a parallel Bivens action?     Or would you say no Bivens action if all of the States have adequate tort remedies?       But in Carlson, it was Bivens or no damage remedy.     Here, that's not the case.       In Carlson, the Court was operating on the theory that with respect to the Federal employee, it was a Bivens remedy for damages or no remedy at all.       Right.       And here, it is different from Carlson because there is an -- a remedy against an individual.     So, we have the parallel remedies here which didn't exist in Carlson, and that makes the two cases different.       Well, what was the purpose of making the reference to private contractors in the Westfall Act?
10-1121 +++$+++ 
10-114 +++$+++        I don't see how that - one can say that looking at the complaint.     It said extortion, emotional distress -- where is the complaint? Let's look at it.       Right to be free from extortion.       Is -       I thought that the Louisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the basis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal theories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant removed this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted to keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the Louisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly appropriate. The -- the claim alleged gave rise to extortion claim, the defamation claim; so this complaint was filed in Louisiana court that has a rule that says tell us what happened, and then you can have whatever legal theory you're entitled to.       Isn't that implausible, Mr. Stancil, when we consider that of all the claims here, the one that would seem easiest to prove is extortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a criminal proceeding?     So if you're looking look and you say what is the outstanding claim here, I would assume that it was the extortion.       The district court was prompted to do that by your motion for summary judgment.       And you could have brought that motion very early on.     If this is a frivolous claim on its face, then why didn't you move to have it dismissed immediately?       Mr. Stancil, the first magistrate to get this case said explicitly that the discovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court, would be usable in State court proceedings where those materials might aid in obtaining a judgment.     So doesn't that have to be taken into account, that the discovery materials developed in Federal Court will now be used in the State court proceeding?       Well, that certainly conflicts with the first magistrate.     The first magistrate said use the material in the State for the State court proceeding.       That's disembodying what -- we have a factual scenario here.     Some of the discovery was spent in determining what happened with the alleged racial slur.     Investigating the facts of that claim are certainly relevant to the State court proceeding.
10-1150 +++$+++       Mr. Shapiro just told us, 6     when I asked him that question based on your -- your 7     brief, that people need to know up front that it's -- 8     this is not a patentable subject matter; very important 9     that it be 101 and not 102 and 103.    So, how do you 10     answer his rejection of the adequacy of prior -- 11     anticipating prior art or obviousness?
10-1195 +++$+++       Mr. Garre, do you have 18     any example, other than this statute which is odd -- is 19     there any other example of a claim that arises under 20     Federal law, as this does under Federal statute -- the 21     substantive law is Federal -- that one may not bring in 22     State court?      Is the law any different, 24     the violation and the governing law, any different than 25     if the Attorney General had brought suit or if the FCC      But I'm talking about the 10     claim of the -- the violation, the wrongful conduct is 11     the same whether the Attorney General is suing, whether 12     the FCC is enforcing.      Mr. Garre, was it really 25     a loophole?    What would -- I mean, if this -- if conduct -- if the telemarketers are calling from out of State, 2     but the impact is in the State, the person who is being 3     called, it seems to me that there certainly would be 4     jurisdiction over the out-of-State tortfeasor who's 5     doing something out of State that has this impact.    It 6     targets the State, and it has its impact.      How about supplemental 7     jurisdiction?    Which says it doesn't have an amount in 8     controversy.      But Congress -- Congress also -- it made -- for attorney general suits, it said: 2     And Federal court jurisdiction is exclusive.    So, it's 3     given Federal court exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate 4     this claim, because the claim, as you -- I think as you 5     recognize, is the same whether it's brought by the FCC, 6     the attorney general, or private.    So, if you use the 7     word "exclusive" there, it said nothing in this private 8     right of action about the State courts being exclusive. 9                 MR. GARRE:    And I think on that -- I mean, 10     first, it makes sense that they would authorize Federal 11     jurisdiction for the State attorney generals' actions 12     because they authorized the FCC to intervene there.    It 13     also makes sense that they said "exclusive" there because there they were dealing with the constitutional 15     presumption that State courts have concurrent jurisdiction unless Congress affirmatively says they 17     don't.    This Court had decided Tafflin a year earlier. 18     And so, it -- to give Congress its due, it would make 19     sense if you presume they're aware of this Court's 20     decisions, that it would say "exclusive" there.    The 21     constitutional --      Let's go back to the -- 22     this -- this claim -- unlike the Shoshone Mining, this 23     claim arises under Federal law.    There's no question 24     about that, is there?      Okay.    So, Federal law 3     creates the cause of action, and when Federal law 4     creates the cause of action, the rule has always been 5     there's 1331 jurisdiction.      But the later-enacted 10     statute doesn't say that Federal law no longer creates 11     the cause of action.      You have jurisdiction 17     when Federal law creates a cause of action.      When Congress creates a 8     Federal claim, it usually doesn't.    I mean, the 9     assumption is that it's going to be concurrent jurisdiction.      Can we go back to your 17     1983 example?    Because I was thinking about that, and 18     you said, well, the later specific statute is another 19     Federal statute.    You have -- Congress has another 20     Federal statute that makes the more general 1983 not 21     available because you have the more specific Federal 22     statute.
10-1211 +++$+++        But it wasn't before. We -- I think we have held that an immigration lawyer is obliged to tell a defendant faced with a criminal charge what the legal -- what the immigration consequences will be.     And here, suppose before the -- at the time of the plea in this case, the attorney had said, once you've served your time, you will be able to take brief casual trips.     That would have been accurate advice, right? Before IIRIRA.       But I'm asking you, the lawyer talking to the client -- and the client wants to know before I enter this plea, what will be the consequence for me?     And the question that's asked is, will I still be able to visit my mother in Greece?     What should the lawyer -- what should the lawyer at that time have answered?       What about the characterization?     Which seemed to me to make common sense.     Yes, the trigger is that he has gone abroad and is returning.     But the target, they say, was the crime. That's why the law -- the law really doesn't care about the travel back and forth; what it cares about is that this person was convicted of a crime.
10-1219 +++$+++        Are there limits on the new evidence that can be produced?     Are there any limits, in your view?       And on that I think you -- you're not taking the position that Judge Newman did. I think -- didn't you say that if no new evidence is introduced in a 145 proceeding, then the court engages in APA-style review?       And that -- and that --
10-1259 +++$+++        But he -- he wouldn't be protected against a surveillance camera that could get information.     And is this really different in kind from the surveillance camera?       I think that's conceded by both sides, and that's accepted by both sides.     The warrant expired.     There was no warrant.     The government certainly could have gone back and said, judge, we didn't make it; we need a little more time; give us 10 more days.
10-1261 +++$+++       If you extinguish the 8     claim -- the statute of limitations doesn't terminate 9     the claim.    It just says you can't get a remedy if you 10     sue too late.    But there are statutes that say you have 11     no claim after X time, and that would certainly be a 12     repose.    You have no right anymore after that.
10-1265 +++$+++       I thought -- Mr. 6     Waxman --      I thought -- I mean, this 11     is a case that has been going on for, what, 12 years in 12     the district court?      And I thought that the 15     basic disagreement between the client and counsel was 16     counsel said our best shot is going to be to keep you 17     alive; so, we want to do everything we can to change the 18     death sentence, and then -- and we don't want to detract 19     from that by making a claim of actual innocence when 20     there's -- there'd be a very slim basis for that.    So, 21     that's the judgment, and it's a strategic judgment that 22     counsel made
10-1293 +++$+++ 
10-1320 +++$+++        General MCDaniel, in this case, they deliberated for 4-1/2 hours at the point where the judge asked them where do you stand on this count; where do you stand on that?     And so, they were up to the manslaughter, and they were stuck on that.     And the jury foreman said we can't go to negligent homicide because we haven't reached agreement on -- on the manslaughter charge.     Then they go back for just a half hour. How realistic is it to think that they began over at that point, rather than trying to resolve the manslaughter charge so they could do exactly what the judge told them, and then get to the negligent homicide charge?       Mr. Sloan told us that it was the State that prevented the elucidation because defense counsel said:     Judge, we can try to do what Double Jeopardy Clause says, not try a person twice for the same offense.     So, Judge, please ask the jury to rule on those two -- give them a sheet that gives them a choice of guilty or not guilty. But they went -- that originally was just a series of guilty on the four counts, and then their other choice was acquittal. Now, defense counsel says, ask them, is it guilty or not guilty, instead of asking just is it guilty.     And the judge declines to do that.     Isn't that why we don't have definitive answers?     Because defense counsel says -- said, Judge, give the jury the chance to tell us whether they --       Well -- she had asked; so, why was it necessary for her to repeat it?     And she said, Judge, please let them vote yes or no on the -- the two most serious charges.     And the judge said no. She might have figured if she was going to repeat that, she would just annoy the judge.     She had made the -- she had made the request.
10-1399 +++$+++        But your reading doesn't encourage employers to pay, because they can stop just by saying they contest, right?       So -- so, your reading I think leads to protraction.     And they get that date of injury rule no matter how long they string it out under your reading.     If you read -- what is the magic phrase -- newly --       You can say, well, that means in the case of the employer who pays promptly, pays immediately and continues to pay voluntarily, that the compensation is acquired when the employer starts paying voluntarily.     But if the employer is not paying, then the compensation is newly awarded when there's an award. So, I don't see why -- what kind of problems this statute would have if we say newly awarded could mean awarded by the statute, which would be newly awarded when you're injured; but it can also mean compensation ordered by an award.     So, you have the employer who pays promptly can lock in that early date, but if he doesn't pay promptly, the -- then the ceiling is going to go up till the time the award is entered. What's wrong with that reading?       And your answer to the -- to the problem of an employer protracting -- so he doesn't have to pay sooner; he can wait till later -- is there would be no penalty as long as the employer says I'm -- I'm contesting, but you say the attorney's fees, that's -- is that --       About what percentage of the compensation cases involve the statutory maximum? Because if you -- if your pay is less than the statutory maximum, this issue doesn't come up.
10-1472 +++$+++        Mr. Himmelfarb, in section 1920, there are two provisions that specify costs necessarily obtained for use in the case.     And the interpreter provision doesn't have that qualification, doesn't say "necessarily obtained for use in the case."       You are asking to read "interpreter" to mean "translator" as well and to import into sub (6) "necessary for use in the case."
10-1491 +++$+++        But this statute doesn't use the word "individual," and it doesn't use the word "person."     As far as a corporate entity is concerned, a corporate -- a corporation could sue, could be a plaintiff under the Alien Tort Statute, could it not? There's no --       What happened to I.G. Farben?     I thought that it was dissolved and its assets taken.       But there's no -- there was no civil liability adjudicated in Nuremberg.     It was about criminal.       If you look --       If you look to the law of the place where the corporation is headquartered, well, suppose that has a typical respondeat superior liability that says corporations are liable for the acts of their agents.     So -- and most -- correct me if I'm wrong, I think most countries in the world have such a notion, that corporate -- corporations are responsible for the acts of their agents.     So, how does the -- looking to the law where the corporation is headquartered, where does that get you when that country has the very same law that we do, that, yes, corporations are liable for the acts of their agents?       Ms. Sullivan, and I'm -- in Sosa, as I understand it, it's all about what is the conduct that falls under this law of nations.     It is not about who is the actor subject to that law.     Sosa is dealing with what kinds of conduct come within the Alien Tort Statute.     It -- it doesn't consider the question of what actor; that wasn't before the Court.     What was before the Court is what kind of activity violates, is contrary to, the law of nations.       I assume the United States has taken that into account.     I mean, for you to -- representing the corporations to say what is in the interests of the United States, when the United States representative told us they think that individuals and corporations are both subject to suit.       I thought they rejected civil liability for everyone.     It wasn't limited to corporations.
10-1542 +++$+++        In your -- your argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a cancellation of removal based on the parents' status.       There -- this Court has dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child relationships under the immigration law.     And let's take Fiallo v. Bell.     There the Court said, well, it tells us that for married parents it's this way, and for a child born out of wedlock, that relationship is something else.     That could be considered quite arbitrary when the question is, is the child left orphaned?     But the Court said, well, that's what the statute said.     It made that distinction, and the Court upheld it. But there are a number of cases where there is -- the statute does say, parent-child relationship, this is imputed, that is not, and dealt -- the Court dealt with that in Miller and Nguyen.       What do you do -- what you do if the parents -- the father is an LPR, the mother is not?     Do we then impute to the child the father's status?     The couple is not married.       They have joint custody. They live together.     They're just not married.       Well, I think it was agreed that -- that LPR status would be necessary.     At least, Mr. Kinnaird said that.       So, we're talking about the 5-year period and the 7-year period.     The child would have to have LPR status.       But you can be a resident without being a domiciliary?
10-174 +++$+++        General Underwood, the - the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing that EPA does.     I mean, Congress set up the EPA to promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise, as a kind of super EPA.       But if we just concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say: District court, if we pass everything else, you set emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set a cap, and then annually you require further reductions. Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it sets emission standards.       The agency -- the agency is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another facet of this case, the potential for conflict.     The EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and it has taken the first steps. One argument that the EPA -- that the United States is presenting is the way agencies go about this is incrementally, so they're starting with motor vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and then they'll get to maybe where you are.     But you want the Court to start with the existing sources, to set limits that may be in conflict with what an existing agency is doing. Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there and that it is regulating in this area?       Your point is that EPA, unless and until EPA gets to the point of setting standards for existing sources, the court can be side by side with the agency; we know that the agency is beginning, it starts with light motor vehicles, and then it's moving forward.     But you say as long as the EPA hasn't gotten to stationary sources, the court can be conducting a similar function with -- one of many differences is that if the EPA is setting the standards they will set -- they will do it through notice and comment, everybody will be able to put in a submission; but the court substituting for the EPA, how does the court replicate that notice and comment process?       But now there is an agency, and we know that it operates in a certain way, through notice and comment rulemaking.       And here is the court and how does it operate to get to those standards?       One aspect of the litigation process as opposed to the agency process, the agency makes its rule and that can be challenged in court, but suppose your plaintiffs lost this case on merits.     I take it this is not a class action, there's no certification of any class.     Other plaintiffs before another district court could launch a similar action against these very same defendants, right?     There would be nothing to preclude that?       That means you have -
10-179 +++$+++        Mr. Englert, something you just said about if he had any opportunity -- I thought his position was this is a nondischargeable debt.     Even if it's discharged in bankruptcy, this debt would survive.       So it wouldn't be wiped out?     I mean, it would -       He would have another forum.       Just one more point about the nondischargeability.     He didn't have to bring that claim, did he?     I mean, if it's -- if it's a nondischargeable debt, he doesn't have to have the bankruptcy judge confirm that it's a nondischargeability debt.       Because there was no bankruptcy court handle to start with.     There was no claim.     If you're going to go back to equity, equity lays hold of a claim that fits within the equity court, and then, as you know, there were clean-up and clear-up doctrines so they could decide the whole case. So I think that the one thing one can say about Marathon is that when the debtor has a claim against the creditor and the creditor hasn't made any claim in the bankruptcy, he can't drag that into bankruptcy court.     But once the bankruptcy court has authority over the claim, the creditor's claim against the debtor, then the court can clear up the whole matter.       Just clarify one point, Mr. Englert.     As I understand it, before the code was amended, when the Federal courts were operating under the interim rule, it was standard that the bankruptcy judges, given a claim against the estate, routinely dealt with counterclaims.     Isn't that what the practice was when the interim rule was in effect?
10-188 +++$+++        Which is -- can you point us to the page so we can see the Second Circuit's definition of report and the Second Circuit's definition of an FCA investigation?       Well, I don't -- I don't want to eat into your time.       Did the FCA, the amendments in 2009, which are not retroactive, do they have any bearing on this problem prospectively?
10-209 +++$+++        I think that's not -- that he got ineffective assistance, yes, that's not controverted.     But that he would have gotten the 51 months or 68 is certainly controverted because of two interventions.     The prosecutor can say:     No deal; I'm withdrawing it, even after an initial acceptance.     And the judge can say:     I think 51 to 68 is entirely improper for what this man did.       How can the judge -- the judge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the sentencing range is 81 to 135.     So, without any -- considering anything that happened at trial, the judge knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man had been charged with -- only with a felon in possession.       So, it -- it seems most unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea bargain for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.       That may be, but is it not true that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon in possession?       What is the unanimity on the remedy?     Here, the court said that the writ shall be granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer the 51-to-85-month plea.     So, that doesn't bind the judge, but it does bind the prosecutor.       And it removes the possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have withdrawn that initial offer.       So, the prosecutor -- the remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform?     That the prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does?       You conceded -- you conceded he had a fair trial.       That's not in the case.       It can't be a charade and still be fair.
10-218 +++$+++       Mr. Garre, what is -- you 24     say that you're not taking just -- you look at the whole 25     river as a whole.    You're saying that, no, that isn't your position?      And it is also not inch 4     by inch.    So, what's -- when is segmentation 5     appropriate?      So, you just -- so, you 5     are disagreeing with the United States, which has given 6     us its view of what the Federal law is.    It doesn't 7     coincide with Montana's.

What would the judge respond?       We have three justices of this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had to do only with multiple causes.       They -- they -- they did ask for proximate cause?
10-238 +++$+++ 
10-277 +++$+++        Isn't this something that would be -- I mean, this -- we're not just talking about getting your foot in the door.     We're talking about certifying the class, and you may well lose on every one of these points, but -- but the 23(a) standards, they're not supposed to be very difficult to overcome.     It's just a common question of fact -       -- that dominates at that -       But what seems to me is a very serious problem in this case is:     How do you work out the back pay?     You say -- we get through the 23(a) threshold.     We got class certified under 23(b)(2).     And the judge says, there's no way I could possibly try each of these individuals.     So, we're going to do it how? How are they going to calculate the back pay?       The district judge didn't think so.     Didn't the district judge say that in awarding back pay some would get a windfall and others would be uncompensated?       I thought -- I thought his point was not simply that some women were not underpaid, but women, if you had an individual case, the employer might show this person could have been fired, disciplined, and wasn't owed any back pay, not that she compares favorably to a -- a male peer, but that she wouldn't have gotten any pay at all.       I thought, didn't the district judge say because of the numbers we couldn't - couldn't possibly have the hearing in each case on whether the particular woman was owed back pay?     They did say something about this.       I thought he said "impossible."       I thought he said more than difficult.       One thing you haven't touched on is to -- to have, first of all the question of whether (b)(2) is limited to injunction and declaratory relief.       But if -- if you follow the advisory committee's note, then if dollars -- if damages predominates -- if damages predominate, then you can't use (b)(2).     You have to make your case under (b)(3); and the one factor here is that about half the class is gone, so -- they're not interested in injunctive relief, but everybody's interested in money. So, why isn't the money -- why do you say that the - that the injunction -- injunctive relief is the thing and the damages are lesser, rather than the other way around?
10-290 +++$+++        How actively do we acquiesce?       Would you agree, looking to Judge Rich's opinions, that it would have been in order for the judge to instruct, if the judge had been asked to do so, that the evidence would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented, defendant's evidence would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented to the Patent Office?       But -- but why -- why - why not, Mr. Waxman?     If the whole reason for this extra deference, for this clear and convincing standard is a Patent Office is expert and so we defer juries similarly to defer to their judgment, but if they haven't judged anything, what is the justification for continuing to have the clear and convincing standard?
10-313 +++$+++ 
10-382 +++$+++        Mr. Gordon -       I thought Riggs -- you said Riggs was a case where the trust fund paid the lawyer, and the Court distinguished cases where that wasn't so, where the trustee was paying the lawyer for the trustee's own protection, and the Court went out of its way to say we are dealing with a case where the lawyer is paid out of trust funds.     In Riggs, the - case, right?       You make a distinction, I -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and work product.     Initially, you were seeking both on the theory that the tribe is in fact the client, but apparently you are not pressing that point any more about work product?       The government is maintaining throughout that it wears two hats.     On the one hand it is a guardian or a trustee, and on the other hand it is the sovereign.     So it's the latter, the government's claim that it is the sovereign, that makes the difference, it's not the -
10-444 +++$+++        But he's -- the Missouri Supreme Court said in what -- that the prosecutor -- they would not -- they would not order the prosecutor to renew that earlier plea.     So, they said the options were you can get a new trial -- you can get a trial or you can replead the open plea.     But wasn't it -- didn't the court say we will not order the prosecutor to reinstate the earlier offer?       But you are -- you are leaving out of the picture the prosecutor's prerogative to withdraw his plea.     That you said that the court -- said it lacked authority to order the State to offer any bargain, but also the court said, I'm not going to require the prosecutor to renew an earlier offer. One thing is clear in this case:     The prosecutor did nothing wrong.     The wrong was on the part of defense counsel.     So, why should the judge disarm the prosecutor, take away the prosecutor's right to change his mind?       And that's -- is that the question that the Court raised?       So, the Court was expecting you to address it.       Are -- are you recognizing that the remedy that the Missouri Supreme Court did give was a futile remedy?     That is, to plead guilty, to have another open plea or trial, because this defendant apparently doesn't want to go to trial.       But why should -- now that we know what the judge's sentence was, and part of the plea offer was remade, the part about -- what was it -- 3 years with 10 days in jail?       And the judge said, no, I'm not going to give him just 10 days; I'm going to put him in jail for the whole 3 years.     Now, if that's -- this is the sentence that the judge gave, he rejected the -- half of the plea bargain, so surely he would have rejected the more generous one.
10-507 +++$+++        Is there any injury on land in the course of employment that would not be covered by OCSLA where we have a worker of this kind that -- who spends 98 percent of his time on the outer continental shelf -- the injury, however, is on land? Is there any case where such a worker who predominantly works on the outer continental shelf would not be covered by OCSLA in your view?       So, then what you're really saying is -- it's not your test, but really the Government's saying we look to see, is this person dominantly working on the outer continental shelf?       You -- you're talking about the Chandris standard that the seaman's relationship to the vessel must be substantial in nature and duration --       And that's a kind of a vague -- what's substantial?     It's the same problem we have here.     What is the --       Yes.     So, how have courts worked this out?     What is a substantial relation to the vessel?

10-5400 +++$+++        Prisons have multiple treatment programs.       And they have vocational treatment.     Do you -- are you relying at all on the fact that in the supervised release term, the judge can say this man or this woman needs rehabilitation, and I want this program for her, but in the prison setting, the judge, this judge -- as the colloquy with Justice Scalia showed, this judge wanted her to be in the program, but she never got into it because the judge has no control?       I could follow your argument much better if the judge could say that this specialized program -- as I am making that a term of your incarceration.     The disturbing factor about your argument is the judge can only recommend; the judge has no way of making sure that this person will be in prison longer and get the treatment the -- the judge wants, because the judge can't control where the person will serve her sentence and what treatment will be available for her.       Wasn't there something - you responded that she didn't -- she said I'd rather not.     But wasn't there something about placing her with -- in the same facility as another inmate?     Wasn't that involved?       But wouldn't your proposal lead to unevenness in sentencing?     If you -- if you're right, then this choice of extending a term to accommodate a drug program, that could be -- the judge would have the option.     I think nearly half of the people who are incarcerated have a drug addiction.     So one judge might say:     I'm not going to let that person out until they -- they should at least have a chance to get into this program.     And another will say:     I can't control that; I'm not going to subject -- you would be introducing that, just what the framers of the Reform Act were trying to get away from, that this swings from one judge to another, and you're dealing with almost half the prison population.

10-568 +++$+++        Mr. Rosenkranz, you are not -- is it right that you are not challenging any part of this statute except the one that -- that says "substantially similar"?     The rest you have no constitutional objection to; is that right?       -- no -- there's no -- I thought this -- the -- the only reason that we have this case is that the three-time campaign manager was -- did have a financial stake in this vote because the project was approved.       It doesn't seem to be different from the ones that Mr. Elwood read to us. I think he read probably one from New Jersey and -       Is there any catch-all that you would say would pass your constitutional test? You told us that the four specific categories, member of the household, employer, that those are all right because they're specific.     But you don't like the "substantially similar."     Is there any catch-all that a legislature could adopt that would pass what you - what's constitutional?       In the -- in the Nevada court you argued overbreadth.     That was the -- at least how the court understood your challenge, and here overbreadth takes a back seat, and vagueness is the principle on which you rely dominantly. So what accounts for the shift?     You were arguing overbreadth before the Nevada Supreme Court.
10-577 +++$+++        But 7206 is the lesser offense.     I mean, you don't take -- you don't dispute that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is, evasion.     It gets a more severe penalty.     And when Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only, why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant with respect to aggravated felonies?     That there's one tax crime, the most serious tax crime, that fits that label.     And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many, many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and loss to the victim?       But that was one of the problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which actually you considered, that reading the (M)(i) to include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and local level.     It would really swell the category of tax crimes that lead to deportation.     That -- did Congress really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons? And then there was a very practical point made, that the government is going to be hurt more than helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that very often the government will try to make a bargain. It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard to prove.     So, they offer as a plea bargain 7206.     And if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there will be many, many people who will say:     If it's a question of whether I get thrown out of the United States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead to something that will mean immediately when I serve my time I will be thrown out of the United States.       There's a technical aspect of this case I don't understand.     Maybe you can explain it.     There was a question about what might be the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife.     Why should the revenue loss be different?     She's -- she's convicted of aiding and abetting.
10-6 +++$+++        Where are you reading from, Mr. Cruz?       They're dealing -       They're dealing with a Federal Circuit decision, they're reviewing that decision, the Federal Circuit had a formula.     It said standard is deliberate disregard of a known risk.     One thing you must surely do is to say whether that standard is right or wrong. So the Federal Circuit, whatever the jury found, Federal Circuit said the law is that you are liable under 271(b) if you are deliberately -- if you deliberately disregard a known risk.     Is that standard the right one?
10-63 +++$+++        Mr. Neiman, I think we're blurring two issues.     We're not talking about abandonment in this respect.     We're talking about notice going to no one, and a -- and a clock ticking from a certain date that no one knows about. I mean, they were preparing for a hearing before this judge.     So they weren't anticipating that he was going to rule without anything further.       But as far as -- as far the record shows, De Leeuw is not on the record at all. There were three counsel of record.     Two of them -- well, let's go back to this -- this -- the first issue. The State by its own conduct showed it didn't regard Butler as any kind of representative, because it didn't even send its Rule 32 response to Butler; isn't that so?       What about --       What about the notice that he's -- he had lost in the Alabama court and he'd better, if he wants to go to the Federal court, do something about it?     That notice went only to Maples, right?       And Mr. Garre made the point that if Maples were represented, that that would be improper, to -- to send a notice to Maples alone. So, the -- so, the State's attorney must have thought that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers because he didn't notify any of them.       But we do know they weren't counsel of record.     We do know that the only two counsel of record were no longer representing him, and he had no reason to know that they weren't, but they were not -- they couldn't represent him. The two -- the only two out-of-town counsel were the two who disabled themselves from representing him by taking other jobs.       So, there was no one from Sullivan & Cromwell other than those two on the record. So, on the record, they had abandoned him, and there was no substitute.       Did you -- did you oppose it?     Did the State oppose the out-of-time appeal?       When -- when lawyers stop representing a client, as the two did, isn't there some obligation of them to tell the client and the court, we're no longer representing you, and arrange for substitutions?     There were never any substitutions on the record of the other counsel.     The record said these two people are representing Maples, and those two weren't.     They never told the court, and they never told Maples.     Isn't there some obligation on -- on their part to the court when they stop representing a client to advise the court?       Then why did they -- why did they send to Maples alone the notice, you'd better file your Federal habeas?     They didn't send it to those counsel.     Where did they -- what made them send it -- send that notice directly to Maples and not to either of the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers?

10-680 +++$+++        I thought that there was no discussion of the "in custody" point in Mathis.     It was assumed that they were in custody, and the issue was whether he could be questioned about a crime other than the one for which he was being held.       I thought you were going back to Miranda itself, which says in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.       So -- and I think you repeated the phrase from -- from Miranda that what the Court was aiming at was incommunicado interrogation of an individual in a police-dominated atmosphere.     The question is whether the Court has modified what Miranda said in -- in that regard.       This Court, this Court, because this Court now seems to assume that it must be in custody and not -- not otherwise deprived of action, that being in custody is essential.       Yes, I think you did.       Well, their question -- the question is, is the person entitled to Miranda warnings?     And the argument has been that they're not entitled to Miranda warnings unless you're in custody. They say:     You want to have a per se rule for in custody; that is, if you're taken out of your cell and put in another place under police guard and questioned.       There's no indication that he told -- that he told the --       -- officers that he needed medication.
10-694 +++$+++        Is -- is there any aggravated felony crime of violence that is not a crime involving moral turpitude?       Was Judulang's crime a crime involving violence?       I mean a crime of moral turpitude.       What -- what -       But what your position means that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who makes the charge, because take Mr. Judulang, he could have been categorized as deportable because he committed a crime involving moral turpitude, or he could have been categorized as somebody who committed an aggravated felony.     It is then totally in the hands of the person who is making the charge whether there will be a match or not.       But that doesn't -- if the -- if the officer labels the manslaughter in this case a crime involving moral turpitude, then there's a match -       And if he labels it aggravated felony crime of violence, then there's no match.     So, it's up to the charger whether there will be this match or not.       Then -- then you have to say, yes, you can have somebody who would get a waiver of inadmissibility for a crime and the very next day be put in deportation without any waiver for that same crime.       But I'm giving you -       -- these categories -       These categories.       Mr. Gannon, in your brief, I thought you'd conceded that.       That -- just the example that Justice Sotomayor gave.     Somebody is declared inadmissible because it's a crime.     This manslaughter or aggravated felony crime of violence is on the admissibility side a crime involving moral turpitude. So, he's allowed in.     And then he's in and he's declared deportable, and he can't get a waiver because there's no analogue.     I thought your brief said, yes, that's the consequence of our argument; however, prosecutors would not seek deportation if inadmissibility had been waived.       Right.       But he also said that there are only two grounds for deportation that have no analogue in the grounds for exclusion.       Entry without inspection and firearms conviction.
10-699 +++$+++        What of all the -       The two examples that are given in the brief, one of Texas, where Petitioner says there was a case where Congress went first -- Congress recognized and the President acquiesced, and the same thing with Taiwan; it was a statute and the President implemented it.     So, if the -- Congress thought it had the authority, the recognition authority, in those two measures, and the President acquiesced.       Why not all the way? I mean, if the Court decides that the Constitution commits this authority exclusively to the President, then it's all over.     That's the merits of the case:     Does the President have this authority?     So, the political question label seems to be kind of a -- a subterfuge because if there is a textual commission -- commitment to the President, that's the end of the case.       Then -- General Verrilli, then you are taking the position that this is not a shared authority; it's an exclusive authority, that there is no role for Congress.     Am I right?     Or is there some role in recognition for -- for Congress?       But that is still - that's a merits determination.     The whole question is, who has the authority?     And whatever label you put on it, if you decide that the President has, as you just said, the exclusive authority, that's the end of the matter.     It -- it's not leaving it -- it is not leaving it, as Justice Breyer said, to the political branches to fight it out between them.     It is saying the President has the exclusive authority.
10-704 +++$+++       Mr. Wolfson, if -- 10     suppose they had had a warrant to search just for the 11     sawed-off shotgun.    You conceded that when they go into 12     the house and they're looking all over, they could look 13     in cabinets and drawers for the -- to find pieces of the 14     shotgun.    They come across other guns, they can at least 15     secure -- take those guns for their own safety.    There 16     are other people in the house, and somebody might use 17     them. So, what's -- what's the difference in the 19     scope of the search if they have a warrant just to look 20     for the sawed-off shotgun or if they have a warrant that 21     covers any guns?      What happened here when 22     they -- when they -- they did seize weapons that belonged to the plaintiff, Mrs. Millender.    They -- they 24     took them because they thought they were the defendant's?    But -- not that -- they thought they were Bowen's?
10-708 +++$+++       Is that -- is that right? I thought --      Mr. Lamken, you're not 14     seeking damages.    You're seeking what the statute says 15     you can get, which is your money back treble?      So, it's not that you 20     have to prove --
10-76 +++$+++        I think there's something very new about this, because general jurisdiction is all-purpose jurisdiction, and for a corporation it's sort of like a residence for an individual.     I think Mr. Feder was making that point. What's -- what's troubling here is that the North Carolina court seems to be blending the two together:     specific jurisdiction based on the claim arising in the forum, and general jurisdiction with a claim that has nothing to do with the forum, and its insertion of jurisdiction over any and all claims.     And I do not know of any case post-International Shoe -- the only thing that we have is Perkins v. Benguet. Is there -- is there any case in which this Court has sanctioned the assertion of general jurisdiction based on some prior -- some product coming into the State, not the product that caused the injury abroad?     I don't know of any case.       Ms. Peddie, you haven't -- you don't have anything in the record about this being a unitary business.     Unless you're trying to present some sweeping piercing-the-corporate-veil theory, there is nothing here that says that these aren't corporations that are acting separately, that have their own officers, have their own employees, keep their own books.     There's nothing to show that it's all part of one enterprise.       But the "it" wasn't the product that caused the injury here.     As I understand the case, the tire that allegedly caused this bus to turn over was designed for the European and Asian markets, not the U.S. market.       But why did -- why should -- Mr. Feder brought up the Helicopteros, and he said in that case, it was purchases; and in this case, it's sales.     And in the purchaser case, certainly we said no, there's no general jurisdiction.     Why should it be any different?       In Perkins, it was the home of the corporation.     There was no other at the time, because their permanent home was not functioning because of the war.     So there was only one place.       He was the president of the corporation.       And whatever business it was doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio.       May I ask you about the ramifications of your theory that there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina over these three subsidiaries? Suppose that one of the children on a bus was a Canadian citizen, was going home to Canada.     And had the idea that juries in North Carolina are more liberal than in France.     Well, there wouldn't be any jury in France, but -- so could the Canadian come and sue because there's general jurisdiction in the United States?       No, you -- we're talking about Goodyear and these three subsidiaries.     You say there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina.     Those companies can be sued on any and all claims. So my question is:     Could anyone on that bus that turned over in Paris come to North Carolina to bring the wrongful death, or whatever, suit?       Do you have any case law that supports your position, which, I take it -- and correct me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is subject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long as some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by the parent to the -- to buyers in the forum State?       I see nothing in the North Carolina court's opinion that explains that this is the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate the distinction between parent and sub.       There's -- there's a - you open your brief saying something to the effect of this case is about outsourcing, jobs in the U.S. going to some subsidiary port.     But then these subsidiaries are making tires which, on your own admission, very rarely come to the United States because they're designed specifically for vehicles in Asia and in Europe.     And so I would think that Turkey would be the ideal location for -- for such a place.     I don't get your outsourcing pitch.       Could you go back? You -- you said something about the two of them are subject to suit.     You said this is a question of one lawsuit instead of four.     Could you explain that?       What about France?       It's not a question of more convenience.     It's a question that the claim arose there, and then, of course, there was -- just because the claim arose there, there would be some convenience factors.     All the witnesses to the accident are there; whatever is left of the bus is there.
10-779 +++$+++        I asked whether there are sales to any other entities.       May I stop you?       You say that this statute doesn't give the patient any control.     But the patient is already taken care of by the Federal law.     You can't -- I mean, the patient is protected.     The question is whether the physician should be as well.
10-788 +++$+++        Then you agree with the -- with the position that the United States took, which is you can -- if there were -- there was evidence outside the grand jury proceeding that this person was the instigator, that that could be the basis for a malicious prosecution 1983 claim?     I thought the United States' position was:     We're not going to use the testimony before the grand jury, but if this person did things outside the grand jury to instigate the prosecution, that's -- that could --       Well, let's go back one stage.     Let's go back to an arrest warrant.     The witness -- and the concern that the affidavit in support of the warrant is filled with lies.     The affidavit is presented to a judge.     And I would think that's better than a prosecutor.     And yet, there is no absolute immunity for someone who lies in order to get a warrant, even though the judge makes the judgment whether the warrant should issue.       Suppose -- suppose we had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation. Would there be -- would there be absolute immunity then for the affidavit that supports the accusation which will begin the prosecution?       No.     We take the grand jury out of it.     We're going to begin the case, the prosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia law refers to something called an accusation.     If -- if we're not before a grand jury and the prosecution is instituted by an information and there is an affidavit supporting that information, is there absolute immunity for the false affidavit in support of the information?       But you -- you cited a provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate what's called an accusation with an indictment.     It's on the bottom of page 22:     "All legal proceedings by which a person's liability for a crime is determined, commencing with the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation." So, if the Georgia Code equates those two, the return of the indictment or the filing of the accusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same for the two?     And you told me that Malley would cover the filing of the accusation.     So, why shouldn't it be the same for the return of the indictment?       Do you regard the grand jury as a judicial proceeding?       But -- but there's no judge.     And it seems to me odd to say -- there's no presiding judge, there's no cross-examination.     And the indictment has the same function as an information.     So, why should it rank as a judicial proceeding?       And that would go for the prosecutor, too, right?       For the information?     If you -- if you bracket it with Malley, the -- the prosecutor who lies to the magistrate is not going to have absolute immunity at the arrest warrant stage.     Is the prosecutor absolutely immune for making out an information that's packed with lies?       Why isn't -- why isn't an arrest warrant intimately associated?
10-8145 +++$+++        Does this -- was this line-up -- was this after Boatner saw the photograph in the newspaper?       And that was before or after the picture in the paper?       But how could it not be material?     Here is the only eyewitness --       -- and we have inconsistent statements.     Are you really urging that the prior statements were immaterial?       How does that make it not material?     You can argue that it should be given diminished weight.     But an inconsistent statement by the only eyewitness seems to me most material and useful to the defense in cross-examining the eyewitness.     I really don't understand how you can -- you can argue that the jury shouldn't put much weight on it because there were these other things; but to say that it's immaterial I find that that is -- is not plausible.       But it is a description that others, other suspects, fit.     The close-cut hair, the gold teeth.     That didn't identify Smith, as opposed to the other suspects who had those same characteristics.       It was a prior inconsistent statement, and we can argue about whether there were more consistent statements than inconsistent statements, but to say that this was not Brady material, we -- we're not saying that Larry Boatner made up a story on the stand that wasn't -- didn't conform to the truth.     The question is, should the prosecutor -- should the defense attorney have access to a prior inconsistent statement?       But Kyles is a decision saying what the prosecutor must disclose, not it's a good practice.       How do you know?     How do you know?     How can you possibly know?     The jury is supposed to decide on the credibility of this witness. There's a statement that he made a prior inconsistent statement.     The -- Mr. Shanmugam outlined five categories of what he called Brady material.     Is -- are you maintaining that none of those categories, that there was no Brady material at all in this case?       Yes.       I'm talking about Mims and -- what was the woman's name?     Russell?       And Young and the snitch, the one who said that his cellmate told him that his cellmate was the perpetrator.       Was it a determination by the judge that it wasn't a dying declaration?       And how about Mims?       But isn't it most unlikely, as your -- as Mr. Shanmugam said, that robbers -- I mean, the people who are entering, intruding on another's premises to rob, or whatever else they're going to do, would wear masks going out but not going in?     I mean, they don't want anybody -- they don't want anybody to be able to identify them.       Well, is that maybe --       But you're taking that judgment away from the jury.     There was a prior inconsistent statement.     Shouldn't that be the end of it?     A prior inconsistent statement, one that is favorable to the defense, has to be turned over, period. I thought was what Brady requires.
10-844 +++$+++       What you -- what you 7     described sounded very much like this case.    So, if the 8     -- what was the D.C. Circuit case?    If -- if the D.C. 9     Circuit said it's arbitrary and capricious not to -- to just accept the -- the brand's use code --      What was fixed?    I missed 16     what you said.    What was fixed in the counterclaim? 17                 MR. PERRY      I can't imagine that that 20     would really come to -- I mean, if it's a transposition 21     of numbers, that there would be -- have to be a proceeding to get it changed.    I mean, the minute that 23     was noticed, I assume that the brand manufacturer would 24     change it.      Mr. Perry, may I ask you, 25     on that core question alone.    It expires, and then the patent holder gets a 2     label patent that's on a method of use, and we have a 3     generic that wants to sell the drug alone which is no 4     longer patented.    Doesn't want to sell it in combination 5     with anything else.    Wants to sell the drug alone. 6                 Can it do so without infringing the 7     method-of-use patent?
10-8505 +++$+++       You -- you said 20     "independent," and I don't -- you said that in your 21     brief.    I don't understand how Lambatos's testimony can 22     be independent of the test results supplied.    I mean, 23     it's based on the test results.    She -- it can't be 24     independent of them because it's entirely dependent on 25     them.      If the report had been 3     introduced, the Cellmark report, it would be 4     testimonial; is that -- is that right?      Well, how does it 13     become --      How does it become 17     non-testimonial when it's relayed by the recipient of 18     the report?    I mean, if -- if the -- you're not      I thought you earlier 8     recognized that her -- her opinion could not be independent of the test results.    It depended entirely 10     on the test results.    So, I -- now you've -- you've 11     inserted "independent" again, and I thought you had -- 12     you had given up on that.      It does not?
10-875 +++$+++       So, what -- what farm 6     sales would be included?    What farm sales would get this 7     benefit that Senator Grassley obviously wanted them to 8     have?      How about employment tax? 20     Employment taxes?      What would be -- what 24     would be the right way?
10-879 +++$+++        I thought that that was not the nature of the notice claim.     The design is whatever it is.     But the manufacturer has to issue warnings so that the worker can protect himself against that hazard.     So, I thought that the defective design -- yes, I understand your argument.     You would have one standard for on the line and another when it's in the repair shop.     But this is not telling them to change the design in any respect.     It just says:     Asbestos -- you could take these measures to protect yourself.
10-895 +++$+++        Can we back up and tell me why which statute we're dealing with, 2253 -- why that's jurisdictional if "jurisdiction" means, as we have said, that class of cases that the court is competent to hear.     So, I look at 2254.     That's State habeas.       Federal petition by a State prisoner.     And 2255 is a petition by a Federal prisoner.     So, those are the class of cases.     The class of cases are habeas cases, '54 State prisoners, '55 Federal prisoners.       2253, it seems to me, is a processing rule that applies to both categories.     It applies to '54, and it applies to '55, but the classes of cases are identified in '54 and '55.     So, I would write 2253 as a mandatory processing rule but not -- not a rule that tells us what class of cases the court is competent to here.       So that it doubles as -- 2254 is jurisdictional; 2255, and then 2253, which tells how you are to proceed under either one of those, is not simply a mandatory how you do it but jurisdictional.       The feature of this case that I think is very unsettling is there is an issue for the court of appeals to decide.     It's the timeliness issue.     The court of appeals could not decide the speedy trial.     If -- if this case were to fail because the trial judge didn't identify the speedy trial issue when the court of appeals in no way could reach that issue in this case, isn't that something only a -- a distinction only a lawyer could love? (Laughter.)       If you say -- if you say that -- here's Judge Gaza, and he says:     Yes, there's a statute of limitations question here; it has to be decided before we get to the speedy trial.     But if the judge felt that the speedy trial issue was not meritorious, then why would he grant a certificate of appealability on the threshold question that you have to decide before?     Because, it seems to me, it would be a waste of everyone's time if the judge thought that the speedy trial issue had no merit.       In this -- in this very case, that was so, right?     Because the -- the period for discretionary review expired in August.       And the mandate issued on September -- some date in September.       So, there could be no State habeas until the mandate issued.     So, the days in between would count against the defendant on the speedy trial clock, even though he would -- he could not have filed a State habeas; he could not have stopped the clock by filing a State habeas.       So, if someone on the court of appeals noticed that, yes, the certificate pinpoints the only case -- only question that the panel can decide at this juncture, but there is a lurking constitutional question, then isn't 28 U.S.C. 1653 exactly what the panel would do?     That is, 1653 says that defective jurisdictional allegations can be amended in the trial or the appellate court.     And so, all that would have had to have happened is very much in line with Justice Breyer's questions, is the judge on the panel said, oh, the certificate of appealability didn't mention the speedy trial issue.     So, counsel, would you like to amend, or we on our own will amend to put that question in?       Well, the appeal couldn't go forward on that issue because that issue hasn't been decided below.     The one thing we know is the speedy trial issue -- the case cannot go forward on the speedy trial issue.     Isn't that right?       Why?       How common is it for courts of appeals to reach substantive issues in the first instance --       -- when there's no decision of the district court?       Wouldn't -- wouldn't the most sensible procedure be -- let's forget the intricacies of 2244 and '53.     But you -- you have a case where there's a statute of limitations question, and that has come up for review.     Wouldn't the court of appeals 99 out of 100 times say now the substantive -- since we've decided that the case is timely, then it is district court's function to resolve the substantive issue?
10-8974 +++$+++ 
10-930 +++$+++        Why couldn't you use the transcript?     Everything -- all -- all the exchanges between the defendant -- defendant and the trial judge are in the transcript.       The district judge in this case explained why he concluded that there was no issue that couldn't be fairly adjudicated on the basis of the record.     What was wrong with his -- his explanation?     He looked at the case carefully, and he said, there's nothing that can't fairly be adjudicated on the record.       Treatment stopped because he -- he said there were side effects?
10-945 +++$+++        Are there any limits - are there any constitutional limits, in your view?     You say you didn't attempt the kind of search that was done in Bell v. Wolfish.     Is there any constitutional impediment to your doing so?       So, there's no -       You are saying that they can do the full -- as far as the Constitution is concerned, all of these searches are permissible.       In Bell v. Wolfish -       But they did -- they did stress that there was a visitor who could -- who could give the inmate contraband.     Bell v. Wolfish doesn't - and I asked Mr. Goldstein whether we know whether the pretrial detainees in New York were searched that way on entry, and he said there's nothing that shows one way or the other.       Then how does that -       That's not the Federal rule.     And, by the way, the brief was really confusing. When what -- when I read page 1, page 1 tells me that the BOP policy requires all incoming pretrial detainees to be subject to visual body cavity inspections.     And then it isn't until page 30 that I learn there is an exception for the very category of arrestee that we're talking about here, that they are not subject to body cavity inspections unless there's reasonable suspicion that they're concealing contraband.     That the misdemeanor or civil contempt offender is not subject.       Yes, but I want to know how people in this category are treated in the Federal system.     And you -- you -       You reversed it.     They - those people are not subject to this visual body cavity search.       What is the reason?     If there's so much sense to that policy, why isn't it the Federal policy?     Before you said because there aren't that many offenders.     If there were more, then would there be -- would the Federal policy change so that even people who are in on a contempt charge or a minor crime -       I'm sorry, I didn't understand.     You think the Feds think it's a good policy to inspect everyone?
10-948 +++$+++        What else is non-waivable besides the 3 days to back out?       Would your position of right to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a post-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate?       Another argument that is made, in opposition to your position, is that the statute says any waiver of any protection or right may not be enforced by any court or any other person.     And the suggestion is "any other person" must contemplate an alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court -- court or any other person.
10-9646 +++$+++        Was it -- was it a factor in Miller's case?     Was there a lesser -- lesser offense that was charged?       He was -- the -- there was also a felony murder charge in the Miller case?      Is --      Is it taken into account when the -- the child is in the juvenile system initially, has to be moved to the adult system.    Is the judgment -- is there any cutoff on the transfer?    Or can a child be transferred to the adult system at any age?       So, if you're -- if you're under 14, you can't be transferred out of the juvenile system?       So, if he were only 13, he would get out when?     When he was 21?       That's in -- in the Jackson case.     In the Jackson case, the crime was very similar to --

10-9995 +++$+++        But this wasn't failure to raise an argument; this was representing to the court we will not challenge timeliness.     That was the representation made to the court.     That was not negligent oversight in not raising the question.     It was an affirmative representation to the court that, although we might have done it, we will not challenge timeliness.       But the consequence of that was the district court then had to deal with the case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted claims and rule on them, after having told the district court you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of limitations, we will not challenge timeliness.     So, you put the district court to the necessity of deciding the case on the merits.     It does.     It takes up the two unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits. In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired between the State saying the claim was timely and the magistrate's detection of the computation error.     The district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work. If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with them on the merits. In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the question because counsel thought that it was timely.     He had miscalculated and made a mathematical error.     And the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of days that's required by statute, they have run.     And as Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could have said:     Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't you like to amend your complaint and put it in a defense? So, the two cases, the two situations are -- are so different.     The district judge wasn't -- nobody was made to do anything extra.     But in -- here, because the attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had to deal with the case on the merits.       There is something about the principle of party presentation.     The party raises the issue.     The court of appeals is the court of review, not first view.     Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did not know that he had a statute of limitations defense, that -- did not know because he had miscalculated the time.     Here the State knew very well that it did have a statute of limitations argument, but it says we're not challenging it. And then the ordinary thing is that a court of appeals reviews decisions of the district court; doesn't decide questions in the first instance.     But here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge don't decide this; go on to the merits.     Then the court of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the district court does, instead deals with that question in the first instance.     That seems like an odd inversion of the role of the -- of the district court and court of appeals.       You didn't say we're going to refrain from it.     You said, District Judge, Your Honor, we will not challenge timeliness.       Didn't have any qualifications.       And the difference is that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of limitations defense.     So -- but the court suggested it. In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the court we won't challenge timeliness. It seems a big difference between the factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know there was a statute of limitations defense, and this one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal with that issue.       Except we have a system where the court doesn't raise issue on its own.     The ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the party says to the court we will not challenge timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the defense.     It's affirmatively representing to the court that we -- we are not making this an issue.       But Day did say that if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense, then no court can bring it up.     The party has made the choice.
105, Orig. +++$+++                 But we don't know -- - General Suthers, do we know what has happened in past original jurisdiction cases?            Maybe it hasn't come up because other special masters have said, we'll give the expert witness a reasonable fee for services commensurate with the qualifications and the work that the expert has done.       We don't know if that has or hasn't happened in the past, do we?                 Did you find any cases where the special master had appointed his own witness as distinguished from the parties?                 But you -- but you recognize that if a special master appointed a witness, or the court, that that witness would be paid a compensatory fee?                 Now, in a -- in a case like this one, where the nature of the work that the expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides, isn't it odd that the special master chose the court expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if you have one party calls an expert who renders great service to the Court, to both sides, doesn't get compensated?    Isn't that an anomaly?               Parties pay a lot -- a lot of expenses and then they may be -- may or not be reimbursed to the prevailing party; but the prevailing party in our system certainly doesn't get anything like the full cost of the litigation.
11-10189 +++$+++        Why is it a second bite when the Texas Supreme Court -- court of criminal appeals, has said, again and again, as a general rule, defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on collateral review?       I don't -- does the statement "defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal" doesn't mean what it says?       And the Fifth Circuit was wrong, the circuit that ruled in favor of Texas, but said, in the Ibarra case, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions -- and the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle for developing ineffective assistance claims? Page 25 Was that wrong?       Mr. Oldham, do we have a clue, Mr. Oldham, if the information is correct, that direct appeal counsel in the county involved here gets a very limited amount of money -- gets, they said it's $1,500 fixed fee. But, if counsel who's appointed as collateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest that the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is Page 33 expected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets all this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a sociologist, whoever is going to give us a profile on this person?       Is it true that it's the county that reimburses the direct appeal counsel and the State reimburses the habeas counsel?       Has there ever been such a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has been held ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins claim?       But I asked, if there was any decisions that says, you should have raised it on appeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because counsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, she was ineffective?       Well, the -- the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review, said -- and there's a reason.     The reason why is the undeveloped record on direct appeal would be insufficient to establish claims that must be supported by extra-record evidence. So that seems to be an expectation that extra-record evidence will be developed on collateral review, not direct appeal.
11-1025 +++$+++        Mr. Jaffer, could you be clear on the expanded authority under the FAA?     As I understood it, it's not like in the old statute, where a target was identified and FISA decided whether there was -- the court decided whether there was probable cause.     Under this new statute, the government doesn't say who the particular person or the particular location.     So, there isn't that check.     There isn't that check.       What other measures besides having to travel to have conversations?       Well, the travel overseas I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount attached to it.       But these others -- these other precautions, being more circumspect in their questions, talking in generalities --       Yes.
11-10362 +++$+++        May I ask, in light of your opening statement, are you then abandoning your position that it must be either arrest, search or seizure?     You have used the Ninth Circuit formula.       Is it a limitation?     Is scope a limitation?     I thought that you -- you didn't question that, that scope is a limitation on the conduct that's covered, right?       What about the takedown that occurred here and I -- it's not uncommon.     The -- your definition includes three things, arrest, search, seizure.     And correctional officers do engage in searches of cells for contraband, and they do engage in seizures.     Those are not -- this isn't like arrest, which you point out the arrest is unusual; it's an escapee or a visitor.     But that's not true of search and seizure.       Then scope becomes kind of a surplusage.       It has to be a law enforcement function.     Give -- give me an example of a case where -- where scope would also be relevant, would also be applicable -- if you -- if there is a law enforcement function, then it fits.     So what does scope add?
11-1059 +++$+++        Well, you -- you don't accept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 -- 216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you can commence a suit on behalf of others similarly situated, and implicit in that is that there be some decent interval for you to find similarly-situated people?       Why didn't -- why didn't you file the -- the motion for certification, along with the complaint?       But you could -- you could have done that with the complaint and I don't -- you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to wait?     Why -- why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't the most logical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a collective action, and now, we want to start the ball rolling in getting certification?
11-1085 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick, you say -- you say, you point out, quite rightly, that the efficiency of the market was conceded -- was conceded below.       It was not challenged. Except that now, in -- in Amgen's brief, there is a suggestion that the efficiency of the market is a more sophisticated question.     And it's not my note -- binary, I think is what they said -- it isn't that it's either efficient or it's not efficient; it depends on other factors.
11-1118 +++$+++        What about other areas of exclusive Federal jurisdiction, where the claim, if you are stating it initially, would have to go into Federal court and not State court, say, an antitrust claim, a copyright claim? Is -- is what you're saying about patents, does that go for every area, where initial jurisdiction is exclusively in the Federal court?       Then what's the difference between, say, antitrust and patent?       Issue preclusion applies only to someone who was a party.       But that, certainly, is not binding.     The -- whatever the State -- whatever the State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no binding effect on that question coming into Federal court.       How?       What would happen -- what would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation in Federal court, and the Federal circuit, ultimately, decided the question, that the State court was entirely wrong about this; you don't need a witness. Well, that's the end of it, right?     Once the Federal court decides the question, then whatever the -- the State judge thought was the Federal law is -- is gone.       Anytime -- anytime -- I mean, a lot of patent questions -- as you already pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State court litigations, contract litigations, every time you have a patent question, then must the case go to the Federal court, in your view?       So what is the dividing line between patent questions that belong in State court and patent questions that belong only in Federal court?       Well, why don't you stay within the lines that you give us?     You have said not every patent question that comes up in a State court gets dismissed, just so you can start over in Federal court, what patent questions -- now, let's not talk about breach of fiduciary duty general questions -- what patent questions are properly adjudicated in the State court as part of a lawsuit that --       But what was the substantial Federal matter in Grable?       Yes.     And that was going to control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS.       And you have no counterpart for that here?       But the -- but the Federal court -- you said before that whatever the Federal circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow it the next time there's a case in State court, but the Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the State judge says on experimental use.       And your -- your distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction where the Federal law controls and patent is what? What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law --       -- copyright law.     Why don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same way in those fields?       So your case turns on the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate jurisdiction?       But, if there's a large Federal interest, I mean, that's what you're saying that there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side. If there is that large Federal interest, is it surprising that the government hasn't come into this case, if there's such a Federal interest to be protected?       There's a difference between you and your colleague on what "substantial" means.       And she says it doesn't just mean necessary -- essential in this particular litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many other cases, not just this case and whether there's going to be issue preclusion as to this particular inventor. Those -- I don't see an issue in this case comparable to those.       Whether they -- those questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll decide it, and then they'll be settled.       How likely is that, in practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that the State judges will go their own way?       Would that be the same thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright?
11-1160 +++$+++        Georgia wasn't so sure because didn't it come in originally on the side of the FTC in this case?       Mr. Waxman --       Mr. Waxman, you are essentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets up the hospital authority.     And you -- you're saying this is how we read it.     We start with the antitrust exemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the State has to give it to the subdivision, for the subdivision to have it. Could the Federal court have said, we -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature -- what the Georgia authorities think this statute means? So, could a question have been certified -- I don't know if Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the Georgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this statute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity to the locality -- to the local unit?       But the question is does this -- does this legislature mean that the State is transferring its immunity to this local unit?
11-1175 +++$+++       Ms. Blatt, we do have in this case the views of the government regulators, the FTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we have heard the government's position on the relationship between these two provisions.    Should we give any weight to the interpretation of the government administrators?
11-1221 +++$+++        Mr. Johnson, that -- that is in the OPM manual, but I think Mr. Ruttenberg pointed out that it's 106-some-odd pages.     How are employees covered by this insurance, how are they informed about what the beneficiary designation means?       Mr. Johnson, there are at least one case where the State law would override the beneficiary designation and that's obviously if the beneficiary murdered the -- the insured.     So how does this scheme to displace the beneficiary designated in the policy in the Slayer case requires State law?     Is that -       So you would get there by a Federal common law rule, but then who would get the proceeds?     If the designated beneficiary is out because of the Federal common law that excludes a Slayer, where would you go next?     You'd go to State law, right?       The next one is -- it would be -
11-1231 +++$+++        This -- this agency not more than 3 years extension, that was adopted after notice and comment, and Congress amended this statute several times thereafter, but it left this -- this 3-year outside limit intact.     So if Congress really wanted there to be no leeway at all, then it should have done something about that regulation.       And why -- why do you say that?     I mean, the record that we have says that the CMS failed to use the best available data.     It doesn't say anything about deliberate concealment.       Well, in -- in any event, the Baystate case, which is what revealed all of this, in -- in that case, the district judge there didn't say -- he said they didn't use the best available data. He didn't find any deliberate concealment.       But Justice Scalia was not correct in what he just said.     The 3 years is for the provider.     The 3 -- under the Secretary's regulations, the provider gets an additional 3 years, but no more; isn't that right?       Yes.     But it's not 180 days for them.     It's 180 days, plus an extension up to 3 years.   But are you challenging -- I mean, there is a rule that says that -- there is a regulation that, for fraud, it's -- the time is unlimited.     But that -- that regulation, the government says, applies only to the provider, not to the -- the government. Are you challenging the agency's reading of the word "party" in that regulation?       Did you -- did you make that argument in this case?     I wasn't aware that you had challenged the interpretation of -- of the fraud regulation.       Well, suppose it's just what the Baystate court said it is.     It isn't deliberate concealment, but it is failure to use the best available data. And I take it the argument you just presented is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct.     So just failure to use the best available data, not deliberate concealment, wouldn't make it.       So what -- what circumstances trigger equitable tolling, in your view?       Yes, but suppose that the fact-finding turns out that the -- that there is no deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to use the best available data.       So you would have to prove that before we know whether there is equitable tolling.       Yes, but I'm asking you, if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried out the question of the character of --       Why in your case, even assuming that there might be equitable tolling, here, is it -- is it 10 years later?     And there was this Baystate case going on.     You -- you didn't file immediately after that litigation was instituted.     You waited until those plaintiffs won their case. You waited till there was a decision of the lower court.     So it seems to me you -- you said there's a requirement of diligence.     Why -- why didn't you have to file when you were first on notice, which you would have been from the complaint filed in the Baystate case?       How many -- how many cases are there like this pending, either at the agency level or in court now?
11-1274 +++$+++        And it is a generous period.     It's -- it's 5 years.     And, Mr. Wall, maybe you can explain the SEC's pursuit of this -- of this case. The alleged fraud went on from 1999 to 2002.     It was discovered in 2003.     The SEC waited from 2003 to 2008 to commence suit.     What -- what is the reason for -- for the delay from the time of discovery till the time suit is instituted?
11-1285 +++$+++        Let's go back to what the -- the simple argument.     We have an agreement here, and the plan is asking for what the agreement gives it. Why is the plan unjustly enriched by receiving exactly what the plan entitles it to receive?       Well, couldn't that party simply say, I want to go to the other side of the court? You just made a distinction between the remedy at law and at equity.     This is the plan, and if the plan is told, well, if you go to equity, you get all these extra things.     You could say, I'm asserting my rights at law.       I thought you were discussing the common fund would be the allocation between MCCutchen and the plan.     But now, you seem to be talking only about the attorney's right to come in first.
11-1327 +++$+++        You cannot necessarily --       Mr. Gannon, if we -- if we adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case only.     And I -- I think this characterization, nonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of an element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call it one or call it the other, so that -- that's a difficult line to -- to adopt.
11-1347 +++$+++        You're -- I think you're -- you're --       We -- we have a brief in -- in the case telling us that the question Justice Breyer is posing, would they look at it; they would say it's irrelevant.       Because what her habitual residence was then doesn't matter one whit to us.     We want to know where she is residing now, and that's the reason why the Scottish court would say it's not relevant to the question before us.     Their question is not a treaty question.     Their question is custody of this child.       Mr. Cullen, are you saying that the -- under the treaty, there can be no rereturn order?     Is that what you're saying?     Whether the -- whether the return order was wrong or right, there can be no rereturn?
11-1351 +++$+++        Mr. Shah, this is not always the government's position.     In fact, in a brief to this Court, in the Smith case, the government took the position that Mr. Feldman is presenting to us. What occurred to turn on the light for the government, to see that it was wrong in the Smith case and come up with this -- the interpretation you are now advancing?       Why would -- why would Congress -- I mean, the Veterans Administration Act came after the four or five others, and Congress thought it was patterning that Act after the Gonzalez Act. Why would Congress want to provide this battery remedy if a Veterans Administration medical person messed up, but not if it was an armed service doctor?       Mr. Shah, does it make any sense to distinguish between a medical malpractice, negligence and this unconsented operation, to split those two and say the government is liable for malpractice, but not for this unconsented action.
11-139 +++$+++        But that's got to mean -- that's got to refer to (i).     It can't refer to the -- Harlan said two things.     He said it's ambiguous; therefore, I'm going to look at the legislative history to find out what the predecessor section means. And then he says:     I'm not going to speculate on what this new thing means, but I do want to point out that the result we reach in Colony is in harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501, et cetera.     The only unambiguous language that he could be referring to is in (i) because he has just -- he had said the earlier language was ambiguous.       Well, why would they be redundant?     I mean, if the statute without little (i) meant what you said it meant, then there would be no occasion to put this in, because "omission from gross income" would refer to items of income, period.     That's -- so, what work does (i) do, if it just -- if the main rule, the general rule, is as you say it is?       But it also said before that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the speculative debate between the parties as to whether Congress manifested an intention to clarify or -- clarify or change the 1939 code.     So, not taking a position on whether the new section changes the code. And the part that is in harmony -- I can't see how that could be read to mean anything other than the (i), which is unambiguous and certainly in harmony with the result in Colony.       But as I read it, it isn't saying and Colony controls; it's saying we're not going to take a position on what the 1954 code does, whether it clarifies or changes.       But he says "unambiguous language," and he can't mean the general rule because he's already said that is ambiguous.     He's got to mean the new provision, which is certainly unambiguous.       But he did say -- he did say he was looking to --     he said the text isn't clear; therefore, I look to the legislative history.
11-1425 +++$+++        What about that field sobriety test?     Suppose the person who is apprehended and is suspected of being drunk says, I'm not going to walk a straight line.     I'm going to just sit here.     You can't make me do anything without a warrant. Do you need -- if the defendant doesn't consent, do you need a warrant to -- to have the standard sobriety test?       Yes.       What you're saying is if it's now or never --       -- where the other is a slow process.       Mr. Shapiro, before your time runs out, the case of the fingernail --       -- scrapings has been raised as saying well, that's -- somebody is going to scrape your fingernails, that's as intrusive as a blood test.
11-1447 +++$+++        Mr. Wolfson, why isn't it entirely reasonable to say, if you are going to put a condition on a permit, that condition has to have some rough proportionate relationship to the harm that is being done to the permit -- what -- that seems to me perfectly sensible, that if they are going -- if they are going to exact a condition, the condition has to have some discrete proportional relationship to the harm?
11-1450 +++$+++        But your theory doesn't depend on it being just a little over $5 million, the theory would hold whether it was $8 million, $9 million --       Even though you admit in your brief -- you agreed that the stipulation -- I didn't think that this is what you said on page 53, the stipulations can have no effect on absentees, until the Court finds at the certification stage that the stipulation was made in good faith and doesn't render the named plaintiff an inadequate representative. But we have to judge removal at the time removal is made, and at that time, there is no determination of class.     So at the removal stage, the stipulation is inoperative as to the non-named class members.       How is it binding when you said in your brief it doesn't bind the unnamed class members?       Justice Breyer's hypothetical would not come up on your theory because the Federal court would never get the chance to make that determination.     It would be made in the State court.       So would that include the I'm suing for two years when I could have sued for five?
11-1518 +++$+++        So there's nothing in the record that shows why the bank refused to release any of the collateral?
11-1545 +++$+++        Can you -- can you tell me, what is -- what is the ambiguity?     Because I looked at (b).     (B) is limitations.     Limitations is on the State, and then it uses the phrase of what the State cannot do.     The State has to conform to a reasonable time.     What is ambiguous about this?
11-159 +++$+++        But the words -- you say this is plain meaning.     It says the child of a wage earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are importing the term "married," because someone can be the undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried.     So, it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed.     A wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married.       But I thought we weren't supposed to look to (h) at all.     I mean, your thesis is (e) covers it --       -- and there's no reason to refer to (h).       Mr. Rothfeld, don't you run into a problem?     Perhaps not in 1939, but since then this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with the distinction between children born in and out of wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that the distinction between the two is unconstitutional, that there are no illegitimate children.     All children are legitimate, whatever their parents may be.       Yes, but if we are going to apply those equal protection decisions to this statute --       Mr. Rothfeld, these children were born 18 months after the insured wage earner died.     If we look to other categories of children, say, stepchildren -- and there is also one for adopted children.     For stepchildren, they qualify only if they had that status no less than 9 months before the wage earner died, and adopted children is also a limitation.     The stepchild and the adopted child -- there could never be any question of being born months later.     They wouldn't qualify.     There's -- there is a time limit for the other children.     And if Congress had thought about this problem, maybe it would have put a time limit on this, too.       Well, that would be fine if the statute said what you claim it says.     It says a child is a child of a wage earner.     And you'd have to import these things that Congress didn't say to get to what you claim is the plain meaning.     But what do you do with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says "in determining whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter"?     The subchapter is not for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire subchapter, which would include (e).       But how could it do that when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law of intestacy"?       Well, if we're going back to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that the marriage ends when a parent dies?       So, there wouldn't be -- a child that's born 18 months after the father died wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the marriage would have ended.
11-161 +++$+++        They said it could go either way.       It was up to the Oklahoma legislature.     They could make it 21 for everyone or 18 for everyone.
11-166 +++$+++        Wouldn't that be a reason for saying that there's no adequate -- there's nothing under (iii) that would be the indubitable equivalent? In other words, one thing is to say that, if you -- if (ii) -- if you fit into (ii), that's it, you don't go to (iii).     Another is to say, well, you can go to (iii), but it's most unlikely that there would be the indubitable equivalent of allowing credit bidding.       What is the reference? In clause (ii), we were just told, the -- the last clause refers to "under clause (i) or clause (iii)." What -- what is the reference in (ii) to clause (iii)? What does that mean?
11-182 +++$+++ 
11-184 +++$+++        Ms. Harrington, may I just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB, and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed, that's the end of the case, the discrimination claim would never be heard then.       So if the Plaintiff then goes to the district court, then what position does the Government take?       Mr. Schnapper told us in his brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case goes to the district court.       Well, didn't -- in the Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that it didn't go to the Federal circuit?       And so you -- are you -- are you telling us that the position you're representing on behalf of the Government is the position that the MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC would take today?
11-192 +++$+++        May I ask you, Mr. Jacobs --       -- whether you think Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United States, given the multitude of financial transactions in which it engages, ever thought that sovereign immunity would be waived?     I mean, if you're right about this, the consequences are enormous for the Federal fisc.     And we -- the -- the statute developed in a peculiar way. First, there was the definition of person when there was no civil liability, and then some years later the prohibition of having both the credit card number and the expiration date.     In all of it, is there any hint that Congress envisioned a waiver of sovereign immunity in the Fair Credit Reporting Act?       When the definition of persons was put into the statute, there was no civil liability; isn't that right?     So they didn't -- they could not have been thinking about civil liability.
11-199 +++$+++        But, Mr. Yang --       You're going back then to your position in your brief where you said that you would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the length of their deliberations, the divided verdict?     You said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would not include those.       But I thought you answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into account, the court could take them into account but cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight.       You would -- you would take into account that the prosecution apparently thought this was important, so important.     The trial was over.     The prosecutor said:     Judge, I'd like to come back so these tapes can be introduced. That -- the -- we have the witness testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not part of the scheme.     We have no direct evidence, because Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez.     He's at the scene, we know that.     And an explanation, an innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene. And then the government comes back, after everything is done, and says:     We want the jury -- we want these tapes to be before the jury. Isn't that -- don't we take into account that the government itself thought this was very important?       But my point to you is it wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them. And they contain not just the one statement.     There's the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that -- they should take a blind plea.       What was --       What was the line that the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times while she was on the stand, the exact line?       Yes.       The government thought -- thought it was important for the jury to hear it, because they said it three times.       But you -- you are essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a verdict here because there's only one way a rational -- rational jury could come out.       And you read --       You do agree -- you do agree that the government has the burden of showing that the error is harmless?       It's the government's burden.     And you also agree that we should look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in making --       So, what does it mean that the government has the burden?     What does the government have to do?       The absent error.     So, that means -- wait.     You look at just the evidence that's not tainted?
11-204 +++$+++        But it also says -- it also says promotional work incidental to sales made by someone else.       -- is nonexempt.       And these sales -- I mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer.       But it's got to be non- binding.       But that seems to be inconsistent with this -- this opinion letter.     The request is put in by the pharmaceutical company, and they want an exemption under administrative employee. In the Department of Labor's response allowing that exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use the word "detailers," medical detailers, are engaged in a form of promotional or missionary work.       This goes -- the letter goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a form of promotion not having for its object the making of specific transactions.       But as far as your years, it's suspect for two reasons.     One is we're told that in the early years, at least, before there were regulations restricting the sale of prescription drugs, that these detailers did two things.     They did have their informational function, but they also did direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals. So, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these people were engaged in what the department would call sales.     So, that's suspect. And then when we have the commitment, the opinion letter that says we have a category for these people; they are engaged in instruction, in information; they are not engaged in sales; but because they're so independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the particular case we rank them as administrative people. So -- so, it's not so that there was a sudden about-face as you suggest.     We have a categorization as -- as administrative employees, but not sales employees, and we have a history of these detailers at one time actually selling.       Did you claim -- did you claim exemption as administrative employee?       So, that would -- then that would be still open if you lose on the outside sales?       Did -- did the pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period, request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these PSRs?       That was an opinion letter, they said.     I thought they said that was an opinion letter.       Yes.     I asked if there was a request from the pharmaceutical companies for a rulemaking on the proper classification in this case.       Why must you -- why must you look to an amicus brief?     Why not just look to the regulation that defines -- the regulations that define "sale" and that define "promotion"?     The 541.503 says promotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody else is not exempt. Why do we get into the amicus brief when we have in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on the one hand, promotion on the other, and then this statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by somebody else is not exempt? Why doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to this case?       Does the -- does the pharmaceutical company have a sales force?     I mean, who sells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the hospitals?       But there are -- there are people who sell to them.     There may be only a few, but --       Is there -- are they exempt, too?       The -- the actual sellers from the -- the people on the staff of a pharmaceutical company who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and hospitals, are they exempt?
11-210 +++$+++        Why?     I mean, it's expressive.     One is I am speaking through conduct, and the other is I'm speaking through words.     You wear the medal and you're saying I am a Medal of Honor winner.       So, you think that the wearing -       -- that the wearing of a military decoration that you haven't earned, that that's also of questionable consistency with the First Amendment?       No circumstances.     Where you go out in the street with the -- with the medal on you for everybody to see.       But the Government has said that's not how we read the statute.     And the courts read statutes to avoid a constitutional collision.     So, let's assume that we are not going to cover performances, satire.     It's just a bald-faced lie. That's all that this covers.       Suppose -- suppose the statute were amended, as has been proposed, to require an intent to obtain anything of value.       But that wouldn't -- that wouldn't reach this speaker.     Is that -- is that -- that wouldn't reach Alvarez because he didn't obtain anything of value.
11-246 +++$+++        But he didn't file it within the 30-day window, so that -- that is -- there was a clear track.     He could have filed within 30 days, and at least the government tells us that that would have been subject to judicial review, the ruling made within -- that nothing would go on until that action was cleared. So why -- if he could have sued early, before any title transfer, why isn't that all the relief someone in his position would be entitled to?     Why should he be allowed to wait? I mean, the whole purpose of the 30-day window is to get people to state their objections.       The government answers to that, that's in diversity.     You know, you determine citizenship as of the date the complaint is filed.     If the citizenship of a party changes, so it coincides with someone on the other side of -- of the line, it doesn't matter.     But do you have cases other than diversity cases where the filing of the complaint -- nothing happens, nothing that can happen after affects the jurisdiction as set as of the time the complaint is filed?     I don't know, outside diversity, where this principle has applied.       But I think the government told us that the land didn't belong to the tribe in the first place.       Well, the government did say that the Band was not the prior owner of the tract. So where would it go?       But didn't they -- wasn't -- didn't they have some encouragement from a court of appeals suggesting there might be a due process problem if they didn't have that notice?
11-262 +++$+++        But it's ambivalent.     I mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial.     We know what words were spoken.     Get to the trial; it turns out Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam. Then, end of trial, right?
11-338 +++$+++        But we didn't -       But that -- that is the question, the question of what the statute requires, was not decided below.       And you -- you're not urging that we reach it?       But if you were challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your adversary.     The format of this case now is we have -- we have Decker on one side and you on the other, and the EPA is not in the lawsuit.
11-345 +++$+++        Mr. Garre, could you explain -- I think you were trying to before -- what seems to me the critical question in this case:     Why didn't the 10 percent solution suffice?     There were a substantial number of minority members admitted as a result of the 10 percent solution.     Why wasn't that enough to achieve diversity?       Mr. Garre.     Mr. Garre.       Mr. Garre, before your time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved, that the gain is just too small to warrant using a racial criteria.       Once you have the percent, you don't need more.     So how do you answer the argument of the gain is too small?       But that's the same -- the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in some cases it's going to make a difference.     The same would be true under Grutter.     The same would be true under the policies now in existence at the military academies.
11-393 +++$+++        Mr. Kneedler, it's not a choice between someone else bringing the case and a law staying in place.     And what we're really talking about, as Justice Sotomayor started this discussion, is who is the proper party to take out what isn't infected by the Court's holding?     With all these provisions where there may be no standing, one institution clearly does have standing, and that's Congress. And if Congress doesn't want the provisions that are not infected to stand, Congress can take care of it. It's a question of which side -- should the Court say we're going to wreck the whole thing, or should the Court leave it to Congress?       You're relying on Congress's quite explicitly tying these three things together.       One of the points that Mr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable because the -- he spoke of the adverse selection problem, that there would be so fewer people in there, the insurance companies are going to have to raise the premiums. So, it's nice that Congress made it possible for more people to be covered, but the reality is they won't because they won't be able to afford the premium.
11-45 +++$+++        Mr. Feigin, those -- those statutes to which you refer said that no action on the claim -- well, this was Social Security benefits -- no action shall be brought under 1331.     There is no such provision here.       Can you go back and tell me when the government changed its position?     It was my understanding that up until, well, certainly this case was litigated, the government was taking the position MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the constitutionality of a statute. When did the government back away from that position?     When did it say, no, we were wrong; they do have jurisdiction?       Is there any such possibility in this case?     I mean, the statute says men must register for the draft.     There's no way to avoid -- to reread that statute to say anything other than that. So, I don't -- I don't see any constitutional avoidance.       Johnson v. Robison is one such case.     I don't recall in that case anybody referring to any administrative law treatise.       Do you know of any other -- any other case where an appellate court has authority to decide a question that the court of first instance lacked authority to decide?     I mean, you say MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that. I couldn't think of another case where a court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of first instance.       Where did -- where did Salfi go?     The agency couldn't decide the constitutional question.     So, what's the next stop?     Was it a court of appeals or the district court?       Yes.       Not on the constitutional question.       Why?     The district court is -- that's what it's equipped to do.     That's what it does all the time.     And --
11-460 +++$+++        Mr. Shah, what about the problem that one of the amici brought up concerning dredged material?     Said that if we just say Miccosukee applies, then when there's a dredging operation and the material is redeposited back into the same water, then that would also -- there would be no responsibility based on that.       And if there -- if there is --       Mr. Shah, am I right about that this other theory, if it were open to the Ninth Circuit, would apply equally to the other rivers that Justice Breyer mentioned, and those were out of the case because, when it got to the Ninth Circuit, we were talking about only the Los Angeles and the San Gabriel?       That -- that other theory would apply to all four.       But how do -- the district is a big contributor, but there are other contributors.     So, on your theory, how do we determine what is the share that the district would be liable for?       Well, would you still I'm not clear if you gave me an answer to how the district share would be determined.     It is not the only polluter.     Are you saying each permittee is responsible for the whole?       So how do we find out what is its part -- what is its share?       Thats because youre giving up -- you're giving up on the two rivers, even though your theory would work the same way with respect to them?       But do you think that the trial court was wrong, the district court was wrong, and the Ninth Circuit, both times, when they said, well, you didn't prove -- there was no -- there was no proof that the district was responsible for a given part.     So, on your theory, both the district court and the Ninth Circuit were wrong on that?
11-465 +++$+++        That would mean that if you prevail it would just become routine.     Justice Kennedy mentioned the stamp that says:     We considered all of the questions raised, those not discussed on the merits --       Was it fairly presented here?       Given that the argument was abuse of discretion?
11-551 +++$+++       You can't get it from Cherokee.    I mean, yes, there's Ferris, and then Cherokee --      -- is relying on Ferris. But Cherokee was very careful to point out that there were funds to cover the cost --       But you don't -- you don't have the obligation to perform.     I mean -- right? In a term of the contract, that their lack of sufficient appropriations, performance by either party is excused.      Mr. Phillips --      -- do I understand your position to be that, yes, the cap has meaning, because in order to exceed the cap, the tribe has to sue?    So, any tribe that sues, for any tribe that sues, the cap is meaningless?    It's only for the ones who are not sophisticated enough to sue.    They're just stuck with what Congress said. So it seems to me that would be a very bizarre scheme to set up that, that you have a cap, but the cap is meaningless if you bring a lawsuit.       My question is whether the cap was meaningless.     And I think your answer is, yes, for anyone who sues, the cap is meaningless.
11-556 +++$+++        Was that -- that question wasn't presented.     It was -- it was just assumed that -- that Silverman would qualify as a -- as a supervisor.       But why should that -- why should that matter?     I know you said that in your brief, Mr. Garre, if the -- if the alleged victim talked back. But in one of the very first cases that we had in this line, Harris v. Forklift, there was -- it was the boss, so there was no question about supervisor, and he was really making things hard for this employee; but, she was very firm, and she talked back to him. But, still, that's not what we said that counted.     We said, is she being subjected to terms and conditions of employment that she would not be subjected to but for her sex.       Mr. Ortiz said it wasn't just part-time.     He called my attention to the page before that says she also -- that Davis also directed --
11-564 +++$+++        What about, Mr. Blumberg, the government cited many, many pages in the record, I just took the first one, petition -- appendix to the petition, 104 and 105.     The court said, the officer and the dog were lawfully present at the defendant's front door, and we were told that that was conceded by you a number of times.       I thought you were talking about a dog trained to detect contraband --       -- not just any old dog.       Mr. Blumberg, the Florida appellate court, yes, the court of appeals, did say that that the officer and the dog were lawfully present.     But you say you didn't make that concession.
11-5683 +++$+++        But you have to draw a line someplace, and that's inevitable, that -- that some people are going to fall on one side.     But the point about the guidelines and the statute working together, wasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines - they wanted to do away with this distinction and Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do it to the statute?       But Congress did say Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines to applicable law.     The applicable law has got to be the new law, because if it were the old law, there's nothing to conform.     There's nothing that they need to change. It's only that this -- section A(ii) makes sense only if the applicable law is the new law.     Otherwise, the Commission doesn't have to do anything to achieve consistency.
11-597 +++$+++        What about -- Mr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's position on this temporary versus permanent?     It said -- she said that temporary versus permanent, the target should not be the Government's action, but the effect of that action; that is, if trees are killed and they weren't revived, the damage is permanent.     That's where we should vote, not whether the Government is going to do this year after year.       Mr. Kneedler, does your essential argument turn on this being indirect, as you say?     This is consequential; therefore, it isn't -- it doesn't belong in the takings category, anything that's consequential rather than direct?
11-626 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick, the city's position, it is whatever we want it to be.     That is the first time Lozman was sued by the city.     It was not under admiralty jurisdiction, it was a plain old landlord/tenant suit in State court, right?       Yes, well, my question is, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and just an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want it to be that way?       Well, let's take this very incident, that is he failed to comply with the revised rules and he was behind in his payment of dockage fees.     Could the city have brought that case in an ordinary State court for the arrears?       Why not?       What about --       Mr. Frederick, this is kind of an idiosyncratic case.     There are many cases I think in the courts now about floating casinos.     I take it on your definition the floating casino would be a vessel subject to maritime jurisdiction.       As long as the vessel stays in one place and the gambling goes on in one place, then it may be towed to a different location, and it stays there.     You -- you say because it is able to be moved from one place to another it qualifies as a vessel?
11-681 +++$+++ 
11-697 +++$+++        Mr. Rosenkranz told us that under this title means different things in other sections, and he gave a number of examples.       Mr. Olson, do you have an answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that if you read the statute as you are urging, then you are inviting the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs?       Mr. Stewart, may I ask you a preliminary question?     In Quality King the government took the position that the Petitioner is taking here.     What led the government to change its mind?     Was it just what has been called "dictum" in Quality King, or is there another reason why the government has switched sides?
11-702 +++$+++        Do -- do you agree with Mr. Goldstein when he says, in reality, it's not an affirmative defense, that the defendant never has to prove the amount?       Are there any other consequences?     We've been talking only about dispensation from removal.     But are there any other consequences that matter?
11-713 +++$+++        They denied summary judgment.     They didn't deny preclearance.       They denied summary judgment.       They did write in a -- in their summary judgment opinion, they made it sound like it's very complicated.       And so, that's why I'm -- I have some doubts about how swiftly they're going to render their decision after -- what is the date?     The trial will end on February 3rd?
11-770 +++$+++        And then Mr. Shanmugam says they could stop him.     They could stop anybody.     The search is ongoing.     Somebody approaches the house; the police can stop that person.       But --       Mr. Wall, the Summers case was an exception.     The main rule is you have probable cause.     So you are taking the exception, which was tied tightly to the house.     You want him to stay on the premises so he can -- there won't be any risk that he's going to disrupt the search, but it was -- it was an exception to the main Fourth Amendment rule, and now you are asking to have that exception spread. And so today you say, oh, well, we're not -- we're not asking if the person gets to her workplace, but that the police, but maybe why -- why not?     I mean, you -- it's one thing to confine Summers to the house, the immediate premises, and another to say seven-tenths of a mile away, that's okay, too.       You have to draw a line someplace.     When he is descending the steps to his house, he is still associated with the house.     And once he steps over that line, the Summers rationale it seems to me doesn't apply. But there's a curiosity about this case, maybe you can explain it to me.     They stop him seven-tenths of a mile away.     By that time, the search is ongoing.     They have found guns and contraband.     They take -- why do they take him back to the house?     What was the reason for taking?     There was nothing there that he could -- he couldn't obstruct the search.     He was in handcuffs.       He couldn't point out anything in drawers because they'd found it all.       Explain -- explain to me -- the police, they have the informant's tip, and they see them coming out of the house.     So it seems to me it's a good case that that would be reasonable suspicion.     Coming out of the house, he looks like what the informant says. Then they -- can they -- they pat him down and they find his keys, and the keys are to the house.       In this case, you couldn't think of a reason why they took him back to the scene.       They can follow him.
11-796 +++$+++        But he couldn't put the herbicide on -- he couldn't -- if he went and bought conventional seeds, not the genetically improved seeds --       -- then -- then he wouldn't -- what would the yield be if he puts the herbicide on it and they are all killed?
11-798 +++$+++        Would you clarify -- would you clarify what the -- what happens when there is an infraction?     Say three trucks.     Is it right that you can suspend until the infraction is cured, that you can suspend all of that operator's trucks?       But you could do the other.     See, I'm -- what -- what are -- is it -- is it just a matter of grace that you will say, well, we'll require them to fix those two trucks and all the others can travel?     Or could you say, until you fix those two trucks, none of your trucks come through?       Let's say it's a major violation.       And how about after it's corrected?     The government then says there's some uncertainty about that, whether you --
11-817 +++$+++        So -- so if the state doesn't keep -- if the state doesn't keep any performance records, then there would be no field performance to show, but that doesn't mean the state loses; is that what you're saying? The state doesn't keep performance records. The Florida Supreme Court seemed to say field performance records are required.       Are you conceding that the Florida Supreme Court, at least with respect to the field performance records, was wrong, that they -- it is not a Fourth Amendment requirement?       But they said it was part -- but they outline what the government must prove, and that was one of them.       Doesn't this -- this officer has been working with this dog for many months. They have training periods every week.     So why isn't that enough to show that this handler and this dog worked effectively as a team?       That's not what the Florida Supreme Court said?     It listed, along with training, that the -- the provision of records of field performance.       Suppose it's -- it's a dog that's just completed the training, training course, top-performing dog in the training program, but there's no field record.       The alert -- the alert here could have been to residual odor, or it could have been to drugs inside the pickup truck.     If it's -- because the alert was in front of the -- a front door handle, is that -- so it -- it's equally likely that it -- that it was just residual odor or that there were drugs inside the pickup truck. Can the police establish probable cause when what the dog alerted to may well have been residual odor and nothing inside?     The dog didn't alert anyplace other than the door handle, is that...       And if we think they were wrong in that respect, I suppose that you would say the Court shouldn't reverse, but should vacate and remand because the question did alert him to the door handle, was that enough?     Was that enough to establish probable cause that there were drugs in the vehicle?
11-820 +++$+++        Mr. Dreeben, Padilla itself was a collateral proceeding.     And if the state can argue in Padilla itself that a new rule was being sought and that that was permissible only on direct review, should the state have prevailed?       But this Court is a Federal court, so --       -- if your concern of Teague is comity, concern about -- the states running their own system, I understand the different  the state collateral and the Federal collateral view; but, if the idea of Teague is we don't want the Federal court to come in there and overlook what the state court did, why wouldn't that apply to this court reviewing a state court decision as much as it would apply to a Federal district court at a hearing habeas from a state conviction?       Well, do we know that that's true in Kentucky?       And this Court could not have raised it on its own?       Have we applied -- have we applied Teague to Federal convictions before?       It hasn't. And at least one important basis for the Teague rule is the comity to the state court system, which you don't have when the underlying conviction is a Federal conviction.       It was -- it was approved by the Judicial Conference in September.       Although you said you recognize that we have not had a Teague case involving a Federal conviction, I mean, there is lots of language in Teague cases about the Federal courts not interfering with state courts, that Teague was intended to minimize Federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings, to limit the authority of the Federal courts to overturn state convictions.     I mean, we have really pressed that -- that basis.
11-864 +++$+++        Mr. Barnett, this is on a different issue, but you had originally suggested that you had -- that the motion -- that the settlement that's looming was a reason that this Court ought not to decide this case.     But do you now agree that, given the district court's denial of your motion to enforce the settlement, that the proposed settlement has no bearing on this Court's consideration of the case?
11-88 +++$+++        How many judgments under -- I don't know whether it's Filartiga or Filartiga -- that -- that pattern, where the individual torturer is found in a U.S. jurisdiction?       There have been many judgments; how many have collected?       Well, wouldn't -- if Congress really wanted to have this, why wouldn't it include entity liability?     The corporation is likely to have more money than -- than an individual torturer.       What about the point that the immigration law takes care of that?     They wouldn't be able to get into the country.
11-889 +++$+++        Say that again, because we have a green brief that gives us samples of provisions for cross border.       Because there have been many, many -       Ms. Blatt, does Oklahoma law in any circumstance permit an appropriation of water -- water in Oklahoma for out-of-State use?       Just here and now, does Oklahoma ever -       -- permit out-of-State use of its water?
11-8976 +++$+++        Yes, but you recognize -- you recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question doesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense and the question is how do you allocate the proof burden? So your case accepts that there is a withdrawal defense.     Indeed, the judge gave a charge to the jury on -- so the contest, as I understand it, the difference between the two of you is you say, defendant can say, I withdrew.     If he does that, he has to prove it.     And the defendant is saying, I have to produce enough, so that a jury could find I withdrew, but you have the ultimate burden of persuasion.       Is this -- the burden allocation, is this a more hypothetical academic question?     I mean, you pointed out that you had ample evidence to show that he remained a member of the conspiracy. So does the allocation of burden of persuasion to the defendant versus proof of production to the defendant, persuasion to the government, does it really make much difference?     Does it have much practical consequence?
11-9307 +++$+++        Mr. Wall, why doesn't that describe this case?     In here is a statute, never mind Tapia, the statute says to the judge, don't lengthen the defendant's sentences for purposes of some cure.     And if the judge was not aware of that statute, he surely should have been, the prosecutor shouldn't -- wasn't it incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge, Judge, sorry, you can't do that?       But he was not aware of the statute.     No one called it to his attention.       Why -- why was it a Tapia claim?     Why wasn't it simply, trial -- trial judge, the statute says imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation?     Why weren't those -- why wasn't it really incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge, just read those words?       And what about what the rules -- what the rules advisory committee?     I mean, is it -- when 52(b) was put in the statute, they  they cited a case you cite in your brief, the Wiborg  or Wiborg case.     That wasn't, at the time, error.     It was a sufficiency-of-the-evidence error, the kind of thing you would expect the counsel to bring to the attention of the Court. And nonetheless, the -- the advisory committee put it in as an example of how 52(b) should operate.     And why?     They said they put it in there because it was a matter vital to the defendant. So the objection wasn't made, so the contemporaneous objection rule was -- was not observed and nonetheless, the Court said, We are going to take -- we are going to consider it on appeal because the matter is vital to the defendant. I can't imagine anything more vital than being deprived of 19 to 27 months of freedom.       Mr. Wall, your time is up, but we have a rule -- the Supreme Court has a rule -- and I would like to know how the government reads it.     It's our Rule 24, that says we, this Court, may consider plain error not covered in the questions presented, but evident from the record. Is our rule -- in your view, must the error be plain at the trial court stage, or is it enough that the error was plain at the court of appeals stage for us to apply our rule?
11-9335 +++$+++        But let's say --       How about in deference to the jury's finding?     I mean, in this -- this -- this very case, wasn't it so that the judge said, I could just say seven years because it's within the range, but it would be dishonest of me to do that, wouldn't it?     I have to say seven because it's the mandatory minimum. I think this is a case where the effect is -- is shown graphically, that the judge says, I'm stuck with the seven; I would prefer five.     That's what the jury would lead me to do, but I'm -- my hands are tied, I cannot respect the jury's finding.
11-94 +++$+++        Mr. Dreeben, I think the reference -- it was a fleeting reference to fines, and it could have meant that the judge has discretion to set the fine up to the maximum in the statute.     That's one possible meaning.
11-9540 +++$+++        But breaking and entering -- in your brief as I understand it you are not relying on the prosecutor's charge that there was breaking and entering.     You're relying entirely on the plea colloquy.     And in this plea colloquy, the prosecutor said, he broke and entered a grocery store. He says nothing.     In the typical Rule 11 setting, when the judge goes through the series of questions, the judge doesn't take the defendant's silence.     The defendant has to positively affirm.     And here we have a plea colloquy where the prosecutor says something and the defendant doesn't respond. Why is that any kind of a necessary admission when he said nothing, which he might have done under the impression that it didn't matter because he had the intent to commit a crime?       Why should it be different than in the Rule 11 colloquy?     Why shouldn't there be -- if -- if this is going to determine whether there's a crime qualifying under ACCA, why should it be enough that the prosecutor said something?     Why shouldn't the defendant have to say, yes, I broke and entered the grocery store?       Is that --       -- to charge it as what? What's shoplifting?       But it -- but it does come under this section 459.
11-965 +++$+++        So if a Mercedes Benz vehicle overturned in Poland and injured the Polish driver and passenger, suit for the design defect could be brought in California?       What was -- what was the year of that decision?       Yes, but the thinking about jurisdiction has changed enormously since then.       If there was ever an example of a corporation being at home in a particular place, it's Perkins against Benguet.     It was a Philippine company that was shut down entirely.     It was World War II.     To the extent the company was operating at all, it was in Ohio. It was not able to operate in what otherwise would have been its home base, so everything that the corporation was doing occurred in Ohio.       Well, but -- but why should we -- now that the Federal claims are out -- I mean, when you started the suit, you had a claim under the Alien Tort Statute, you had a claim under the Torture Victims Protection Act, but now, those Federal claims are out, and we are left with a claim under California law and Argentinian law. Why should a Federal forum exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims once the Federal claims are out of the picture?       Wouldn't it be arbitrary for it to exercise personal jurisdiction when there is no Federal claim and the case involves foreign plaintiffs injured abroad, allegedly due to the activities of a subsidiary operating abroad?       Yes, but that test that you just -- the sufficiently purposeful availing, those are all specific jurisdiction questions.       And not general jurisdiction questions.       And Goodyear distinguished the two by saying general jurisdiction means it's equivalent to residence for an individual. It's where you are at home. The -- and general jurisdiction was much broader in the days before long-arm statutes.     But now that we have specific jurisdiction, so you can sue where the event occurred, just as specific jurisdiction has expanded, so general jurisdiction has shrunk.       Well, any claim arising anyplace in the world.       But if you go -- if you go back to the -- to the foundation case of International Shoe, that case recognized that you can be an agent for one purpose, but not for another.     So the people -- the salesmen who were promoting the sales of shoes were the agents of International Shoe for the purpose of promoting the sale of shoes.     They were not an all-purpose agent for the purpose of, say, dealing - real estate dealings on behalf of the corporation. So you could have an agency for one purpose, selling cars in California, but totally unrelated to torturing people in Argentina.       What is -- what is the additional thing?       You did say, in your brief, that recognizing that other nations are highly critical of our expansive -- at one-time expansive notion of doing business as a basis for general jurisdiction, you say that that shouldn't be taken into account as a basis for constitutional decisionmaking. And yet, what we are talking about is a notion of whether it's fair and reasonable to require a corporation to answer in a forum and is -- is what the other countries think unenlightening on what's fair and reasonable?       Isn't that exactly what Goodyear held?       Well, there would hardly be room for a decision next to Goodyear that says, oh, for general jurisdiction purposes, it's enough that you have some subsidiary operating in the State.     The whole idea of Goodyear was to say, there is one place you can always sue a corporation, one or two, place of incorporation, a place -- principal place of business.       But people can be only one place at a time.
11-982 +++$+++        Mr. Goldstein, how the case came to us -- how this case originated was a counterclaim.       And at the time the counterclaim was asserted, there was certainly Article III jurisdiction over the counterclaim, right?       So it's -- so it's a question of -- of deficiency in their pleading.     Suppose they amended that counterclaim and said, as soon as we are able, we want to do a counterfeit.       Why?     Why?     I know you said that in your brief, but if you give it -- yes, if you -- if you say the -- the whole world can copy it, but this covenant would give it to only one manufacturer.       So why would you abandon -- why would giving a covenant to Already amount to abandonment of your mark?       Mr. Goldstein, can you inform us of when this practice of the unilateral covenant in order to moot a -- a cancellation claim, when -- how long has it been around?       Mr. Goldstein, what about Federal Rule 41(a)(2)?     It says, if the defendant has pleaded a counterclaim -- and you have recognized that there was Article III jurisdiction over that counterclaim -- the case may be dismissed on the plaintiff's request over the defendant's objection, only if the counterclaim can remain pending for independent adjudication.       So on the face of it, it seems that this -- that that rule fits this case to a T; that is, the -- plaintiff wants the case withdrawn, defendant objects, and the question is can the counterclaim remain pending for independent adjudication.       May I interject just one thing that I would like you to clarify?     Justice Breyer started out by saying the standard comes from Friends of the Earth.     Do you agree?     Because, as I recall, your brief doesn't -- doesn't even cite Friends of the Earth.
11-9953 +++$+++        How -- on that, how could it possibly be Lorenzi's fault, which is what you said is your first point, when he said, pay me, Supreme Court of Louisiana, you have said that my operation as counsel for this indigent defendant doesn't become operative till I get paid, I have a right to get paid. All that counsel did was to say, again and again, pay me, get the funds to pay me.     I don't understand how in the world it could be the fault of an attorney who has not gotten one cent from the State, has a right to be paid before he engages in representation -- how can it be his fault?       Mr. Boyer was -- had a limited education and a low IQ.     Did anyone ever counsel him about this, no, you don't have to have two lawyers, you can have one?     Did any judge ever tell him what his rights were?       What was the level of his education?       And he was expected to know all this about two counsel -- you have a right to two counsel, but, if the State isn't going to pay them, you can go forward with one counsel? Did anyone ever tell this man, with an eighth grade education, what his rights were?       And she was not -- you know, you said that, at all times, he had at least two. It seemed to me -- two paid counsel.     Lorenzi wasn't paid, so it was -- was it Singer?       And then the woman -- Lehman, is it?     But, when she started representing him, she didn't have the qualifications to be counsel.       But she wouldn't -- she couldn't be appointed counsel in a death case under Louisiana's rules.       Yes, but, in the very beginning, she wasn't even qualified to do that.       The -- the court itself said, repeatedly, that the cause of the delay was the funding crisis, the court -- I think we have to accept that as being the case, that the funding crisis -- the effort to get this lawyer paid failed, time and again. And it was the court determination that it is the funding crisis that caused the delay.
12-10 +++$+++        Are you -- what -- are you saying that you can -- within the government program, within the government program, the government can specify whatever it wants, including this -- this policy, but it can't then say, and the organization outside the program is also bound by this profession?
12-1036 +++$+++       In this particular case, the individual claims were settled in the class action, so if there -- if there are no individual claimants to be -- to be represented, why doesn't this end up being a claim where only the State of Mississippi has a stake, because the individuals that the State might have been representing have already been satisfied, so if this is -      That seems to be -- that seems to be disputed, because I understood Mr. Massey to say that the restitution claim would go to the State. And you say that that -- the restitution couldn't go to the State.      Maybe they didn't, but if you look at the committee report, what is the definition of mass action?    And it is, under this new subsection D-11, "expands jurisdiction over suits that are brought on behalf of numerous -- numerous -- named plaintiffs." "Numerous named plaintiffs."
12-1038 +++$+++    Flower -- Flower was with the street.   On your Flowers point, I think Mr. Horwich said that -- that there was no doubt that 1382 applied. It was only a constitutional guestion --   -- in Flowers.   But the -- but the barment order that Mr. Horwich just read to us says that he can use the road, but that's not -- because the road is outside the statute, that's because the government, as a matter of grace, said right in the order, right in the bar order, you can use the road. So there's a sharp difference. The government says the road is under military control, if the commander so chooses, but we're going to let him use the road. The government treats the -- the domain as including the road, as including this protest area.
12-10882 +++$+++    Can I stop you there?   I thought that you don't have to go to, under your view, you don't have to go to the second and third standards if you -- on the first, it's 70 or below. I thought that adaptive behavior doesn't come into the picture, and onset doesn't come into the picture, if the IQ is above 70.   How many States retain that practice with a rigid 70 cutoff?
12-1117 +++$+++    What do you say clearly establishes that? You -- you say the passenger is there. What case tells a police officer when there is a passenger no lethal weapon?   What about the statement that there was a police manual that says once you authorize to shoot, you can continue shooting until the job is done?
12-1128 +++$+++       How about a permissive counterclaim?      How about a permissive counterclaim?      But could -- could the patentholder bring in the declaratory action a counterclaim for infringement?      But that was not -- Weast was not -- was not a patent infringement case.    It wasn't a declaratory -- it wasn't a declaratory judgment, was it?      Why -- why isn't that true here?    Because you are seeking release of the escrowed funds.      You cite -- you cite the default rule and you rely on that totally.    But there are other rules on burden of proof, for example, the party who has better access to the information.    So it's not as though there is this firm rule with no exceptions. I take it from your answers to Justice Scalia that you are saying in every declaratory judgment action where only one party is seeking relief, that party has the burden of proof.    So you're not limiting this to patent cases; is that right?
12-1146 +++$+++    One of the things that EPA said in -- in the explanation of this rule is that EPA could say that PSD or Title V applies only to certain GHG sources -- it's been suggested that that source would be carbon dioxide -- applies only to certain GHG sources and does not apply to the remaining GHG sources. But there didn't seem to be any follow-up on that idea. Well, the way to cure it is carbon dioxide doesn't work, take it out.   There's a difference between them.   So which one? Either one of them?   Well, what -- what about BACT for C02, then?   Well, wouldn't the proper answer be if we are rejecting your entire position to say there are these other options? We're not going to say take out C02. We're not going to say adopt the Kavanaugh approach. We're going to say those are choices for EPA to make.   Well, how did the EPA come at -- settle on the number?
12-1163 +++$+++    Two of the items that you mentioned, one was venue, and the other was claim preclusion, issue preclusion, the Federal Circuit is no more expert in those areas than a district court would be.   The  you mentioned the venue question.   And I was surprised. The Court said, well, that's for the Pennsylvania court to sanction.   But you, I'm sure, have read Noxell case in the D.C Circuit --   -- one of the problems there, one of the conduct that was considered unreasonable was suing in -- in a distant forum, very far from where the defendants operated. And claim preclusion and issue preclusion come up in all kinds of cases, so there's nothing expert about the Federal Circuit on those issues.
12-1168 +++$+++    That was an injunction.
12-1173 +++$+++    Mr. Yang, would you clarify what you're -- what Mr. Lechner told us. He said that to this very day the Department of Interior has taken the position that these railroad rights of way are easements.   What would  what would be the exposure of the United States if we -- if you lose- are there takings claims now?
12-1182 +++$+++    And that's because because EPA did it that way -- you don't get that from the statute. You get it from what EPA did in the first round; is that right?
12-1184 +++$+++    If the Court is dealing with the Federal Circuit's test and it's got these two things, baseless and --   -- subjectively, and clear and convincing evidence, I think to leave out that piece of it when it all comes out of that one paragraph in the Brooks Furniture case, so I think once the case is before us, if we leave out that one piece --   Well, why don't why don't we just take -- there's another statute, as you know, that has identical wording, the Lanham Act, and that says exceptional means not run of the mine, uncommon. And then there's a nice illustration, a case from the D.C Circuit.   Why don't we say, Well, we have it there in the Lanham Act, the same words.   But you just look to   You look to the text   -- and the text is identical in both. The legislative history, some people like it, some people don't. But the text is identical. So I think it would be odd to construe the very same words in the context of the Lanham Act one way and a different way in the context of the Patent Act.   What about the inherent authority -- Justice Kagan brought this up -- not just Rule 11, but inherent authority when the court finds that the litigation is baseless and brought in bad faith? It seems to me that your standard is the same as what the Court could do without any statute. Are there other pieces --
12-1200 +++$+++    But she did say that EBIA had the burden to demonstrate error in the bankruptcy courts.
12-123 +++$+++        Mr. Palmore, am I incorrect in thinking that the government is saying, handlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the Raisin Marketing Order?     You've told us that the producers can go to the Court of Claims.     What about the handlers?     They're at least being fined for violating the Act, and it's their position that the whole thing is unconstitutional. Can they raise the constitutionality of the whole arrangement defensively, or they simply can't raise the constitutionality of the Act?       But it would be --
12-126 +++$+++        Before you proceed with that, can you address Justice Alito's point that the district court said there is no merit to this; it's not an actual innocence -- it's not a valid actual innocence claim.     And then the Sixth Circuit sends it back for the district court to decide something it's already decided? How do you overcome that the Sixth Circuit never reviewed the actual innocence question, the district court did and said this doesn't make it?       And the statute of limitations would run from the discovery of the new evidence, not from --       You have a larger -- you have a larger category, you say miscarriage of justice, so one is actual innocence.     You say the category is well defined.     So what else would fit under this -- and we can bring it up very late in the -- in the day. Anything else other than actual innocence would be in this category?       How about --       The Second Circuit -- when it had a similar case, the Second Circuit itself said that actual innocence is rare.     This is such a case.     This is a case where the alibi that he had was -- it was established by forensic evidence, air-tight, he was someplace else.     The -- the Second Circuit didn't send it to the district court to decide the actual innocence. It decided that itself and then said, district court, now you deal with the -- with the questions that the petitioner is raising -- the constitutional questions.     But the Sixth Circuit just seemed to be -- it didn't matter whether -- it didn't matter whether the actual innocence claim had any solid basis, when they sent it back to the district court. Shouldn't -- if there is an actual innocence gateway, shouldn't the court of appeals determine that before it returns the case to the district court?       Yes, but it didn't find anything about whether this was -- this claim was -- was a good one.       And I'm still puzzled about what happens next.     The case goes back to the district court and the -- the district court is told, diligence doesn't matter.     The district court says, yes, but I thought -- I thought that the claim was worthless.
12-1281 +++$+++    But your argument would destroy the recess clause. There would be -- under your argument, it is totally -- totally within the hands of the Senate to abolish any and all recess appointments.   Suppose -- suppose we have an inter-session break. It's three days. On your reading of the Recess Clause, in that three days, the President can fill up vacancies.   Well, leave out the second question. Just on -- the first question, because it seems to me that if the rationale was when Congress was out of town for 6, 9 months, of course, the President has to be able to make the government work. But now you're saying that in that time, it's only three days, they are going to be there available very soon to confirm. And let's say somebody -- somebody dies on day 1. The President puts in -- makes an appointment on day 2. You would say that's okay?   If there is a 3-day recess between sessions, then your argument is that is -- that is a recess and the President can make -- can make appointments in that time.
12-1315 +++$+++    Mr. Perry, you said that the -- the objective is to get the copyright holder to sue early on and not to wait, but if the -- if no profits had been made in that early period and it would cost the plaintiff more to mount a lawsuit than the plaintiff could possibly receive in damages, why shouldn't the plaintiff, who has a copyright that's going to run a long, long time, sue? If things stay the same, no suit will ever be brought. Why is it unreasonable for the plaintiff to see if the copyright is worth anything?   Why should it be different from the patent case?   So you think the Federal circuit's decisions are wrong?
12-133 +++$+++        Mr. Stewart, is it -- the arbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right?     They can't, or can they have -- they have the 12 similarly situated people, not a class, join in the arbitration, or is it one on one?       And even in the days before we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in Federal court you could have multiple plaintiffs joining together.
12-135 +++$+++        I thought that Oxford conceded that it did not preserve any question of entitlement to de novo review.       Why don't you, Mr. Katz, why don't you concentrate on what the arbitrator himself said?     Mr. Waxman said this clause wasn't unusual, but the arbitrator said, I've never seen anything like this.       Is the -- is the contract authorized it as for Dr. Sutter, all of the others are similarly situated, they got the same contracts?       So either the contract means what the arbitrator said it meant or it doesn't. If it means what the arbitrator said it meant, then everybody's bound.       And those -- and there are rules that governed that, right?       You would never have class action arbitration if that were so.       It would be impossible because you could never get in advance -- they find out that by getting notice and then they decide whether they want to stay with it or opt out.       How long -- can we straighten out this 11 years?     How many years was this in the New Jersey courts before there was ever an arbitrator appointed?       How many -- how -- what is the history of class actions and arbitrations?     There are at least enough of them so that the AAA has a set of rules about how you handle class arbitrations, right?
12-1371 +++$+++    So in your view, and I think you said this in your brief, but what constitutes violent conduct? So you said not scratching, not bruising, not slapping.   When I asked you the question, you -- you were hesitant about scratching, bruising, slapping.   But on you reading, it seems that one thing that Congress really wanted to cover, it didn't; that is, the -- the defendant has brutally beaten the mother of his child. But under the Tennessee statute, you would say that that doesn't qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.   So that means that on your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we know Congress wanted to cover.   Would it make any difference in your view if instead of domestic violence, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the statute said misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse?
12-138 +++$+++    Mr. Blackman, may I ask you, preliminarily, on your view, what happens next? That -- can this party -- and suppose you're right -- can the -- can the BG Group institute an action in Argentina and, if it's not resolved within 18 months, invoke arbitration?   And if it is resolved, but not to BG's liking then, thereto, BG can invoke arbitration?   Well, doesn't that mean that the treaty partners agreed that only an arbitration panel can conclusively resolve this dispute? Not a court.   I don't -- I don't get your answer to my question. Am I wrong in thinking that, under this treaty, the ultimate decisionmaker is the arbitrator. There is no provision for the court to be the ultimate arbiter of the controversy?   That's -- the D.C. Circuit treated this as there is no agreement until you go to the local court first.   The argument is that there is an agreement to arbitrate. That will be the method of dispute resolution. You have to take certain steps before. So you have to go to the local court. But why isn't the dispute settlement mechanism decided upon by the parties' arbitration, and then what you have to do before that is in the nature of a procedural condition?   Well, what would happen -- what would happen in this case if there was a judge's strike, so none of the courts were operating in Argentina? What would happen then?
12-1408 +++$+++    If it is treated for income tax purposes as wages, why shouldn't it be treated for FICA tax purposes?   What your are saying is on the income side they are treated as wages; on the FICA side they're not treated as wages.   There are some severance payments that do count for FICA purposes, isn't that so?   Could you review again, what is -- what is the relevant distinction between dismissal payments that are subject to FICA and payments that are not?   It has to be involuntary?   And SUB payments are all voluntary?   You  well, you told me that the dismissal payments are involuntary. How about the supplemental? Are they ever and always voluntary?
12-142 +++$+++        The failure -- the failure to warn defense was -- the -- the judge struck that out.     So there was no failure to warn defense in the case.       How do you respond to the argument, Mutual's argument that they have -- in 2005, they made -- this drug produced $7 million.     The jury verdict was 21 million.     They said that 3 years of their earnings wiped out.
12-144 +++$+++        General Verrilli, I could understand your argument if you were talking about the entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's only eight or nine States, the States that permit civil unions, and that's -- brings up a question that was asked before.     So a State that has made considerable progress has to go all the way, but at least the government's position is, if it has done -- the State has done absolutely nothing at all, then it's -- it can do -- do as it will.       Suppose -- suppose one of those States repeals its civil union laws?
12-1493 +++$+++    Mr. Palmore, when the Agency changed its view in 1994, there was no change in the statutory text, was there?   And at that time, the interpretation was that you committed the offense if you sold -- if the person, the true buyer, was an unlawful -- a person to whom firearms could not be sold. But if you -- if the ultimate possessor was a lawful possessor, then there was no liability. So the -- the statute has to be open, at least, to either interpretation, no change in the words. The Agency read it one way, and then later changed its mind and read it the other way.
12-158 +++$+++       General Verrilli, before your time is out, you haven't answered directly why the Bill of Rights does constrain the treaty power, the implementation of it, Reid v. Colbert?    Why is the Bill of Rights different from the federalism concern that the Court has expressed in many cases, when you say, yes, there is a check, the Bill of Rights is a check, but not the Tenth Amendment?
12-167 +++$+++        Mr. Yablon, the -- the case that you're presenting would be quite strong if the same judge -- if the magistrate judge also presided at the plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are special in this case.     One is it's a different judge, and two is we have the interval of some three months in between.     And then we have a plea hearing that looks to me like it's exemplary.     The district judge did go through everything that Rule 11 calls for. So it is a different case, isn't it, when we have a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no pressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the defendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode where a magistrate judge did overbear?       But -- but the -- but the judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your conduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy?     And the defendant answered yes.     And the -- the judge asked, has anyone pressured you to plead guilty?     And he answers no.     So -       Mr. Yablon, one problem with calling this structural error is that it's not so clear that this is a -- a bad thing.     That is, some States, even today, allow a judge to participate in plea bargaining, and the advisors -- the rules advisory committee -- said, when it -- when it framed this rule, that some commentators had said it was quite -- quite a frequent thing that happened, that judges participated. So it isn't like not having a public trial or not giving a person counsel of choice. It's, this was -- this was something that still some jurisdictions think it's okay.
12-17 +++$+++       But it has -- it has -       What else -- what else can Virginia do besides -- I don't know if there are    elks in Virginia, but besides -- to reserve for its own -- for its own people?    You say, this is -- good government in Virginia is for Virginians.    Big game hunting, scarce resource can be reserved for in-State people. What else can Virginia do?
12-207 +++$+++        I thought fingerprinting -- Mr. Shanmugam, I thought fingerprinting was used to determine whether they -- the person has a record.     We have this person, and now, we check the fingerprints to find out if he has a prior record, that's different from to find out if he has committed a crime that we don't know about. But -- but are fingerprints used to determine whether the person has a prior record?       When they're no longer in the custody of the State, does the government have to destroy it?     They served their time, and their privileges have been restored.
12-236 +++$+++        So are you saying that the good faith and the reasonableness go to two things: Page 29 One, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness.       You say the Special Master "may" award -- so it "may" award is discretionary.       Well, let's take -- let's take this case.     What would you put in to show that you have been reasonable, in good faith and reasonable, one, as to the claim; and two, as to the attorneys' fees? Page 34 What -- what would the Special Master have to look at to make those determinations in this case?
12-246 +++$+++        But isn't the most logical inference from the silence not that he isn't quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but that it would incriminate him if he answered?       But he could -- he could invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to one set of questions and not another, and what's disturbing me about your position, if it's -- if you have -- someone being interrogated, who is savvy, will say, "I plead the Fifth."     And somebody who is not that smart is just silent.     To make a difference between those two people on whether comment can be made on the failure to respond is troublesome.       You've -- you've said in your brief that there might be a whole other -- many other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he fears incrimination. But what -- what obvious other reasons unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, why a defendant might remain silent?     I mean, the Griffin rule is he doesn't have to say, I plead the Fifth, because we assume that, when he doesn't take the stand, he is doing so because he doesn't want to incriminate himself.       Okay.     But -- but I don't think you -- you were going to tell me this great deal of conduct, what silence could mean other than, I fear incrimination.     What else is -
12-25 +++$+++        Suppose you -- you said that you had a few people came and complained to the lawyers, and then the lawyers wanted to see how widespread this was.     Suppose the lawyer herself bought a car recently, and she got this administrative fee. And, now, she has -- no clients have approached her, but she would like to find out how many similarly situated people there are, so she can get one of these representative actions going. Could -- on that basis, would it be permissible to use -- would that come under the litigation exception?
12-3 +++$+++       Can an accountant be a contractor?      But then -- but the bottom line of your argument Mr. Perry, is that the whistleblower who is working for the accountant -- you say there are separate provisions that deal with the accounting firm and the law firm.    But the whistleblower who wants to disclose what nefarious thing is going on would have no protection against retaliation by the accounting firm or, if it's a law firm, the law firm?      But the answer to my question is right, they wouldn't have -      -- a whistleblower claim against the accounting firm or the law firm?      I'm sorry.    You told me that Congress didn't provide for the whistleblower, but it allowed the agency to do so.      Which agency?      Apparently, that's not the view of the SEC because I think they are -- they are represented by the government.    And the SEC apparently takes the view that this provision does cover contractors.    It covers lawyers who couldn't be contractors and accountants.      It's a lot like the dissent in the First Circuit.
12-307 +++$+++        Mr. Srinivasan --       But when the government -- when the -- when the case is adjudicated in the first instance -- we're talking here about appellate authority.       The government sometimes loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't appeal.     If it agrees with the result that the court reached, it doesn't appeal and then the judgment in the first instance where there was adversity is -- is the last word.     So when does the government decide, yes, we agree with the -- the adjudication in the court of first instance and so we'll leave it there?     And when does it say, yes, we agree, but we want higher authority to participate?       How many States have civil unions now?       And how many had it in ?
12-315 +++$+++    Can we go back to the "who decides" guestion? I find it very confusing. Now, everybody seems to say, well, it's the jury that decided -- that decides, but the Colorado supreme court said that it recognized that the court was to decide this guestion, not the jury. And in this case, the jury decided it. That was error, the Colorado supreme court said, but it was harmless. So who decides? Is it -- is it the court or the jury?   What are -- what are the factual issues? You said the factual issues. I didn't think that there was much dispute about what was said to the air traffic safety. So what are -- what are the disputed facts that the jury would find relevant to the 4 immunity?   Well, they didn't -- they said, we were concerned about his mental stability.   How do you add to the guestion -- the guestion in this case was put by the Court -- the guestion whether ATSA immunity may be denied without a determination the air carrier's disclosure was material and false?
12-357 +++$+++        How was it -- could you tell us a little more?     How was it taken?
12-398 +++$+++        Do you concede -       Do you concede at least that the decision in the Federal Circuit, that Judge Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is the Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too?     That is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments did not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that wrong.       Even though -- even though the government has disavowed it, even though the government, representing the United States -       At least that the strength of the presumption would be diluted.
12-399 +++$+++        But I think Justice Breyer is quite wrong because a standard that says results in serious emotional or physical damage to the child is far from a best interest standard.       I thought the definition of an Indian child is just straight out of the statute. An Indian child is someone who is either a member of a tribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.       I thought that there's some ambiguity there because one reason why he wanted to marry was that he would get more pay and allowances.       He would be out under South Carolina law because he didn't support the child during the pregnancy.       Termination of parental rights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent, which is quite -       But the whole thrust of it, you -- this is directed to providing remedial services, which it -- it seems that it fits a situation where someone has custody but is having problems getting his or her act together so needs the help of a social worker, but it makes no sense to talk about remedial services for someone who has never had custody.
12-414 +++$+++        May I ask you, Ms. Newman, if you would agree that the Sixth Circuit was wrong, at least to this extent, is there -- what is the argument for directing a prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never previously made?     The offer that was made is impossible to carry out now.     The offer was conditioned on her testimony at her aunt's trial.     That didn't happen. So there is no -- there is no plea bargain offered.     And yet, the court instructs a renewal, instructs the prosecutor to renew an offer that doesn't exist.       Then how could -- how could this Court order the prosecutor to renew an offer that can't be made?       But the whole -- what drove the prosecutor to make this bargain was he wanted the testimony, so how -- how can that -- that's -- I've never seen anything like this, where a court orders a prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never made.       But the charge was - that she was convicted of second-degree murder, right?
12-416 +++$+++        What about the consideration that seems to be driving the government? That is, the generic is getting an offer that they would never get on the street.     I mean, they are being paid much more than they would get if they won the patent infringement suit. If they won the patent infringement suit, then they can sell their generic in competition with the brand.     But under this agreement they get more than they would get by winning the lawsuit.       I thought the government was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it wanted to and sold its drug.       Well, what was the change that was made?
12-417 +++$+++       Mr. DINardo, in this case, does it matter if we take your position that anything you need to wear to be ready for work or the government's position -- and I think it was the Seventh Circuit's position, too -- that equipment is different from clothes?    But here the Seventh Circuit said the equipment that's involved, hard hats, glasses, earplugs, respirator, none of those things -- that they -- they take de minimis time, so we don't have to worry about them. In this case, will it make a difference if we go your way and say, everything worn counts; or the government's way saying, well, that these clothes count, but equipment can be distinguished?
12-418 +++$+++ 
12-43 +++$+++        I thought you would -- you would answer that, that the Commissioner gets some credit, too.     This is the Commissioner -- this is a Treasury regulation.     So one question is:     Do we owe that regulation any kind of -- any kind of deference?       Ms. O'Connell -- if the Court should go the way the Fifth Circuit went -- the way the Tax Court went -- could the regulation be changed so it wouldn't happen again?
12-462 +++$+++    In Wolens -- and this is a case that you rely on and that allowed room for contract claims -- the expression was "self-imposed undertaking." And the airline says, we didn't impose, we didn't take on this obligation, but the law reads it into every contract, whether we want it or not. How is it self-imposed if the party has no say, that it's going to apply anyway?   Suppose the supreme court of the State had an opinion that says, we're going to be candid about this, the covenant of fair dealing and good faith, it's not in this contract, but we will read it into every contract; that is, if the State supreme court said, it's externally imposed, this is a rule that we will read into every contract because of the policy in our State that people should deal with each other fairly. Suppose that was the controlling decision of the Minnesota supreme court. Then you're out; is that right?   Well, it's one thing to read the terms in the agreement. It's another thing to say it's an underlying premise that good faith and fair dealing will control. Are you taking issue with the good faith and fair dealings standard being amorphous, being susceptible to different interpretations by different judges, by different juries?   Is an employment at-will contract illusory?   That's because the contract was silent. Here, it isn't. Here, the contract, says "sole discretion." In Wolens, the guestion was retroactivity, and the contract said nothing one way or the other about it.   The plaintiff --   And the plaintiff used the freguent flyer program, whatever else it might be used for, he used it to get lower prices on flights, right?   Your point is that you can get freguent flyer miles by purchases other than airplane transportation.
12-464 +++$+++        On that point, Mr. Dreeben, would you clarify what happens at the end of the road, if the defendant is convicted?     I think you said, in theory, you could go after the lawyers to recoup the fee, but that would be difficult. Can you explain what is the difficulty?     We know how much the fee was.
12-484 +++$+++        But your alternate argument would -- would involve two standards, the one that Congress provided for substantive discrimination, the -- the improvement on -- on Price Waterhouse and then for retaliation, Price Waterhouse.       And I started this -- this argument by asking, is there -- in the realm of anti-discrimination law, is there any example where you have the -- the substantive charge governed by one standard and retaliation by another?
12-515 +++$+++    You agree with that, that they could -- the State could go in and arrest all the customers that are gambling there? Could it seize the slot machines?   What would be the big -- what would be the big change, other than modifying Kiowa, which is a divided opinion, and was dealing with a money claim. It wasn't dealing with injunctive relief.   But - Mr. Katyal, is that right? The distinction between commercial and governmental, it was court made in the first instance, and then the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act codified law that was court made. So it was the courts that made the distinction between acting in a commercial capacity and acting in a governmental capacity.   Mr. Katyal, isn't it odd to say that when this is the Court -- the doctrine of tribal immunity is something that was announced by this Court. Congress never passed a law that said the tribes have immunity. It's all this Court. And then you say, what this Court made, only Congress can unmake. That seems strange to me.   Dependent sovereigns.   Justice Alito's question was the Kiowa case. It was off reservation, the tribe owed money on a contract, which it refused to pay, and the Court said sovereign immunity.   Mr. Kneedler, you went through the development of the foreign sovereign immunity and whether the courts were influenced by the government. It was the courts that recognized this distinction between commercial activity and governmental activity. Why couldn't the Court extend that same distinction to Indian tribes and say, it makes sense in the foreign country context, it also makes sense in the context of the tribes, to distinguish commercial from governmental?
12-5196 +++$+++    I thought the objection had to be raised by a creditor within a certain time.   I thought -- isn't there a provision that says, and if there's no objection, the exemption is what is claimed?   Maybe you get it from the trustee.   The faithless trustee.   Ms. Harrington, at the cert stage in this case, the Government suggested the distinction between two situations: One, an action by the debtor to remove property from the estate, leaving the creditors unsatisfied. And that's where you say this power of exemption can be taken away. And then the other side was where the creditors are paid in full and only the trustee's litigation expenses are at issue. Are you dropping that distinction?
12-52 +++$+++ 
12-536 +++$+++        General Verrilli, the Government in the proceeding below didn't suggest in response to the -- to the proceedings before the three-judge court that an evidentiary hearing was - both sides seem to treat this as a matter that could be disposed of without an evidentiary hearing; is that right?       There's the point that the Chief made about what this does is limit particularly on the national strategy.     It drives contributions towards the PACs and away from the parties, that money -- without these limits, the money would flow to the candidate, to the party organization, but now, instead, it's going to the PACs. What is your response to that?
12-547 +++$+++        I think the question that was asked was, as a bottom line, at the end of the day -       -- did anybody get sentenced less?     Did it affect the outcome?     You gave a case where a defendant was allowed to raise diminished capacity, but was -- are there cases where the defense was successful on the merits?       But this -- the case is -- is very different from Bouie, which you -- which you rely on.     In -- in Bouie, it was the question of a rule that is governing conduct.     People come on to premises; they have no reason to think that they are committing an offense if they don't leave when somebody asks them to if they came onto the premise lawfully. So what the Court said in Bouie was that this is a regulation of primary conduct, and, at the time these people acted, they had no reason to believe that what they did was unlawful.     That's quite a different -       It -- it isn't subjective reliance; it's -- it's what was the law.       And the Court said that the State supreme court interpretation of the statute was quite a surprise.
12-562 +++$+++        Mr. Garre, suppose the government had asserted this penalty under sub (6), or the transaction lacking economic substance.     Would you be -- would you say it doesn't make any difference, it's the same?     Or would you say that, under (6), your argument is not applicable to that and the determination could be made at the partnership level?       So just to be clear, if this is -- 6 had been on the books, then you would have no quarrel with the Government's position, they could do this at the partnership level and -
12-574 +++$+++       Mr. Goldstein, can I take you back to the origins of all of this?      The main move for personal jurisdiction traditionally is the plaintiff must go to where the defendant is, no matter how inconvenient that is for the plaintiff.    Jurisdiction is defendant-centered.    You're trying to hold a defendant, you have to go where he is. Then the long arm age comes about, and we have specific jurisdiction, which, by the way, is what you're urging.      You're still not saying they have all-purpose jurisdiction over Walden.      And this Court, as the MCEntyre decision indicates, has been pretty careful about specific jurisdiction.    And Miguel wasn't enough that machine blew up or cut somebody's fingers in New Jersey.    They had to purposely avail themselves of wherever the -- the standard words are. And here you're asking for -- really pushing this specific jurisdiction to the limit.    The defendant has acted only in Georgia.    He hasn't set foot outside the State.      But you are asking the Court to decide a big ticket item, personal jurisdiction, and the theory that you are proposing would apply not to, just to Officer Walden, but it would be about as far out as any specific jurisdiction case I know.    So the Court shouldn't say, well, jurisdiction okay; venue, okay, but consider it transferring it to Georgia.    That seems to me wild.      Did Calder have something to do with the notion that every defamation is -- that every publication is a tort where it occurs?    There is something special about the libel cases.    There was that theory that wherever the paper that contains the libelous article, wherever it is sent, in each one of those places the tort occurs there.      Except, Mr. Goldstein -      -- it -- it is of no consequence to Walden whether this person is from Alaska or Nevada.    In Calder, the article was about a person in California.    The sources came from California.    The paper had its principal circulation in California.    It seems to me there's nothing resembling that in this case.
12-609 +++$+++        Mr.     Katyal, if this had played out entirely in the Federal court, the examination of the defendant was pursuant to Federal Rule 12.2.     Your argument seems to be that Rule 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment.     I mean, the mental examination was ordered in the Federal court after the defendant said, I am going to put on a couple of witnesses -- expert witnesses, to testify to my mental state. Rule 12.2 says, when a defendant does that, then the government has the right to have the defendant examined by its expert.     So the broad argument that you're making seems to lead inevitably to the conclusion that Rule 12.2 is unconstitutional.       But this -       But the scope question wasn't decided by the Kansas court, and they wouldn't get to it, unless they held that, yes, you can have this rebuttal testimony.     Then the next question is, if you can have it, how far it can go? But the anterior question, can you have it at all, is the question the Kansas Supreme Court answered, no, you cannot have it.     And we can't send it back to them without -- I mean, if -- if you can't have it at all, then it's irrelevant that the scope was too broad.       Mr.     Katyal, would you - you said, in answer to my question, that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2 violates the Fifth Amendment in small part.     Can you be explicit?     The rule, as I understand it, says if the defendant is going to introduce evidence concerning his mental state, then the government has a right to have the government's expert examine the defendant and rebut what the defendant's experts say. That's what the rule is.     And then it says, you can't go beyond the scope of that issue -- of the mental state.       You think it's unconstitutional to say to the defendant, you have a choice; if you introduce this testimony, then the government can follow where you have led; if you don't introduce the testimony, then of course, the government has nothing to rebut?       Yes.       It says, "on which the defendant has introduced evidence."     The evidence is the defendant's expert.       Mr. Katyal, if that's your position, then you must disagree with the D.C. Circuit decision, which was already mentioned, United States against Byers, which took the position that, where the defendant leads, the government may follow. For the very reason that the defense expert has access to the defendant, you can't disarm the government by saying, we're not going to let you have a counter-expert.     All you can do is cross-examine the defendant's expert.       I didn't know that it was policy.     I thought it was -- it was saying it is just like the defendant gets on the stand; he's subject to cross-examination.     The defendant puts on experts; the government must be treated equally, must be able to put on its own experts. And as far as waiver, that's a fiction, isn't it?     The defendant could say, 100 times, I'm going to testify, but I'm not waiving my Fifth Amendment privilege.     It wouldn't matter if he said that 100 times.     He will be exposed to cross-examination.       Mr. Katyal, you have conceded, I think, in response to Justice Alito's question, that the rules could be changed to say, defendant, you cannot put on these experts.     So how does that maybe help defendants who want to put on a defense of mental state?     You can't put it on, unless the government can put it on.     That's the current rule. But you're saying the response to it can be this evidence is shut out entirely.     The government - the government will have nothing to answer if the defendant doesn't put on experts.     I'm not so sure that would be a rule that defense counsel would put on.       What do you need to hammer out?     You said that the rule now is no good because it allows government psychiatrists to have access to the defendant -- compelled access.     That rule is no good, but the alternative of not allowing this evidence at all, what is there to hammer out?       Is there really a huge difference between mental state as an element of the defense and mental state as an affirmative defense?     I mean, in reality, doesn't -- doesn't the mental state argument of the defendant function as an affirmative defense to premeditated murder? Government has the burden of proof on mental state, but it -- it operates, as far as a defendant is concerned, if the defendant is able to show this voluntary intoxication, that would be a defense to premeditated murder.
12-62 +++$+++        This is a change -- your position is -- is a change, at least in the position that the government took in -- in the Seventh Circuit case that started all this.     The government confessed error. The government said the district judge should have used the guidelines that were in effect at the time the offense was committed, and the government came to the Seventh Circuit and confessed error. So there was not even an argument until the Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner wrote the opinion that included all the hypotheticals that -- that were aired earlier about the victim impact statement and all of those are in that opinion.     So it was only after -- after the Seventh Circuit opinion that the government changed its position.       The guidelines range gets a presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level.       Do you disagree with -- getting back to what this case is about, the D.C. Circuit, in opposition to the Seventh Circuit said, it is enough that using the new guideline created a substantial risk that the defendant's sentence was more severe than it would have been if the guidelines in effect at the time of the crime were used. And is it -- there is no doubt that this case fits that description.     There was quite a substantial risk that the elevated guidelines would result in a more severe sentence.       He's saying that -- the question is which guidelines in this case?     And he's saying it's the guidelines in effect at the time he committed the crime.     We are not dealing with other -- I mean, it's quite a simple choice. Is it -- does the court start with the guidelines in effect at the time the crime was committed?     Or does it start with the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing?       We know that this district judge, he didn't want to get into any philosophical things about what was better or what was worse.     He said, I want to follow the guidelines.     So the question for him was only which guideline. He got his answer from the Seventh Circuit. They said the guidelines at the time of sentencing.     A judge in the D.C. District Court will get the other answer, the guidelines in effect at the time the crime was committed.       But it's not -- it's not a question of whether the judge thought that the one guideline was better than the other.     He specifically said he wasn't interested in that question.     The question was which guideline does he follow?     Which - what does he start with?     And you recognize that you do start with the guidelines.       But the district court was following orders.     He was following the Seventh Circuit.     The Seventh Circuit had said, you start with the higher guidelines.       Was Judge Randolph wrong when he said -- quoting the Sentencing Commission -- that within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the standard?     Indeed, the actual impact of Booker on sentencing has been minor, and, for that minor, he cites the Sentencing Commission.       But this statement comes from Final Report on the Impact of the United States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.

12-696 +++$+++       On the remedy, this case was remanded by the Second Circuit for the parties together with the court to work out appropriate relief. And if you could tell us what you think that relief would be, because then that is a measure of the constitutional infraction. So what would -- you put yourself before the district judge and propose the changes that you think would be necessary to bring this practice within the constitutional boundary.      What my question was -      -- your theory, and you say existing situation violates the Constitution.    So what changes do you think would need to be made -      -- that would bring this within the constitutional boundary?
12-71 +++$+++        And those are what?       What are they?       What are the additional -- the question here is, is proof of citizenship an additional thing the State can ask.     Now you're telling us that there are some additional things.       Can you -- can you Page 42 explain -- it's puzzling.     You have all these State-specific and pages of State-specific requirements. What State-specific requirements are permitted and what State-specific requirements are not permitted?     You're putting the citizenship on the not permitted side of the line.     What is permitted and what is not permitted and what's the difference in the two categories?       Mr. Srinivasan, I think General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the Page 56 Commission didn't act on it.     Only the legal director. So how could they get court review of an agency decision that was never made?
12-729 +++$+++        Isn't it true that in insurance contracts, generally, where there is this proof of loss as the trigger, there isn't a mandatory administrative -- most States don't have this mandatory administrative review.       Ms. Carroll, did I understand you before to be taking the position that even if Congress enacted a statute of limitations with an accrual rule, that that might not be effective as against a plan provision that provides for the trigger being proof of claim?
12-751 +++$+++    Mr. Mann, I think it would help if you raised the podium a bit so you're closer to the microphone.   Mr. Mann, you said you were going to deal with the rock and a hard place.But it's been put to you that if the trustee goes out and sells, that would be a signal that things are bad with the company. So it will end up being worse for the beneficiaries of the plan.   What about the argument - so you have outside trustees, they have to get information from the insider and if they get the information from an insider we're back in the same place.
12-7515 +++$+++ 
12-761 +++$+++    But the NLEA provision doesn't preempt all State law claims, only some State law claims.   Do you have an example, Ms. Sullivan, of a case where Congress precluded some State claims and said nothing at all about Federal laws in which this Court has held that the express preclusion of State law claims implicitly precluded Federal claims?   But maybe the two acts are serving different purposes, Ms. Sullivan. The law that you are relying on is supposed to be concerned with nutritional information and health claims, not a competitor is a competitor losing out because of the deception. The consumer is able to buy the Coke product much cheaper and the POM product costs more; the consumer thinks that they are both the same, so they'll buy the cheaper one.   Well, Mr. Waxman clarified that that's not what they are seeking. They just want to say your label is misleading. And is there -- what statute or regulation of the FDA says that compliance with the permissive regulation of the FDA necessarily renders the label non-misleading?   I understood them to say they were making a Lanham Act challenge. And there is no judicial review of the FDA regulations. There's no private right of action under the FDA.   So they are not saying, We're bringing an action under the FDCA or the NLEA. They say, We're bringing a Lanham Act.   Let's suppose there were a consumer survey, as there was, but -- and -- and say it was a valid survey. And overwhelmingly, consumers said that they are misled, that they thought that they were getting pure pomegranate, and they were just astonished to find what they were getting was apple juice with, what Mr. Waxman told us, a dropper of blueberry.   Suppose -- suppose the reality is that consumers are misled.   Ms. Sullivan, I would like you to respond to this question: In the real world, the FDA has a tremendous amount of things on its plate, and labels for juices are not really high on its list. It has very limited resources. You are asking us to take what it has said about juice as blessing this label, saying it's not misbranding, when its regulations aren't reviewed by the Court, when there is no private right of action, and say that that overtakes the Lanham Act. It's -- it's really very hard to conceive that Congress would have done that.   So that's contrary to its current position, and I think we have to take it -- the FDA is -- is -- the government is representing the current FDA position.   Would that -- without regard to deference, we don't resurrect the statement that they no longer support.
12-7822 +++$+++       Would that be so if Fernandez left -- he's made known his objection and then he says I'm going to pick up something at the drugstore. The minute he leaves, can the police then say to his cohabitant, do you consent?    She says, yes.    Police come in?      Then you could reduce Randolph to nothingness by saying the police -- as long as the police act lawfully to get the objector out, then they can override, that his objection doesn't count.
12-786 +++$+++    An infringement without an infringer.
12-79 +++$+++        Mr. Goldstein, I take it, from what you said up to now, that you are not defending the Fifth Circuit's test.     It called for a determination whether the misrepresentation is the heart or the crux of the complaint.       Aren't those rather academic because SLUSA wouldn't be a bar to them anyway, because then that's class actions?       But you're not contesting at this point -- I think both courts below assumed that the assets included stocks that would be traded on the exchange.     You're not making the argument that it's not necessarily -- that maybe the portfolio included nothing that was traded on the exchange?
12-794 +++$+++    But the courts in those cases had a specific issue before it. Its attention wasn't called to what I suggested is in the nature of an affirmative defense. The defendant has the burden to persuade the jury on mitigators.   Was there any other -- defendant didn't say, I'm sorry. Was there -- was there anything else? Did the defendant produce anything else in the way of remorse?   I'm curious about one facet of this case. This instruction was sought by the defendant. The prosecutor had no objection to it. The judge said, I'm sorry, I am not going to use that instruction. Is that common in Kentucky, that both parties agree that an instruction should be given, and the judge says, I'm not going to give it?   How could this be -- let's assume that you're right, that there was error. How could it be harmful, given the -- that the mitigators -- that the aggravators were not in dispute, he had entered a guilty plea? So how was the defendant harmed by the failure to give this instruction?
12-815 +++$+++       Are you saying then that in every State agency adjudication attended by State court review -- yeah, that would apply?      So can you -- so can you then -- we have only the two cases.    We have Middlesex and Dayton, and you say this case belongs in that Younger category.    What State court adjudication, State agency adjudications attended by State court review, would fall outside Younger, your rationale of what Younger covers?      Well, then why wouldn't you say that Sprint was not the initiator of this State process?    Because Sprint withdrew its complaint, right?      Sprint -- Sprint withdrew its complaint.      Yes.    So at that point it becomes the board's proceeding.    It becomes a proceeding initiated by the board and not by Sprint.
12-820 +++$+++    May I -- may I ask you, I think your brief -- I may not be remembering it correctly, but I think you -- you said no equitable tolling, and everybody in all the other countries agree on that, but there is equitable discretion. I think that you -- and the question is, is there this equitable discretion notion?   How  how would that aid be invoked? Take Justice Scalia's example. The parent left behind in Mexico, no resources of her own or his own. How would the State Department get into the act?
12-842 +++$+++    But, Mr. Olson, you have said -- you make this distinction between the exemption in the Act and what can be discovered. But the discovery rule itself, the advisory committee, the note on the original drafting of the discovery rule says, "Statutes of the United States on execution," and certainly the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a statute of the United States on execution, "govern under this rule." And in case you don't get the point, it lists, oh, a few dozen statutes. For example, it says that you can't execute -- assign, execute, levy or issue other legal process against a Federal employee's retirement annuities. And there are all kinds of provisions, substantive provisions limiting what property is subject to execution.   But this is a note to the discovery rule.   It says that Rule 69, the discovery rule, is subject to statutes on execution.   Mr. Olson, but this is a sovereign, and as I understand the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, it says "execution, the foreign sovereign has immunity, has immunity except -- except when we're dealing with commercial property in the United States." So the statute starts with a blanket immunity against execution for the foreign sovereign and then says, but there is an exception for property -- commercial property in the United States.   I thought that that goes to jurisdiction and liability, the judgment of liability. Then there's a separate section on execution. And those two are not the same. You can have full authority to issue a judgment against Argentina. The execution portions of the statute are 1609 to 11, not 1606.   Could it be addressed to Argentina on your theory? I think it could.   I thought they objected to it. Didn't the banks object?   The banks, I thought that they objected to the subpoena.   And they are statutes and the rule, whether you divide it into the two parts, the substance was the same. The rule says you look to statutes of the United States. I don't know how -- I don't know how you get around the fact that the discovery rule itself says that the statutes of the United States are relevant.   I'm talking about Advisory Committee notes.   What they meant. And they meant that the discovery -- that there isn't a world where we have statutes and then the Federal Rules. There is an interplay between the two, and that's what the Advisory Committee that drafted the rule told us about it.   What about   Mr. Olson, what    what about, there are countries that have more restrictive views than we do about what information, financial information, is confidential. So this omnibus order says worldwide, we want to know what property worldwide. And suppose the country in which the property is located says: In our system, this property is - if the information -- the information that was sought from the bank was confidential. What then?   How many of the bondholders settled with Argentina? My understanding is the vast majority of them did.   The vast majority of the bondholders settled with Argentina.
12-8561 +++$+++    Mr. Dreeben, I would really like you to tell us, concretely, what the government's approach would be; that is, we have all is one position, nothing is another position, and the middle. The government comes down in the middle, and what I gather from your brief, you say there should be a reasonable formula to arrive at a starting point for further analysis. So I don't know what you propose as a starting point. What is the reasonable formula that the Court should use for its starting point?   How do you get to the 18,000?   And so it wouldn't   It wouldn't include the people who are not prosecuted, and it wouldn't include the people who, in the future, are prosecuted.   So you start with --   What about taking into account that the perpetrator, the uncle, that the restitution was something like $6,000; right?   So if there's any kind of proportionality, it seems that the possessor of two images should not be responsible for more than the person who perpetrated -- perpetrated this horrendous crime.   I would like you to, to the extent that you can, to help district judges get a handle on this, what formula should they use and what adjusting factors should they take into account after they have that starting formula?   What about at least the amount of the judgments she has already received? The total amount, I think, was 3.4 million that you're seeking?   And she has, so far, collected how much?   Would you at least deduct that from the --   But the point has already been made that it isn't a typical joint tortfeasor situation, where you can seek contribution from people who equally contributed. How would --   How would -- how would the defendant here go about seeking contribution?
12-872 +++$+++        But did -       And as far as the -- the preclusion is concerned, why does it make a difference whether it's ADEA or GERA?     Wouldn't the arguable preclusion be even stronger under -- under GERA because there is a special administrative remedy, you have to go to the EEOC first, and the only form for review is the Federal Circuit?       Let -- let's assume that the question that was presented is before us.     And you -- you have argued Fitzgerald.     The other side says Smith v. Robinson should control.     So why shouldn't the Handicapped Act decision control?     That, like the ADEA, has allowed procedural parts that wouldn't be included in an equal protection claim.
12-873 +++$+++    Has that been applied outside the context of the APA, that is, when the suit is against an agency?   Has it been applied to private party litigation?   So what makes this limit a prudential limit? You are supposed to put -- the notion of a prudential limit is there is Article III standing, but, even so, you can't sue because you don't meet the prudential.   Your zone of interests --   Your zone of interest, in response to Justice Scalia, would establish another tier of zone of interest. The -- arguably, within the zone is the APA standard. And you said, here, you could strike "arguably" and just have it within the zone.   So what's wrong with the -- what is it -- AGC, the antitrust standard? So it's got five things. And Justice Alito just suggested that maybe that's more generous to finding standing than -- than the reasonable interest.
12-895 +++$+++       Well, why don't we just take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's a 48-month crime, and then if you have a gun in connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months consecutive.    And your position seems to be that all you have to prove is facilitation of the underlying drug offense.    And it seems to me to -- to get 10 years of your life for the government proving no more than the 48-month charge is a bit much.      Mr. Bash, would you explain why in this situation the guy abetted a drug deal when there was no drug deal?    It had been thwarted. The drugs were stolen.    They were not engaged in any attempt to sell the drugs.    That was a failed attempt. So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal failed?
12-9012 +++$+++    There wasn't -- there wasn't anything at all in the record to suggest that there was undue -- that that 33 months was an undue delay.   And there's a question about this case that I would like you to answer before you finish. And this is a case of a young man, 19 years old, he gets hooked into this scheme. He gets $500 for each parcel, $1,000; and then he's ordered to make restitution of $219,000. He was a bit player in the scheme. What happened to the people who dreamed up this scheme, Lytle and Valadez?   So that -- but did they -- were they ordered to pay restitution for these two houses?   If the sale -- if at the time of sentencing, the house has not yet been sold, but there's no -- there's good reason for the delay, because for example, there are no bids at an earlier time, could the judge defer the restitution order until the house is sold?
12-929 +++$+++        The -- the clause here allows suits in -- in State or Federal court.     Suppose the clause -- the forum selection clause just said "all disputes shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk."     It doesn't say anything about the Eastern District of Virginia.     What would be the result then?       And equally -       And the same thing if - if the choice was of an arbitral forum, then you recognize in those two cases the result would have to be dismissal?       Only because the plaintiff -- the plaintiff's choice of forum was to be respected.     But if the plaintiff chooses a forum in violation of the contract, the whole rationale of that case falls.       It was to honor the plaintiff's choice of forum.     Well, the contract says the plaintiff doesn't have a choice.       That the only reason that Van Dusen came out the way it did was -- I think it was that Justice Black said the plaintiff's choice of forum merits respect.     It doesn't merit respect when the plaintiff has agreed that the suit will go forward someplace else.
12-930 +++$+++ 
12-9490 +++$+++    There's a tip that someone is carrying a concealed weapon, and we have held that that has to be corroborated -- corroborated. You can take out a concealed weapon in an instant and fire it and kill lots of people. In fact, it was pointed out that there are more deaths caused by guns than there are from drunk driving. So what's the difference? The -- the argument on the drunk driving is very, very dangerous, but so is having a gun in one's pocket.   But if you -- once -- once you brandish it, it's too late. The damage will be caused.   Why? Why  the  we have the case of the trusted informer. The informer several times has given the police tips and it turned out to be right. And then we have another side, the anonymous person. Then there's somebody who calls, gives a correct name and address, but no record at all of reliability. Why should the fact that the name is known -- the name of the informant is known, if the police have no reason to believe one way or another that this informer is reliable?   Why is that different from the knowledge in J.L., that they were three young men, and they were described, and the caller said, "The one with the gun is the one with the plaid shirt." All of that was corroborated by the police, and yet, we held that that was no indication that a crime had been committed.   But here, we have the police did follow the vehicle for about 5 miles and saw nothing erratic about the driving. So perhaps, if the police had immediately stopped the person or -- but don't -- don't we have to take account that there was no corroboration? When the police get there. Even if they could stop him instantly, when they have no corroboration, then that doesn't amount to reasonable suspicion.
12-96 +++$+++        General Verrilli --       General Verrilli, could you respond to the question that Justice Kennedy asked earlier, which was for why isn't Section 2 enough now? The government could bring Section 2 claims if it seeks privately to do.     Why isn't -- he asked if it was expensive.     You heard the question, so.
12-98 +++$+++        Is that -- is that what happens?     You said you -- that in North Carolina for workers' compensation -- for settlements that are subject to workers' compensation liens, you have this type of system.       How does it work for workers' compensation recoveries that have the same thing, they -- they owe the State for the medical.       Do you agree -- do you agree that the only flaw in the North Carolina statute is that it's a fixed amount, and that if it were a rebuttable presumption it would be okay?     If the North Carolina law says 30 percent is the cap, but in a particular case you can show that that's not a fair allocation?
12-99 +++$+++       But, Mr. Messenger, you are dealing with a decision that seems to uphold organizing agreements.    I just read the passage and all that it's saying is:    Find out if in this case there was some corruption involved.    But it does say employers and unions may set ground rules even if the employer and the union benefit from the agreement. So you seem to be construing the Eleventh Circuit decision to say something it didn't say, to say that organizing agreements violate 302.      Where is that?      It says -- it says that, at the end of that passage, curbing bribery and extortion are implicated.      And said that's what -      What is your position on the effect of the expiration of this agreement?      Then may I ask you, Mr. Messenger, to clarify, because I thought you told me before that some organizing agreements are okay.    Are you taking the position that all organizing agreements -- in other words, are you taking a position in opposition to what I read from the Eleventh Circuit, that organizing agreements can be valid?      So you -- you do you want us to say that -- that to the extent that the Eleventh Circuit said, "Employers and unions may set ground rules for an organizing campaign, even if the employer and union benefit from the agreement," you want us to say that that was wrong.      And it has -- it has been enforced under 301.    So it -- it would be odd to say that an agreement that is enforceable that court - courts haven't enforced agreements just like this under 301 are criminal under 302.      Have -- have courts enforced agreements just like this one under 301?      Is it -- we heard from the other side that that hundred-thousand-dollar payment for the ballot initiative was a benefit both because it would mean that there would be many more workers employed by the casino if they were allowed to go into this new line of business.    So that it wasn't payment to the employer of something that is of benefit exclusively to the employer.    It was to the union's benefit too.
12-992 +++$+++    Mr. Feldman, before --   Mr. Feldman, there's a -- there's a question that has not been -- that's not surfaced yet, but after Budinich, however you pronounce it, the rule makers changed Rule 58 (e), and now, 58(e) provides a mechanism for deferring the finality of the judgment until the fee question is decided. You didn't seek an order under 58(e), did you? You didn't ask the district judge, please defer the finality of the judgment until the fee question is decided.   So you didn't make that --   You still could have said to the judge, please defer the entry of judgment until you resolve the fee question, and you -- you would not be entitled to that relief, but it would be in the discretion of the judge. And so that's how the rulemakers thought this problem could be handled. You can't have a judgment that does not become final until the fee question is decided. But if there's -- absent that specific determination, then the judgment becomes final when it's final, and the fees are a separate matter. I mean, it seems to me that, now, that this mechanism in the rules to handle this, we should not depart from the rules, whether it's contract or statutory, it's separate. It's not part of the underlying judgment.   Mr. Feldman, going back to my 58(e) question, one thing that's interesting about the rulemakers' response to Budinich is they didn't -- they didn't make any distinction between statutory and contractual fee awards. You would have us divide the world up that way, statutes one rule, contracts another. But the -- the Rule 58(e) doesn't -- it's not confined to statutory fees.   That would apply to statutory fees as well, the argument about piecemeal, duplicative appeals.
13-115 +++$+++    Would you have taken the same position if all that had been was the first move, that is, the move to Fourth Street? Then there would have been about an equal distance from the pro-President demonstrators.   Well, then would you say that you would have no tenable case if they moved them just the one street over so they wouldn't be in a position to throw a hand grenade to the patio?   And have you -- you've conceded that there would be a security interest, in the hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are -- people are in front of that alley where they could throw a grenade. Once you concede that, then you say, but the security interest, the valid security interest is washed away because, in fact, it was reported.   There was -- in Judge Berzon's opinion, she seemed to think it was very important that when the President got into the motorcade to leave only one side had access. So leaving aside what happened when the group was moved, would you take the position that not moving them back before the President left was a violation of their First Amendment rights?
13-132 +++$+++    The Court is to make a rule not for this particular case, but for this category of cases. And I think what Justice Kagan pointed out is very nervous concern. That is, take an offense like failing to buckle up, even driving under the influence, not gang crimes, which is what we have in this case. It's your rule, then, that the cell phone is fair game no matter what the crime, no matter how relatively unimportant the crime. Is it all misdemeanors, all misdemeanors and that opens the world to the police.   Well, how would you? What is the rule? You're saying on the person. Suppose it's in the car in a holder or suppose it's in the passenger's seat? Are you saying that's -- you don't want to express an opinion about that? You only want to talk about what's in somebody's pocket?   But, Mr. Dreeben, if the -- the understanding was, when there's time, get a warrant. So here, you can seize the phone and you can secure the phone, and you could go to a magistrate and within an hour get permission to search. But what is the reason for cutting out the magistrate here? It's not -- the instrument itself is not going to be in any danger because the police have taken it and they've disabled it. So I don't understand why we cut the warrant out of this picture.
13-193 +++$+++    But that was a very special situation. In Golden they were going out after a particular candidate. It was not -- it was not a political view that an organization is taking, and they are not targeting this particular candidate, but they are targeting that issue, any candidate who supports that issue.   But didn't the Court say that there wasn't -- once that congressman wasn't going to run for office any more, there was no suggestion that they wanted to talk about somebody else.   Mr. Murphy, you said there was no credible threat of prosecution, but what about the harm that is occurring? Mr. Carvin said it's a very short time. They're brought before the commission, they have to answer this charge that they lied, that they made a false statement. And that just that alone is going to diminish the effect of their speech because they have been labeled false speakers, and it costs money to defend before the commission, right? That's not
13-298 +++$+++    The Federal Circuit in this case split in many ways, and it had our decisions to deal with. And you said, given Bilski and Mayo, this is an easy case. What is the instruction that escaped a good number of judges on the Federal Circuit? How would you state the rule?   How do you answer the argument that your view would extinguish business-method patents and make all software ineligible for patent protection?   I have a question about how do you identify an abstract concept. The -- a natural phenomenon, a mathematical formula, those are easy to identify, but there has been some confusion on what qualifies as an abstract concept.
13-299 +++$+++    The court below had a -- had a simple take on this. It says that "retirement funds" means funds set aside for the debtor's own retirement. Petitioner tells us that you don't defend that definition, the definition that "retirement funds" means the debtor's retirement funds. Is that so?   Is it so that you do not defend the position that "retirement funds" means funds set aside for the debtor's own retirement?   It's just -- it's just puzzling why you want to disassociate yourself from the clear position of the court below that "retirement funds" means the debtor's retirement funds. Why would you want to do that?
13-301 +++$+++    Where do we have the we have the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit. Where does it say that?   That's just the opposite of what Ms. Harrington told us. She said the only purpose of enforcing these subpoenas was the possibility of amending the FPAA. I thought I understood her to have said that.   Could you have said in the Tax Court -- now that the proceeding has begun in the Tax Court -- say, Tax Court, there is -- the subpoenas, they are attempting to get information that they could not have gotten from this court through discovery. So, court, say no enforcement.   Did you ask -- I mean, that would be a possibility. You're saying that once the case shifts to the Tax Court, it should be the Tax Court judgment, not a district court reviewing the subpoena.   But at the point where the summons is sought to be enforced, it may be that there is no Tax Court proceeding yet, and there may be never any Tax Court proceeding. So how can the district judge make the ruling predicting the future course?   But you told me before, I think, that the tax court can stop it. I asked you a question, could the tax court say now we're in court, any information has to be in compliance with the scope of discovery we allow. You said because there's a separation and the summons is enforced by the district court, the tax court will do nothing and indeed will accept the information that is made available as a result of the summons.   Do you agree with Ms. Harrington that the Salter case, where the government said in Salter, the First Circuit case, that the way to proceed is call -- call the agent? Ms. Harrington said, if I remember correctly, that the Salter decision became academic when TEFRA passed. Do you agree with that?
13-316 +++$+++    Mr. Yang, before you finish, Mr. Russell pointed out -- and I think Justice Sotomayor -- that there is Section 513. It deals with -- expressly with altered checks, but the penalty is much, much less. Is everything that is covered by 513 covered by 1344, too?   Is the government still taking the position that it took in the district court, that 1344(1) also covers this case?
13-317 +++$+++    May I ask you about the rebuttable presumption, Mr. Boies? You agree that the Basic is a presumption and that it can be rebutted, but you say that's a question for the merits. What difference does it make at what stage the rebuttal is allowed? What practical difference does it make if the inquiry is made at the certification stage rather than the merits stage?
13-339 +++$+++    But if you take this, the facts of this case, 10-year statute of repose, there was never a time when these plaintiffs -- when this -- these plaintiffs had an action that could be brought, just because the 10-year limitation ended their right to sue before they had a claim.   But it's not a commencement date in terms -- "commencement" means commencement of a lawsuit. The true trigger for the statute of repose here is not a commencement of a lawsuit date. It is the commencement of the running of the limitation period. But it isn't the time when you can commence a lawsuit.   But you couldn't commence an action. Say the last -- the defendant commits the last act, and then plaintiff sues the next day. Well, plaintiff can't sue the next day because the plaintiff doesn't know that she's been injured.   They picked up  they picked up on State statutes. And as I understand it, the very purpose of the statute of repose or the built-in statute of limitations is to check the discovery rule, to say, we don't want the discovery rule to operate after a certain amount of time, a certain amount of time has passed. So the notion of what has been called a statute of repose and a discovery rule, the very purpose of the repose statute is to say no discovery here.   It encouraged what did you say?   The study group was making recommendations to the States, and it made two discrete recommendations. One is time the statute of limitations from awareness of the injury and its cause; and the second was, instructing to the States, don't have any repose statutes because they will defeat our purpose of taking into account latency. So the study group is addressing State law. Then Congress does something different. It provides a Federal limitation period that is based on discovery of the injury plus the cause. The second recommendation made by the study committee abolished statutes of repose. Congress didn't do that.
13-354 +++$+++    Title VII was passed before 1993, so it wouldn't apply -- RFRA wouldn't apply to Title VII.
13-369 +++$+++    What about the apparatus on which the electrodes are mounted? Isn't that another variable way you can't say half an inch, because it depends, as you said, on size, shape, and materials of the electrodes. But doesn't it also depend on the apparatus?
13-461 +++$+++    Mr. Frederick --   -- was Judge Chin right when he said that there was no technically sound reason to use these multiple antennas? That the only reason for that was to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act. Was there a technical reason, instead of having a one big antenna, to have all of these what, dime-size antennas?   Mr. Frederick, would you clarify? If every other transmitter does pay a royalty -- maybe it's under compulsory license -- and you are the only player so far that doesn't pay any royalties at any stage --   They give the subscriber a menu, and it says you can get any of these things. It's not as though the -- the subscriber initiates it. You have these choices and they're providing you these choices and those choices are content.   But you are seeking subscribers, legions of subscribers. So I don't understand that. You say they have to -- are you selective, in that some people who want to use your service are going to be turned down? You're not. You will take anybody who can pay, right.   Alright so why do people pay for the Aereo service if they can do the same thing all by themselves?
13-483 +++$+++    Garcetti turned on what were -- what were the job duties of the particular person, and there the job duty was to investigate. Here, the distinction is, everybody agrees, that it's not part of the job description of Lane.   But in Pickering it was something that anybody could know. It didn't depend upon the job, learning on the job. I thought in Pickering the --   -- any citizen could have known that information. Here, the knowledge comes only because of the public employment.   And that wouldn't make any difference whether it was fact, opinion, views. I thought your distinction was -- was clear. You are saying if you learn the information on the job, then you're not protected, and it doesn't matter whether it's opinion, expression, as long as what you were speaking about is something that you've learned on the job. I thought that was your position.   Give me an example of an opinion that would be protected First Amendment speech, as you said, and yet is based on facts you learned only because of your public employment.
132, Orig. +++$+++           Are you relying on the caption to article 7 --  Eligible Parties; Withdrawal; Revocation; Entry into Force; Termination ?   The caption to article 7?           Mr. Dellinger, what of - what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $80 million gave North Carolina a leg up, should there ever be any revival of the development of a disposal facility; North Carolina is much better situated than anyone else to do this, because they have already sunk $80,000 into pursuing a license?          In this case -- in this case, how did it come about that the right to withdraw any time until the second plant was operable, was that -- that was North Carolina's proposal after it was designated to be the site?          Mr. Dellinger, your brief makes -- I think the reply brief made some reference to North Carolina's attempting to get funding from another source after Barnwell -- the revenues from Barnwell were no longer available to it. I think, in -- in your reply brief, you make some reference to an effort on North Carolina's part to get -- what -- what was that effort?             What about the offer -- what about the offer that Mr. Phillips brought up, said Commission was ready to pay another $21 million, and there was going to be loans from the generators?             But that was in -- Hess came up in a different posture.             It wasn't -- I think -- it was an attempt to sue the authority, wasn't it?             So I don't think that they are at all comparable.           This is a case of does the -- does the authority have standing or -- to bring the claim.           Why -- why not?        I mean, if it s totally a creature of States -- that s all it s -- there s no other shareholders, nobody in the picture, just -- they are all States that create it?           They create it, though. They -- the States create the --          How can -- how could they not be, Mr. Dellinger?          There s only one complaint, and that complaint is on behalf of all the Plaintiffs, not --            But there s no discrete claim made by the Commission as distinguished from South Carolina.
134 ORIG +++$+++               It's rather recent that Delaware has gotten into the business of regulating at all.   I thought that for most of this period until the '60s, Delaware just wasn't doing anything unless something was a nuisance, and that didn't come up.              I don't.                But you're not talking about nuisance.    You're talking about Delaware's environmental laws.      That's what this project concerns.                And you were saying Delaware's environmental laws trump whatever riparian right New Jersey can grant?               You used the word "riparian jurisdiction."         We have riparian rights. That's a familiar term.        Riparian jurisdiction which is used in Article VII is a novelty.
137, Orig. +++$+++        Mr. Jay, I thought that the Special Master -- very important to him was the meaning of "appropriative rights," and he said that the Wyoming law is just as you've described, that is, the farmer can use all that water; and he said Montana law is uncertain, but Wyoming law is not out of line with the general approach. Suppose this had been a case -- suppose Montana law, instead of being uncertain, was diametrically opposite Wyoming law, then what happens under this compact?
138, Orig. +++$+++             But even in the New Jersey v. New York decision, the dissenters there that would have allowed the intervention did say that in general it is unwise to encumber original jurisdiction cases with non-State parties.            That was even the dissenters.   So you start out with in general it's not wise to let these people come in. And following up on the Chief's question, a State can't be sued without its consent.            And it's true here that South Carolina is initiating the action, but it's initiating the action against a sister State.             The Special Master's recommendation would require the State to have as its direct adversary three parties who are not a sister State, and that kind of dilutes the notion of original jurisdiction.        It's a controversy between two States.             That's because the State chose to sue it as a party defendant.            The intervenors -- the intervenors are users of the water from the river?            They -- because they use a lot of water.    And my question is:             How do we decide once we say -- beyond the Special Master can let these people in with party status -- what users can come in where, obviously, we are not going to allow all users of the river water to come in, so which ones can and which ones can't?              Let's go back to the question of couldn't the Special Master receive the information she wants if these three entities come in as amici? Coming in as intervenors, they have full party status.   They can engage in discovery.           They can protract the case.     They can appeal any adverse judgment. Why isn't the most reasonable accommodation to say, well, we will listen to you, but we are not going to give you full party status?
11-398 +++$+++        They are different things.       This says "Immediately" -- the Reed Elsevier statute says immediately after instituted unless a copyright is registered.       So, why isn't that like the filing fee?     Before you can maintain a suit for copyright infringement, you have to register your copyright?       Why would --       Why would somebody not choose to obtain it?     Why -- that's one puzzle to me. There's this category of people who are Medicaid eligible; Medicaid doesn't cost them anything.     Why would they resist enrolling?       But it may be just that they haven't been given sufficient information to understand that this is a benefit for them.
11-400 +++$+++ 
12-1226 +++$+++    That's the first clause. But, I mean, instead of talking in the abstract, can you give me any example of a case that a plaintiff would lose under the first clause that puts pregnancy together with sex.   Then you are saying second clause adds nothing even though Congress said "and." There is one clause because of sex, includes pregnancy, "and" something in addition. But you are saying it's not really in addition.   That's what the first clause does. It says pregnancy and sex, period. You have already said that you don't think that the second clause does any practical work. That is, you can't conceive of a case where a plaintiff would loose under clause one and win under clause two.   You are departing -- you are departing radically from what the Fourth Circuit view in this -- I mean, the Fourth Circuit did say, right up front, that this clause standing alone is unambiguous; if a group of employees get the benefit, if other employees get the benefit, so must pregnant women. But the Fourth Circuit said, yes, that's what it says just standing alone, but because it would lead to untoward results, preferential treatment, we're not going to give it --   -- that meaning.   But it -- it enacted it to overturn Gilbert, everybody --   -- and not just some abstract theory, but the result --   -- in Gilbert. And as Justice Kagan pointed out, Gilbert was a case where you could point to a lot of other people who were not getting this benefit.   Is it -- is it true essentially -- I mean, you said that -- that Young's position is most favored nation. Well, yours is least favored nation, right?   This -- this case went off on summary judgment --   -- so the facts -- Mr. Bagenstos has told us that there is not in this record a single instance of anyone who needed a lifting dispensation who didn't get it except for pregnant people.   And if that's the case in fact, then you lose, don't you?   But do we know in fact -- this is an allegation that in fact no one who wanted a dispensation didn't get it except pregnant women.   But we have -- we're on the summary judgment stage, so we don't know what the facts are.   Can you give an example then? Is there an employee who asked for a dispensation because of a medical condition that restricted her ability to lift, to any single employee employed -- who was -- said, sorry, you don't get it because your injury was off duty?   They -- they suffered off-the-job injuries, but we don't know if they asked for a dispensation because the off-the-job injury would reguire that they limit the weight that they could bear.   The original -- the original guideline, as I understand EEOC, what they did in 2014, they said, we were terse the first time around. All we're doing in 2014 is explaining that what the original -- what was -- it was '79, the original --   So essentially it says any group that doesn't get the benefit, a group that is non-pregnant, then pregnant people are -- any group at all?   What category of employees?   Singling out is in the first -- is what the first --
12-1497 +++$+++    But it's placed -- placed in the Criminal Code. It's placed in Title 18.   Changed the law to do what? They changed it to --   -- operating prospectively, not just to crimes that had already occurred?   So that's one change that everybody agrees.   The government can pursue it in a criminal case. The guestion is whether --   -- the civil --   The problem is that --   Everyone agrees that from 1921 on, it was understood that this was a criminal statute and I think the point has been made before. If Congress really was going to change it, to vote it all onto the excision of two words which can be explained on other grounds, it's a bit much. Wouldn't Congress have said, now we're going to make it -- we want it to be civil, so we're going to make it clear that it's civil?   Well, there was a reason.   The statute acted retrospectively for the first part of its history, and then they took it out when it was going to operate prospectively.   What happens -- what happens if you have a first filer who brings a claim, it's successful, either gets a judgment or gets a settlement, and the case is over? It's no longer pending.
126, Orig. +++$+++    Didn't the special master say that was the risk that Nebraska should have known, so -- and he said they did this and that, but it wasn't enough and it wasn't until 2007 that they came into compliance in a way that didn't put Kansas in jeopardy. But he said all along Nebraska knew that Kansas might well be the loser, because Nebraska didn't take adeguate steps. It was aware of the risk to Kansas, right?
13-1010 +++$+++    Is that -- is that the Second and Seventh -- are you saying essentially you agree with the position of the Second and Seventh Circuits?   Is -- is one of -- is one of the ingredients that goes into this mix the background rule that I -- I thought your friend would bring up, and that is it is the normal rule in contract interpretation that when the contract expires, so do its terms. If you start with that, contract expires, all its terms expire. Isn't that --
13-1019 +++$+++    Well, what has been going on, in fact, in these cases now with some courts having just general good faith, others having a three factor test? You raised a problem here that the EEOC was hit with a bunch of interrogatories. Has that been going on?
13-1032 +++$+++    Mr. Domenico, you don't dispute that what Congress had in mind when it passed the Tax Injunction Act was the proposition that States that have a system, taxpayer, you pay now, you sue for a refund later. It was that scheme that the Tax Injunction Act was meant to shield so the taxpayer couldn't say I'd rather pay later. You pay up front, and then you sue for a refund. That's -- that was what was in the front of Congress's mind. You don't doubt that, do you?   Your argument is at least intentioned with this Court's decision in Hibbs. So what is your best argument for why Hibbs doesn't control? Hibbs says this statute is about stopping taxpayers from avoiding the obligation to paying the government, and here we have a third party not a taxpayer.   But that -- the question -- this is just a forum question; right?   You can sue in Federal court. The question wouldn't be the one you posed. The question would be the one on the merits: Does this violate the Commerce Clause?
13-1034 +++$+++    But a  a sock. I mean, one of the strange things about this case is you have a disjunction. A sock doesn't count as drug paraphernalia under the Federal law, but it does under the State law; it means any container. And then to take that State law -- I mean, suppose we -- we have a conviction for one of those drugs that's not on the Federal list, just for possession of that drug, and then we have another conviction where that drug is inside a sock and it's for drug paraphernalia. So in the one case you would say not removable, if it's just the substance itself, and in the other case, because of the sock, it becomes removable?
13-1041 +++$+++    Why wouldn't the 2006 interpretation, which you say should have stuck, why if this -- if it's -- if it's legislative, if it's substantive, then the 2006 interpretation was equally defective because there was no notice and comment for the 2006. If you are trying to characterize the 2010 rule as not interpretative, I don't see how you can say, oh, but the 2006 rule was interpretative. Especially since there were the earlier rulings the other way. What was it, the 2001 and -- so it seems to me that you want it to be interpretative when it favors you and you want it to be not interpretative -- you want the 2006 to be interpretative because you didn't go through notice and comment, right?   But I don't understand why we should say go back to an interpretation that didn't get -- I mean, I can see you say the 2010 should have had notice and comment. But why return to an earlier position that didn't have notice and comment? I think you could say wipe it all out, start over, but I don't see how you can say the 2006 rule sticks when it has the same defect on your view the 2010 did.   I don't follow that because it seems as far as the change, the -- an employer who had relied in good faith on the 2006 interpretation is home free. That much was clear.   But why wouldn't -- well, how could there not be good faith? Here's a regulation, I followed it. What more do I need to show good faith?   But the employer would say here's interpretative rule 2006. I followed it to the letter. What more would need to be shown than here's a regulation on the books, an interpretation on the books, I followed that interpretation, I thought it was clear that such an employer would not be liable for the past? Now, for the future is something different.
13-1074 +++$+++    Mr. Schnapper, what do you do with what I take to be the government's main argument? They said here are these two statutes waiving the government's sovereign immunity. The Tucker Act, no eguitable tolling. Tort Claims Act comes later, it uses a lot of the same language, it has the same object, so the Tort Claims Act should be interpreted in harmony with the Tucker Act.   Mr. Schnapper, I think we're getting off the track that Justice Breyer put us on, and I think you agreed with him, that there's no evidence that Congress ever thought anything about what was going to happen in a case like Ms. Wong. They -- they enacted a statute, and it had a statute of limitations, a firm statute of limitations, but there's no indication that Congress thought about jurisdiction. We all -- all that jurisdiction stuff comes from ( decisions of this Court.   Mr. Schnapper -- Mr. Schnapper, I think that I heard a disagreement between you and Justice Scalia on how close the words were, and you said, yes, there are some phrases in common, but there are big differences, too, in the wording of the Tort Claims Act. So you can pick out some words and say, yes, Congress adopted that language, but in other parts it didn't take the Tucker Act as the model used different language.   The government answered -- you're saying the difference is the district court has all kinds of eguitable authority, claims court didn't. But the government answered that argument and said there's a difference between eguitable doctrines, which the claims court followed, it's just that the claims court can't give eguitable remedies like injunction. So the government's answer is isn't that divide, that eguity is part of the jurisprudence of the claims court?
13-1075 +++$+++    Mr. Rosenkranz, in that regard, would you clarify what is the Government's -- what is your position in response to the Government's rather strong answer to your suggestion that eguity was foreign to the claims court?   It didn't say the opposite. It said the claims court didn't have the authority to give eguitable remedies. It didn't have the authority to enjoin. But from the beginning it had eguitable doctrine as part of its --   Mr. Rosenkranz, may I interrupt you because I thought I heard Ms. Prelogar say that at the time that the FTCA was adopted, there were only four States that applied tolling.
13-1080 +++$+++    But if the government agency, the FRA, it says, you know, what Amtrak proposes, the government's assent is essential to this scheme, right?   And not look at the animal as it exists? Lebron said that the government exerts control over Amtrak as a policy maker. This -- Amtrak, you will agree, is not like a private corporation. It's -- there's a great deal of federal involvement in Amtrak, right?   The due process guestion wasn't -- the due process guestion wasn't aired below at all; isn't that so?   And not decided by the D.C. Circuit.   And not decided --   -- because the D.C. Circuit went on a delegation.
13-1174 +++$+++    Where they remain separate actions, and Rule 54 (b) was designed for a single action with multiple claims.   I don't see a single reference in the rule, nothing by the advisory committee that so much as suggests that a consolidation for pretrial purposes only makes it one action for purposes of 54 (b) .   Not any --   Well, that's because the parties, either they get dismissed pretrial, or they settle, or the parties agree that the transferee court can be the trial court. But at no -- no one in a multidistrict litigation can be forced into going before the transferee court for trial.   And I think it was guite clear that Congress didn't give multidistrict forum the option to be the trial court.   He has the word of the district judge you have an appeal of right, that's what she said.   She thought that she needed to the to do the 54(b) for the other cases that had more than one claim, not just the antitrust claim.   Mr. Waxman, the Second Circuit didn't think that there was a problem because the -- a judgment hadn't been entered. They said in all of these cases when a consolidated or pretrial, there is no right of appeal, you have to get permission under rule 54 (b) . They did not say anything about the problem in this case is that there was no judgment document. And isn't there, I know that there -- there is a provision that says, if the judgment -- if for some reason you don't have the piece of paper, that's not fatal.   Are you telling me that the Second Circuit doesn't have that rule if there is a piece of paper that says judgment on it?   Well, 1292(b) can't be applicable here.   1292(b) is when you don't have a final judgment. It's an interlocutory appeal, the typical case for 1292(b) is the court decides liability, but it hasn't decided damages yet. You can't run upstairs at that point unless you get a 1292(b) order.   But it's a different reason. She said in the Gelboim case you have no antitrust injury. In other words, you have no standing, out the door. And you say the other cases are different from that. Is -- they don't center on antitrust injury?   But if the district judge had been right the first time, she said I have a claim that's totally been dismissed, it's out, then there are these other people that have antitrust claims and other claims, so what I'm going to do is this, final judgment for the one that has no other claims, 54 (b) on the antitrust claims for the others so that the Second Circuit will then hear antitrust standing all at once.   Well, the district judge obviously didn't think so because she said, I'm -- one party has an appeal of right and I am going to do the 54(b) order for the others.   Well, then that sort of contradicts what you said before. You said she wasn't going to deal with these things piecemeal. By the way, on that point, she said, given the reaction of the Second Circuit more than once, it's time to give up. She said that first, as -- as far as that's --   But to what -- what --   What is obscure about a stay? Multidistrict cases have lots and lots of issues, and quite often stays of some cases are issued. That's not --   -- obscure.
13-1175 +++$+++    Well, what would be the nature of the objection? I'm going back to Mr. Rosenkranz's answer to my question. He said, the -- there is no notion of probable cause, reasonable cause. The hotel owner is required to keep these records and the -- that's not disputed. They're each required to keep them. And so -- and the police don't have to have any reason. What would be -- what would be shown by some kind of a hearing?   But you said they could be -- they can be -- they can be sequestered by the police officer, they even answered before, that suggested you have to have some outside approval. But now you're saying if the hotel owner says, you can't have these records, the police can say, give me the books and take them away.   I think that's -- if you had such a case-specific example, that might be one thing. But maybe it would help if you can tell me what goes on in this pre-compliance judicial review.   So the hotel owner says, sorry, you can't look at the registry, I want pre-compliance judicial review.   What is the nature of that review?   And those are the only objections that would be --   -- successful, harassment and using this for law enforcement?
13-1211 +++$+++    What about the point that the question really is what was the scope of each -- what was the scope of the original mark and the later one?   What about obviousness in patent law? That' -- that, I take it, is also a legal -- legal issue.   What part does the judge in setting the boundaries by deciding the question either on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law, that -- I -- my thought was that a judge would not let -- that the bounds of the doctrine were decided by the judge when he puts the question to the jury.
13-1314 +++$+++    Are you saying that --   -- there's no -- nobody would have standing, because it seems the legislature, if anyone, has standing, and they are, as an institution, affected.   Well, they have to --   But as Mr. Clement points out, the legislature, in both Smiley and Hildebrant, remain the prime mover. And what he has objected to is taking the legislature out of the picture entirely.
13-1333 +++$+++    Do states have similar rules?   Isn't that what the court of appeals held here?   The court of appeals said you do get the appeal from the third strike.   But is that before us? You -- I thought that this appeal is about the fourth case, and that you haven't -- you haven't contested the court of appeals' holding that you do get an appeal from the third strike.
13-1352 +++$+++    I'm looking at the -- the -- the judge said this witness is not -- this child is not competent to testify as a witness, and you've read the transcript. How -- how can there be a guestion of cross-examining a 3-year-old? The -- this person is incompetent as a witness because the -- the testimony is unreliable?   Well, just let me stop you. Part of your answer I don't follow because one thing is the child is asked immediately, on the spot, close in time to when this occurred. The trial is months later, and one of the problems with 3-year-olds is they don't remember.   That -- that case, the ! child was held competent as a witness.   This --   But by confrontation you mean the -- you -- you have a therapeutic expert, but as the defendant's witnesses, you're not -- I don't think you suggested that the Court could appoint its own expert and the defendant would be out of it. I mean, this is -- the way we do things in our adversary system is you're a partisan expert, you're the defense expert.   Mr. Fisher, I would like to ask you, before we get to the four -- your four points, it just seems to me that a teacher looking at a child who has been abused, the first reaction of that teacher is just as Justice Alito suggested: Get that child out of harm's way. Don't give that child back to a potential abuser. So the teacher, I would think, is not thinking about prosecution down the road: What can I do to assure the safety of this child right now?   But before we --   -- get to the prosecutor, is this child going to be returned to this person who the child has identified as -- it seems to me that -- that there is a concern immediately with the child's safety, and there is also, down the road, the potential prosecution. But the -- if you have to divide what is the prime purpose, it seems to me that the well-being of the child has got to be the first thing in the mind of the teacher.   Much too late.   Did we -- I'm going to use the primary purpose test at all. Maybe it doesn't fit as has been suggested, but what of the information that a few of the briefs conveyed, that in most of these cases, the abuser is not criminally tried. There is an attempt to provide for the safety of the child and maybe there is family counseling, but in most cases -- most cases, a criminal prosecution is not waiting at the end of the road.
13-1371 +++$+++    Well, what was, in fact, the remedy? I mean, this was a case where there was litigation, you prevailed, and there was a remedy. So there was disparate impact. And what did the Court say had to be done to cure it, to cure what it saw as the offense to the Fair Housing Act?   Don't you have a tension between two statutes here? I mean, you have the Fair Housing Act; and then there is the law that sets up this tax credit, right? And doesn't that law say that there should be a priority for revitalizing decaying communities?   Why shouldn't it get more if the tax law expresses that preference for the revitalization?   And what is the practice here? Because that was the question Judge Jones --
13-1402 +++$+++    Can you explain how we get to the constitutional claim that she has a right to live in the United States with her husband? She has a right by statute to put him at the top of the queue, right? She -- she -- before he can apply, she has to get him the preferential status, right?   So we have -- so she has -- she has marriage, and you rely on that the right to marry includes the right to live with one's spouse. What do you do with Turner against Safley? The Court held that the prisoner had a right to marry, but certainly not a right to live with his spouse.   I thought that the statute includes a provision that notice of the reason need not be given in the case of a national security.   Does that -- would that apply even if she didn't -- she comes in because she has a right to apply for priority status for her spouse. ! Suppose there were no such right, but he's her husband. You seem to be arguing that the husband/wife relationship is the constitutionally protected relationship, so it wouldn't matter if there were no priority status involved. Or what do you get out of the statute that says the wife can apply for priority status for her husband?   But it's not necessary. You would say the marital relationship, citizen wife/alien husband, just by virtue of that relationship, she can contest the government's refusal to explain why this person was excluded.
13-1487 +++$+++    Sold -- that is -- is it the government's position that it's the licensed firearm dealer or -- in effect, forfeited to the government? Is there any other transferee in the government's view that would be appropriate?   But it would have to be sold, but the sale would be -- or the consignment would be to a licensed dealer. You're rejecting the friends. You're rejecting the wife.   Would you agree that the Unclean Hands part, that should not remain the law of the circuit?   So we should -- we should address that and reject it?
13-1499 +++$+++    Could they -- could Florida apply this canon to candidates for political office?   Yes. If Florida says, we think it's such a good idea for the judges, we want to make it across the board, no candidate for political office can make a direct appeal for money.   I thought the whole idea of the Florida Supreme Court when they adopted this rule is just that, that they wanted to put judges above the political fray, so they didn't want them to seek contributions. Call it dignity, call it the integrity of the judiciary, call it the public shouldn't perceive of judges as being political officers, so we shouldn't say an election for a judge is the same thing as an election to the legislature. The whole idea is to put the judiciary in a separate category. I thought that was Florida's idea.   Mr. Richard, there is something that the other side has said about your position and I'd like your answer to it, that is that what you are advocating will help the people who are already in the judiciary, the people who have lots of money so they don't need contributions from others, the people who will be hurt are like Ms. Yulee, who is trying for the first time. In other words, the Florida bar has set up a system that works in favor of incumbents, yes, current officeholders and the rich.
13-212 +++$+++    But you're not questioning the ability of the police to take the phone. I thought that that was a given, that incident to the arrest, the police could take the phone. The question is whether they can search it without a warrant.   What would be an exigent circumstance where you could search, in your view?   You said you had -- you are arguing for a flat rule to the police, thou shalt not unless there are exigent circumstances. So what would be an exigent circumstance where the police, without getting a warrant, could search the cell phone?
13-271 +++$+++ 
13-352 +++$+++    Mr. Katyal --   Mr. Katyal, Justice Scalia suggested that these are not expeditious proceedings before the whatever it is, TTAB. And what -- what is the situation there? I know it's a lot less expensive to go to the board than it is to go to a court, but how rapidly are these processed?
13-433 +++$+++    And how do you explain that you're not compensated for the time you are on the line waiting to don your protective gear? Protective gear, donning it itself, that's a required part of the job, and you're compensated for that. But you're not compensated for the wait to do that.
13-435 +++$+++    Mr. Goldstein, can I just clarify what seems to be your point. You do not take the reasonable factual basis. You are saying it's the same thing as if we excised "we believe." That you take that out, and then you have a statement of fact which is false, and then they're responsible. So you're really saying there is no such thing as an opinion versus a fact, that it's just the same as if they left out "we believe."
13-502 +++$+++    So if the sign here said, "We welcome you to attend our church service," and then it says on the bottom, meeting place, and it specifies the meeting place, but the message is "we welcome you to attend our service," that's ideological?   But it says also "welcome you to attend our church service, it will be held at." So it's giving the direction, but it's also expressing the message that everyone is welcome to come worship.   But you did say in your brief that the First Amendment does not require directional signs, so they could be banned altogether.   Well, that is a lot of words. I'm giving you an example. The law says no directional signs. That's the law. Does that -- is -- does that offend the First 4 Amendment?   Does this State statute have the same size and duration? The State statute says that you have to allow political signs, but does it specify the size and the duration?   So you're saying that the town ordinance just mirrors the State?   And do you have that State law?   You say the street is not a -- not a traditional public forum?   What is the -- what is the guidance? I'm looking at the Good News signs on page 3 of the little brief. It just has an arrow. It says the name of the elementary school, and then it has -- it looks like a telephone number and an arrow. The arrow is a direction?   This is not, as you described earlier, turn left on Main Street, turn right on Front Street.   Does Good News -- does the Good News church have a number of signs -- just as illustration, how many signs do they have?
13-517 +++$+++    Is -- Ms. Birnbaum, is there no way, is there no way to police the honesty of jurors' answers on voir dire? This is an obvious way, if it were permissible, to police the honesty. But is there any other way?
13-534 +++$+++    But they are not practicing lawyers?   I thought they agreed to the stipulation that this was an articulated State policy, and the guestion was must there be in addition supervision. But you -- you've conceded for purposes of this argument the articulated State policy, didn't you?
13-550 +++$+++    Well, the district court said more than that. It did say there has to be a change in circumstances. Mr. Frederick told us -- and you can tell us if he was wrong -- that they did not have any opportunity in the district court to say there should be these periodic monitorings because the court said after the initial investment in the fund first when you buy the plan. After that, there's no obligation other than if there's changed circumstances. Then you have to take another look. That's what the district court -- as I read it -- said, and that hemmed in these Plaintiffs and they couldn't say. We're talking not about a continuing violation, ongoing monitoring not necessarily triggered by a change in circumstances.   Mr. Hacker, Mr. Frederick cited Petition Appendix page 18 and 19.   He said that is a statement of the Ninth Circuit law that Petitioners think is incorrect and that they would like to have this Court correct.   Because they thought that was the circuit law, that they had to show changed circumstance; otherwise, they wouldn't have a monitoring claim.   How about just saying that the changed circumstances seems to have confused everybody? The Ninth Circuit used it. You used it repeatedly. This Court should X that out and then you're in perfect harmony.   He didn't say the cheapest fund. He said there is a stock difference between the retail and the institutional cost.
13-553 +++$+++    Yes. So what do you do with -- the -- the district judge did make the comparison between the motor carrier tax, and -- and you -- you say that -- that comparison was inadequate because?   But it also said that if you don't engage in that kind of comparison, then you're going to end up with the railroad becoming the most favored taxpayer.
13-604 +++$+++    What about -- what about the dissenter in the North Carolina court of appeals who said North Carolina has no good-faith exception, and so all that this decision does is it allows the police to get around the absence of a good-faith exception? Wasn't that the position of the dissenter, that allowing for a reasonable mistake of law to support a warrantless stop is the functional equivalent of a good-faith exception?   Why does it -- why should you draw the line between if he gets the Fourth Amendment wrong, the Fourth Amendment is violated, but if he gets the statute wrong, then the Fourth Amendment is not violated?   Well, the fact that he made a mistake about what the Fourth Amendment requires could also be reasonable.   The one argument that is in your brief that I didn't follow is that the importance of holding the way you recommend is so that when you get this question solved, you tee up the question, what is the rule, one light or two lights. But yet in this case, it was consent. The evidence that came in had nothing at all to do with the traffic violation, so we wouldn't need to -- the Court wouldn't need to decide the traffic violation, say -- it was consent. I think the North Carolina Immediate Appellate Court said it was a legitimate consent. It was consent, and this evidence comes in, and we never had to deal with what the traffic regulation was.
13-628 +++$+++    General Verrilli, it is -- the requirement of place of birth on the passport, that doesn't come from the Congress. That comes from the executive, right?   And I thought that the purpose of birthplace identified by the government, by the executive, is to identify the person and not -- it's not something that the President or the executive required out of a foreign policy concern. The purpose of it was to identify the individual; isn't that right?   Ms. Lewin answered, I think quite candidly --   General Verrilli, I think the answer to the question that Ms. Lewin gave was that she said yes, the Executive could put that on the passport. But she also said Congress could then pass a law saying, this is antithetical to our view, and that doesn't have to be put on the passport. On the passport is just birthplace, Israel, period. Congress could pass that into law and counter whatever the President does.
13-6827 +++$+++    On altered appearance, I thought it was conceded that at intake, the prison could take a photograph clean -- clean shaven?   So are you telling us that the guarter inch is wrong? I thought that that was in the record as a given, that a guarter inch is allowed for medical reasons.   Did you establish that Arkansas is unlike all these other States, that the other States don't have barracks, they don't have people going out to work in the field? I thought that that was not so, that there are other prisons that operate similarly with housing and having the prisoners work on a farm.   What about the Federal prison system? I thought the rule was throughout the prison system.   One of the hazards is razors. You just said that they can shave themselves in the barracks. Where do they get those razors and what happens to them?   Does your standard -- how, if at all, does your standard differ from what it would be if we had no RLUIPA? Is there any case -- now we have RLUIPA -- any case that would come up differently in Arkansas under RLUIPA than under the preexisting law?
13-684 +++$+++    Mr. Waxman, please review what you just said because, as I understand it, the lender has to give the borrower a notice of opportunity to rescind which says, the borrower may cancel. How? By notifying the lender at the lender's place of business by mail or telegram, period. And then two copies of that are to be given, with the instruction, use one to cancel the transaction. So it's a form that says, "This notice cancels the transaction."   But in Beach there was no notice within the 3 years.   This isn't at common law. This is a statute and (b) describes how rescission works under this statute, 1635(b).
13-7120 +++$+++    Wasn't there something in one of these briefs that a manufacturer in States where these weapons are lawful has advertised them as ideal for use in self-defense?   What about the -- what about the analogy to -- explosives, you say that there could be lawful possession because explosives, it's use that's given as an enumerated crime.   Why not burglar tools? Isn't it -- burglar tools are outside, right? Possession of burglar tools will not get you under ACCA.   But there's no other use. There's no other use for burglar tools than in burglary.
13-719 +++$+++    But it was just pointed out that lawyers in the Tenth Circuit are not going to take that risk. The Tenth Circuit precedent, which the district court followed, says you must produce in the notice of appeal evidence. So what lawyer is going to say to his client, now, we can easily do that, but I won't because I want to test whether the Tenth Circuit precedent is wrong. As a practical matter, this will be unreviewable because the lawyers will simply conform to what the Tenth Circuit says is the law.   Maybe -- maybe because it thought there wouldn't be any controversy. Maybe they thought the defendant thought the plaintiff would agree that the amount was over the jurisdictional order.   Do you pay any attention at all to the obvious purpose of the Class Action Fairness Act, which was to get cases out of the State courts and into the Federal courts? Usually, we don't have that strong Federal policy of having the adjudication in the Federal court.   You said that you would argue that the amount in controversy was not satisfied and it seems to me that most plaintiffs who are bringing class actions are not going to be argued, oh, we can't prove $500,000.   You had alleged in your complaint that the damages that you were seeking were under $500,000. If that's what you thought, then you would be --   But when they -- when they did allege in the notice of removal that the amount in controversy was met, you didn't contest that.   But what you didn't say is that there is no such evidence and that our damages are less than $500,000.   But there's a peculiar this State doesn't reguire the complaint to state the amount in controversy. But if you were bringing this case in the Federal court in the first instance would you have said as plaintiff, the damages that we seek are under 5,000 -- 500,000?   If there's only one circuit then, I mean, that is so antithetical with the whole notion of the Federal rules that you don't plead evidence. Plain statement doesn't include evidence and it is guite an extreme interpretation and counter to the whole thrust of the Federal rules, which you make a plain statement and then the evidence comes later.   But this is -- this is a provision for removal. It tracks the language of Rule 8(a). And so you're asking for -- oh, even though it copies Rule 8(a), which certainly doesn't reguire that you plead evidence, we do have to do it for notice of removal.   If -- if the plaintiff wanted to challenge that, I could understand your position and then you would have the respective parties putting in their evidence. But if the defendant makes an allegation amount in controversy is met and the plaintiff doesn't say no, doesn't say that we don't have the amount in controversy.   But when you bring a class action, you're looking for big bucks and the likelihood that it's going to be controverted, that the plaintiff who's brought a class action in the State court is going to say, oh, no, we can't -- we can't make the amount in controversy, that sounds very strange to me. Most class action plaintiffs are not going to contest that their claim is worth at least $500,000.   Well, I don't follow that because ordinarily a plaintiff would state what the plaintiff's damages are.   In -- in the -- let's take a case in the Federal court, a class action case. Plaintiffs don't state what the amount in controversy is?   But you would say that all that the plaintiff would say is we meet the amount in controversy?   Where -- where was that said about conclusory? I thought that the district court's position was, sorry, you're too late; I won't entertain anything about 8.2 million or whatever it was.   Do I remember it wrong in -- in thinking that in your briefing you didn't raise this guestion? You just argued what the notice of removal must contain and it wasn't until there was one green brief Public Citizen that brought up this guestion. So you were content until a friend of the court made the suggestion to argue this case on the me r i t s.
13-7211 +++$+++    Cross-appeal when there's no appeal?   He could not have taken an appeal. Only the State could take an appeal; right?   Where does the statute or the rule talk about somebody who loses on a particular claim but wins the judgment, I thought -- I'm looking at the order. The order is on page 33 of the appendix and it doesn't say anything about Spisak or about -- what was the other one -- Wiggins. It just says the order is three choices, release him from custody or give him a new sentencing hearing or sentence him to a term in prison. That's it. That's the order that --   Let's get down to basics. Isn't it true that a judgment winner does not have to appeal an issue on which he lost but he is -- if he's content with the judgment, he can present arguments that would entitle him to relief. He can assert defensively. A judgment winner doesn't have to appeal, doesn't have to cross-appeal. That is the general rule; right?   But that's -- (c) (3) comes after (c)(1). And (c)(1) says you need a COA to appeal from the final order. And so if you don't need a COA to appeal from the final order, you go on and appeal from the final order. The final order is fine. You would never get to (c) (3) . (C)(3) says if you need a COA, then you will indicate which specific issues. But it doesn't -- (c)(3) doesn't tell you when you need a COA. (C)(1)(A) tells you that.   Where does that -- where does that come from in the statute? I mean, the statute says you need the COA to appeal from the final order in a habeas proceeding. Well -- in the final order. I don't want an appeal from the final order. It's good.   In fact, you get it from the language of the statute, which says you need a certificate to appeal from the final order.   Why doesn't this fit why doesn't this case just fit what is the standard rule that a party who's content with the judgment doesn't have to cross-appeal to preserve arguments that enabled him to retain the benefits of the judgment? That's the standard rule.
13-7451 +++$+++    Are you -- are you then saying that this is, indeed, a general statute against destroying anything that would impede a Federal --   But you did -- you did -- you did charge --   You charged two offenses 2232, and Yates is not guestioning the applicability of that. Is there any guidance that comes from Justice to prosecutors? I mean, the code is filled with overlapping offenses. So here's a case where the one statute has a 5-year maximum, the other 20. The one that has the 5-year clearly covers the situation. Is there anything in any kind of manual in the Department of Justice that instructs U.S. attorneys what to do when there are these overlapping statutes?   He said it has a stronger state of mind element.   You, in your brief, point to the Model Penal Code as the model for 1519. But the Model Penal Code describes a misdemeanor, and this is a 20-year felony. That seems kind of a mismatch.
13-854 +++$+++    Why do you reject what Mr. Jay tells us were also fact-findings?   I think you have just told us that the peak, that that's a fact-finding. But you don't accept the other two things that Mr. Jay characterized as fact-findings. Can you tell us why not?   Can we go -- can we go back to the question? If it's technical, it's all right for the judge to find the fact. I thought in our Seventh Amendment cases we have rejected the notion that if an issue is difficult, technical, the judge can decide it even though it's a fact.   The same way it's different from obviousness because the other side said, well, why shouldn't the fact law division for claim construction be the same as it is for obviousness.   You're talking about Skidmore.
13-894 +++$+++ 
13-895 +++$+++    And when you do that, will you also tell us what effect, if any, the preclearance should have.   Considerable evidence on the Senate District 26.   Let me ask you about this Section 5 mistake. Isn't it so that both the district court and Alabama were laboring under the impression that retrogression meant you have to keep the same numbers?   And if that's a misunderstanding of what Section 5 requires, then the whole thing is infected by that mistake.   What does it mean to comply with Section 5? And that's where you can say it strongly -- it complies -- everybody agrees that that counts, compliance with Section 5, strong interest in doing that. But if you think Section 5 means you got to preserve the same numbers and that's not what Section 5 means, then the whole premise on which the district court based its decision was wrong.
13-9026 +++$+++    Even the one step?
13-935 +++$+++    Who is the third party? You said it's just -- it's no different, no different than a third party coming in and saying that's my vote. Who is the third party here? And what --   There is only the trustee. This is supposed to be his mother's trust, and his sister is supposed to be the beneficiary, so who is the third party?   I thought she was dead.   Did she say, when she was alive, did she say, bankruptcy court, wait a minute, this belongs to me?
13-975 +++$+++    I thought you were taking the position, in answer to the government, that says you have to have it contemporaneous because of the 30 days that the company has to make up its mind whether to seek judicial review. But I think you made the suggestion, which I then put to counsel, that just have the 30 days run from when the reasons are available. So instead of having it run from when they send you a letter that says denied, treat that as not final until the reasons are given. I thought that was your position.
13-983 +++$+++    But I think Mr. Elwood disavowed that. He said he has to know that she will be in fear. He didn't --
13-9972 +++$+++    And what else -- what else besides -- we have the extraneous dog sniff. It doesn't relate to the traffic violation. What else? ( Could -- could the police say, I've taken the time I've needed to look into this traffic violation, but we're in a high crime neighborhood, so I'd like to keep this driver a bit longer so I can just interrogate him about what other things he might have been doing. And it's not going to take -- it's only going to take eight minutes. But traffic stop, you've taken care of that. And now instead of having the dog come, the police officer says, I have a few guestions I want to ask you.   So you say that --   You told me the officer could do that. At least that's what I understood your answer to be.
14-103 +++$+++    Mr. Oldham, why aren't they all tied together so you recognize that the application for the fee is compensable?   It's like the opening pleading. Then the objection is the answer to the application, and then the response to the objection is the -- the defense of it. It seems to me it's -- it's all one package, that it -- the application, and there's an answer to the application, and then there's a reply. It -- why don't those three things go together?
14-114 +++$+++    So are you saying one person does have standing?   Well, you -- would you send it back then to -- to the district court?   How long has it taken --
14-15 +++$+++    How about 1983? Do you agree that there's no 1983 claim here?   What about if --   In this case -- in this case there is a puzzle based on the district court's determination. (30)(A) is what you're relying on and it requires sufficient -- all that, sufficient to enlist enough providers. According to the district court, all eligible recipients received the services that they needed. So again, there was no waiting list; nobody's being kept waiting. These providers, while they say they're not getting enough, are still providing the service. So where is the 30(A) violation?   But if you look at this and say, well, the service was efficient, it was economical, quality care, and it enlisted enough providers.   Do you agree -- do you agree that -- with your brother that -- that C -- CMS could have gotten this injunctive -- could have gone into court and said, they told us this is their method, they didn't follow it, court enjoin them from not following the method?   Does CMS routinely -- and do Federal agencies that have this Draconian power -- do they in fact -- are there in fact fund cutoffs? I mean, the reality is that a fund cutoff hurts everybody; the recipients don't get the benefits, the providers don't get money for the services they rendered. So it's a theoretically very powerful remedy, but practically it's never used as far as I know.
14-86 +++$+++    Are the what? Group?   Except in Title VII, you would be right if all that Title VII did was prevent religious discrimination, but it makes a religious practice, a refusal to accommodate a religious practice is itself a violation of Title VII. So we have -- it's -- and that was done deliberately, was it not, so that religious practices would have to be accommodated.   That's if the employee knows the rule. But here the employee had no reason to think that there was anything offensive about her dress. How can she say, by the way, I have a religious reason for wearing this headscarf, when from everything, from ( all appearances, the employer doesn't care. It's okay to wear a headscarf. Then the employer has not given her notice of this Look Policy, so how is she supposed to in -- in -- intrude the question, that as far as all appearances go, it's fine, that she's wearing a headscarf. There's no Look Policy that the employee knows that's violated.   Did she testify that she knew they had a dress code? I was not aware of that.   But she did. In fact, she came in with an Abercrombie type shirt, right?   She did not mention the headscarf?   Okay, but there was no mention of a headscarf in what she read.   Or a yamulke. He said specifically, somebody come in, applies for a job, wears a yamulke, no questions asked, that violates our policy. That was his testimony.   We've already gone through this. All I have to do is say, This is what our Look Policy is, do you have any problem with it? As Justice Alito pointed out a while back, don't have to probe anything about religion. I thought Ms. -- what is his name, Johnson -- when he said, I would do the same thing with a man who came in with a yamulke. So the man who came in with the yamulke got the same treatment. Sorry, I was, I was -- Ms. Cooke, I would want to hire you, but I can't. That was the answer that he gave. So there's no difference between the headscarf or yamulke or a Sikh turban in Mr. Johnson's view.   If it's going to be a requirement for the job, then doesn't the employer have an obligation to tell the employee what the job requirements are?   Why would they ask anything about nonreligious? Title VII doesn't require accommodating baseball caps, but it does require accommodating to religious practices. So the employer is not -- as I said before, it's not just, I can't discriminate on the basis of religion, but if there's a religious practice, I must accommodate it as a discrete requirement.   So why would that be so when you just said they don't require people at the interview stage to conform to the Look Policy?   They -- Title VII requires them to treat people who have religious practice differently. They don't have to accommodate a baseball cap. They do have to accommodate a yarmulke.
