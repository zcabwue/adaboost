04-1034 +++$+++         But your -- your theory is there is regulatory authority because there's an interaction between the wetlands or the lands in question and the navigable waters.             Well, but -- but wasn't -- wasn't the reason for including the adjacent wetlands because of -- of the likelihood of an interaction?             Well, let -- well, please finish.        Your assumption --        -- but this -- this is preliminary to my question.             In SWANCC, we said there has to be a significant nexus.               It seems to me that you have to show that there's some significant relation between the wetlands you're regulating or seeking to regulate and the navigable water.        And I -- and that's just, it seemed to me, so far been missing from the discussion.        What -- what about the Chief Justice's question, wetlands next to wetlands?        But the Congress in 1972 also, in its statement of policy, said it's a statement of policy to reserve to the States the power and the responsibility to plan land use and water resources. And under your definition, I -- I just see that we're giving no scope at all to that clear statement of a congressional policy.
04-10566 +++$+++           Can you tell us what the State of Oregon has done in this regard --          -- or other States?          Well, how do you think it should -- you think the police officer should give it as part of the Miranda warnings, or what's -- what's your conclusion as to how it should be implemented?        Does this mean that the -- the desk sergeant in the police station or who?             So you think it's -- it's not -- it's not required for police interrogators in the station to include this?                    They can -- they can wait?             Well, how about during the interrogation?             I mean, it seems to me it's not like rocket science.                 You've had study groups and everything.              Well, you just tell the policemen give them -- give them the advice.                    End of case.             Well, that's easy.   If you are a foreign national, you -- that's easy too.                   I don't -- I don't see why this is so complicated.             That's their problem.        Your answer -- your answer doesn't give me confidence that you're implementing the treaty.         In your view, just as a practical matter, what we have here, how -- how should the States enforce this obligation?         Do they have any obligation to inquire whether he is?             And -- and can you be more specific?         Should it happen --         -- when you first give him the Miranda warnings, or tell me how you think it should work?         Do you think they have the affirmative obligation to ask him if he is a foreign national?        Well, I thought you indicated that you advise the States that they do have to advise him of this right during the booking process or the interrogation.
04-1067 +++$+++          Now, any reason to believe --         -- but --         -- you can't enter without probable cause.         And that's a -- with exigent circumstances.         Suppose you have suspicions of a domestic problem that's ongoing.                      It's short of probable cause, but you have reasonable suspicion.          Does that alter the nonconsenting party's interest and elevate the consenting party's interest?
04-1084 +++$+++            But you seem to give the fact that it's listed in Schedule 1 zero weight.                   It seems to me, at the very least, there should be a presumption that this is a compelling interest.           And when the -- and when the evidence is in equipoise, as the district judge thought it would, that presumption, it seems to me, carries the day for the Government.       But, surely --       -- surely RFRA doesn't say that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in determining what's a compelling interest.       And getting back to the first question that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off on what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance -- assuming that -- is there any evidence that the District Court thought that this was a compelling interest?       None at all.       So, if we disagree with you on the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't really even address the point whether or not this and/or the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.
04-1131 +++$+++         But I m -- I m not sure what the congressional intent would be to bifurcate the constitutional and the statutory claims, especially if they re the same thing.          Well, that s what -- that s what you re asking us to say.          But if -- if -- under -- under your explanation of how the system works, you go to district court with a constitutional claim.                  He s -- he -- the district court doesn t have to reach the statutory claim first?          Well, that s what I mean. This is a very odd system where you have to immediately go to the constitutional claim and you re foreclosed from looking at the statutory claim.        In -- in those circuits which allow these cases to go to courts, has there been any indication that the courts are flooded with a number of these cases or --
04-1140 +++$+++         Have the lower courts addressed that issue?        Are there -- are there instances, under your view of the statute, in -- under the standard you propose, where costs would be awarded, but not fees?        And, once --        -- again, can you advise us of their practice or lower-court opinions addressing that issue?            Because we think of costs as really a matter of course.                        As Justice Scalia points out, it says "just costs," which -- I take it "just" modifies just the cost and not the actual --
04-1144 +++$+++               Suppose I am concerned that the record doesn't explain to me one way or the other whether or not your and the medical profession's definition of immediate allows time to make one telephone call to a judge.          Well, there can be nurses or attendants that can get the judge on the line.          Well, I've looked at those procedures and it seems to me that those are interpreted as what should happen in the ordinary case.       They certainly don't preclude making a phone call and there can be phone calls for warrants in criminal cases in New Hampshire.                 That's specifically provided.           The problem was, it seems to me, that the bypass procedure can go a long way toward saving this statute, but this was not litigated in the trial courts.                 We don't know what New Hampshire's position is going to be.                      We don't know what the facts are.          The purpose is to save the statute which has thousands of applications that are valid.          But that's what happened and you're here defending that judgment.
04-1152 +++$+++          What --         What you're --         What you're arguing is that what is, for all intents and purposes, "conduct" can be infused by the school, at its option, with a first- amendment quality.         Yet your argument would allow schools to exclude anybody in uniform from a cafeteria.        Why not?        What's the point?        It's an express -- it's an -- it's solely for an expressive purpose.            And so for members --            -- for medical schools, we can't get medical schools for our Armed Forces -- chaplains, the same way, because it -- schoolteachers who teach on military bases -- in order to make the point.            And that's --        -- that's all for an expressive reason.        What's happening here is the perspective employers, the recruiters, are proposing a commercial transaction.                    And it seems to me quite a simple matter for the law schools to have a disclaimer on all of their e-mails and advertisements that say, "The law school does not approve -- and, in fact, disapproves -- of the policies of some of the employers who you will meet."        That's the end of it.        Do law schools have an interest in the Constitution that other people don't?        All right.      Well, I --        -- I suppose, under your view, law schools really shouldn't permit firms -- law firms on campus if those firms, say, oppose -- take litigation positions opposing gay marriage.        That's --        That's your position.        Your position is, the schools could, and probably should, do that to make their message known.        Even with reference to commercial -- proposed commercial transactions?
04-1170 +++$+++           Well, that's because the defendant hasn't introduced enough evidence of mitigation and that's the duty of the defendant to come forward with it.          Well, you say it's a state of indecision.           The jury has decided that aggravating factors have been established.          Why isn't it a reliable determination that, number one, it's a death-qualified accused in -- in any event, and there have been specific aggravators proved?                 That has been determined. It's now for the defendant, in effect, to show that the mitigating circumstances outweigh this.                The -- and you have the bonus that the State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators have not outweighed the aggravators.        They have made the decision.         They have made the decision that the aggravators are there and have not been outweighed. They have made that decision.        That's because the mitigation case hasn't been made.             Well, it's terminating it because there's not enough mitigating evidence.             Well, but in the case before us, the court -- the Kansas court said -- I think it's 24 or 25 of the -- of the headnote -- we are reconsidering the issue.        And made a reasoned judgment about it.        Well, they reopened it to the extent as Justice Scalia has indicated, but they now take a different view of the validity of the State statute.        That's -- that's a decision following a reason, and the reason is a Federal reason.
04-1186 +++$+++ 
04-1203 +++$+++         And I'm saying this to help you.      I'd love to get reason two.            I'm wondering -- [Laughter.]
04-1244 +++$+++ 
04-1264 +++$+++ 
04-1324 +++$+++ 
04-1327 +++$+++           But quite apart from that, it seems to me that the statement is questionable as an empirical matter.         Why is it that forensic evidence somehow should be used to exclude third party guilt evidence as -- as a universal proposition?              Maybe in some cases yes, maybe in some -- but this is a universal proposition.        Well, if I were the trial court, in a subsequent case in South Carolina, I would -- I would have to read this instruction of the South Carolina Supreme Court as saying I simply could not admit this evidence when there's forensic evidence. And that's a very strange proposition.          Suppose there had been evidence that the time of death testimony had been contrived, planted, fabricated.                    Then what?   Or suppose that was the allegation of the defense.           But there is a dispute here as to the forensic evidence.               The suggestion is it's planted.
04-1329 +++$+++             Well, except that the -- the Chief -- Chief Justice's question -- and it -- it's the same question as Justice Souter had and is what concerns me.             My -- my understanding -- and it's not an understanding based on any experience litigating in this area -- is that when you hire economists, in order to establish market power, this is a substantial undertaking.             It's -- it's a significant part of litigation costs.            And what you're saying is that this is an important rule so that we -- we vindicate the important rule by putting the presumption on -- on the defendant.          But you can say that with many important rules in many other areas.
04-1332 +++$+++            But what -- what significance do you give to the word to complete, as to whether it's a complete bar?                 Doesn't that indicate that the -- the statute is -- is a bar to all -- all further actions after a judgment?            Yes, but the petitioners requested it.             Did -- did you oppose that request below?        Yes.     I -- I thought -- I thought the district court said I'm going to deny the motion to certify because the issue is clear in my view, but if you think you have a collateral order doctrine, then go ahead and take your appeal.
04-1350 +++$+++                It looks like Dystar was decided by the Federal Circuit after it decided this case, didn't it?               I mean, you have to be defending what the Federal Circuit did in this case. And the fact that they say well now, what this means is really in some other case, that seems to me that's really irrelevant.               And I think you should tell us when the case has been decided after, I think it has much less, much less weight.                Yes, but your -- the Federal Circuit is saying that, the gist of it is if and only if the previous patents taught this.                    But you, you can look at these two devices, and you're a good mechanic, you've never seen a patent, you've never read these patents, you've never read these claims, you've never been to the Supreme Court, and you put them together.               And the Federal Circuit said oh, it's not in the patent, it's not obvious.             Well then, in this case let's assume that we all strike out on coming out with the magic formulation.        One of the ways the law progresses is we go from case to case, and in this case you have two standards of operation.                     One is a pedal that basically operates by pressure.                     The other -- and by levers.    Other is by electronics, and these are two different methods of making the carburetor release the fuel.    So why not, so somebody combines them.                   Why is that such a big deal as, as claim 4 says it is. Certainly this inventor would not be the only one to think that the two could and should be combined.
04-1360 +++$+++ 
04-1371 +++$+++          Can you tell me, do you agree that a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?         But what about enforcement actions taken by the --         -- SEC?        But then, the --        -- then it does fall within -- holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.        So, you want us to interpret the text two ways, depending on the purpose.
04-1376 +++$+++              And --             And the executive couldn't weigh that.              You say, categorically, it -- there's no - -             -- no possibility for discretion.             Well, could the -- could the INS have just stayed its hand for -- in --             No.        Do you read the Tenth Circuit opinion as indicated it might have had a different result if he had been married before the enactment of the statute?        How does that fit with the court's theory?        Yes.        How does it --
04-1414 +++$+++ 
04-1477 +++$+++           This is the FedEx rule of due process.          This is the FedEx rule of due process. (Laughter.)           Can --        Is it of any --        Is it of any relevance to consider the burden or the obligations this rule that petitioners advocate place on downstream purchasers?
04-1495 +++$+++           Have there been cases where in the context of the prosecution, there's been a motion to dismiss the prosecution because it was brought in retaliation for the exercise of the First Amendment right?        Have there been cases in the other courts?        My -- my question was directed to the First Amendment.          Yick Wo.          Yick Wo.          Let -- let me ask you this. Suppose the law enforcement official -- the postal inspectors bring the prosecution to the prosecutor because of their disagreement with his First Amendment views.       The prosecutor said, I don't care about the First Amendment views.           I'm glad you brought this to me.     I'm going to prosecute because there's probable cause here and this is a bad actor.                   What results?        That's why --        Suppose the prosecutor said, you shouldn't have brought this to me because you -- you're -- you're motivated by the First Amendment. But now that it's here, I have my own independent interest in going ahead.          Now, that -- that means one of two things:         either what you're arguing for is not going to bring a flood of litigation, or everyone has assumed that probable cause is a -- is a requirement.        Well, but -- but I'm not sure that that proposition has been established in the cases.          No, no.      But the point remains that if in the prosecutorial context that the immunity exists whether or not there's a constitutional violation, then that teaches us that the same rule should apply to this case.               That was Justice Scalia's --
04-1506 +++$+++              Do you think under Arkansas law that the injured party as an assignor has a duty to cooperate with the assignee in pursuing the claim?             Is that duty fulfilled by -- by entering settlement negotiations and not even notifying the assignee?        Well, but what you're saying is that there's no duty to notify the assignee if you think you might get a pretty good result for yourself.         I don't understand that as much of -- much of a duty.        Well, it certainly would have avoided about 20 minutes of questions in this Court. (Laughter.)
04-1527 +++$+++               So, what's --              So, what's the definition - - what's the general definition that you're giving us that describes this result you've given?              It --              It is a discharge, because a "discharge" means what?
04-1528 +++$+++           -- it seems to me that this is a highly restrictive rule insofar as having the campaign be able to address the issues that the voters say that they've become interested in.          Well, I suppose the Vermont courts could construe it more narrowly at some later point.       I would hate to rest the opinion on that.
04-1544 +++$+++           Well, you say -- you say an -- an estate plan.         Most people would think insurance policies are part of their estate plan, and if it's alleged that there was a fraudulent alteration of the beneficiary designation in the insurance policies, is that within the Texas probate court jurisdiction?          Well, there's -- there's a further irony here in that revocable trusts are always promoted on the grounds that it keeps us out of probate.         And now you're -- you're insisting that it has to be in probate.          Well, but as Justice Breyer indicated, can't you just, for purposes of understanding the cause of action as asserted by Vickie Marshall here, just say, we will assume the trust is valid, we will assume the will is valid?                 All we're saying was that there's a tort and he's going to be liable to us in tort.
04-1581 +++$+++         I -- I beg your pardon.          I didn't hear the names of the cases.        Well, it might have been that 90 feet included a public street and you couldn't go down a public street without -- so -- and so --        It -- it does seems strange to me in a speech case to say we're foreclosing as- applied challenges.        So you think there is a compelling interest in preventing people from thinking about an issue and then calling their Senator during the blackout period.         That's the compelling interest that, in effect, you are arguing for.        Are -- are Web sites and chat rooms covered by the MCCain-Feingold?        But certainly under your view, they ought to be.           If you funded a Web site which was very popular or a chat room, I certainly think it should come within your proscription so that we can't talk about issues during an election.        Well, why -- why not? Suppose -- suppose most people look at the Web site and they don't listen to the -- listen to the radio.               I think certainly MCCain-Feingold should be extended to that under your view.        General --        And they -- and they could have -- they could have named Senator Kohl, I take it.        It's such an odd calculus. Who is the person more likely to be influenced with an issue ad?         The person who's running or the person who's not going to run for 4 years?              Obviously, the former.        And that's -- and that's the one area where the ad is prohibited.            So you do -- you do an ideological history, an ideological pedigree of various speakers.         You think that's consistent with the First Amendment?          That -- that was the ACLU's suggestion which, it seems to me, shows you how far we've gone down this road.           And -- and the difference -- the difference is this is a content-based inquiry.
04-1618 +++$+++ 
04-1704 +++$+++         Did the case use the phrase "capable of repetition and evading review," or -- which is a mootness --        I just have to read Craig --        -- on the --
04-1739 +++$+++         Well -- well, it seems to me that that's an as-applied challenge.                If -- if a particular inmate -- the terms of -- the conditions of confinement are particularly harsh and he -- he or she has an unrealistic opportunity to get to a less restrictive confinement, then -- then he can bring a suit.           But -- but -- the whole rationale of your case -- if I were you writing your brief, I would have this problem.                   This really matters to the inmates, but that's exactly the State's point. That's the reason it's taken away.                    It really means something.          And I -- I just -- I just don't know what to do with that conundrum.           And -- and it seems to me it's the heart of your case and that it surfaces here in the answers you've attempted to give.           But the whole basis for the suit is that it matters to the prisoner, and that's exactly why it's been taken away because there's nothing else left that we can do with these prisoners.         But -- but the State's position is that it wants to avoid that ultimate deterrent.          It -- it wants to take away privileges for a while to see if he can conform.                 You're depriving the State of the -- of the option to avoid the most extreme circumstances of forgetting about him altogether forever.         And it seems to me that -- that your -- your argument is -- is at cross ends with its own purpose.
04-373 +++$+++        Of course, that factor --       -- can work the other way.          You would be up here, saying, "Oh, he had 24 hours.                   He thought he was going to get the death penalty.             He knew the other man was turning on him to implicate him in the murder.                His agony was increasing."         I mean, I -- it seems to me the question is whether or not the curative measures were adequate.       Of course, you know, we can play the game -- 5 minutes, 20 minutes --       -- 30 minutes.     We know that. But, it seems to me, when 30 minutes passed here, there were curative measures.         Now, you say, at the outset, there can never be a -- curative measures.               That -- I don't think you have anything to -- any support for that in the case law.      Suppose --      -- suppose, again, we do not accept that position.         You need another fallback position in our -- in order to argue the case before us.      Well, Johns --      -- Johns, in effect, did that here.      Certainly, one of the best curative devices is immediate correction from a superior.               And that is exactly what happened here.      So, you think you'd have a stronger case if Johns hadn't corrected Reese?      That's --      But --      -- that's a --      -- far stretch.     It's --       The right direction would be to say, "Please don't talk to us."          And what the Chief Justice says was true in Bradshaw and in Edwards and in Elstad.          All questions, which were mixed questions of law and fact, where this Court took the words, took the facts, and made a rule.                 And that's this case.        Can you tell us --        -- where you're reading from?       And the -- and the Court of Appeals of Maryland said, "We're going to look at this in the legal sense, not the dictionary sense."       And that's what we're reviewing here.          But there is no finding to support the suggestion that it was just the death penalty that concerned him.             He was also concerned, I thought, about the fact that his accomplice, Tolbert, had implicated him, and --          -- presumably implicated him           --          -- too far.       So is --          There's just no finding that it was simply the death penalty that --          And --          -- his concern with Tolbert was a wholly legitimate reason for him to want to talk to the police and --       -- get things straightened away right away.       Well --       -- absent of good-cop/bad-cop finding, and I -- and I repeat that they've credited Johns' testimony here -- this seems to me a very odd sort of interrogation, to say, "No, no, you -- we can't talk to him now."     That's an interrogation?          That's a stretch.

04-473 +++$+++         Well, I'm not sure that that was clear from the decisions of this Court.                Certainly, that wasn't what was involved in Pickering.                That was outside speech.           And the same -- and the same with Connick.             So, I'm -- if you're saying that this is what the circuits have understood, fine, but that's not this -- that's why we took this case.           Well, let's assume that --           -- I think that that's an open question under Pickering, and that this case presents it. Do you -- do you concede -- and maybe you don't -- that there is any category of first amendment speech, as a matter of public concern, which an employee cannot direct to the employer?             Are there -- are there some matters as to which the employer can protect its own interests and stifle the employee's speech?            So, there's always Pickering balance.        But --        -- any comment that an employee makes regarding how the office is working is a matter of public concern.            I would concede that.     I mean --        -- that has to be.        And the consequence of your view is to have the first amendment being used for courts to monitor the discussions that take place in every public agency -- local, State, and Federal -- in the United States.       It's -- you are advocating a sweeping rule.           Now, you'll say, "Oh, well, Pickering balance will protect it."          But I still think the intrusive consequences of your -- of your rule are sweeping.        But I don't under- --        -- I understand the ultimate answer you gave the hypothetical.                I don't understand the principle you're following.              I mean, it's a matter of --          -- you would agree this is a matter of public concern.          But we don't have a standard.         So, the Federal --         -- Federal courts supervise the constant dialogue that is the everyday routine practice in every governmental agency, local and Federal, in the United States.             Well, in --             -- in this case, the supervisor said, "There can't be -- can't be tracks on asphalt, so you're probably right."                         Then he finds out that it's a tire rim, and of course the rim makes a -- so we have to find out this at discovery -- at the discovery stage of a lawsuit?            What --            -- what you're saying is, is that the first amendment has an office and a function within the confines of a Government agency that it doesn't have outside.             That's a curious calculus.          It seems to me that the first amendment has its most application when you talk to newspapers, when you talk outside.                     That's what the first amendment's about.                  The first amendment isn't about policing the workplace.        So, we do this --        -- so we do this as a -- so we do this as a matter of what is sound management principles for a Government agency?            How does that relate to the first amendment?          Well, that --          There would -- in this case, unlike any other case I've seen in the employment area, there is a hearing in -- before a court of general jurisdiction, who goes into this.                  That's what the criminal trial is for.            And he did.            There was also a grievance proceeding.
04-52 +++$+++            Well, what -- what should happen if the trial judge doesn t see it and a counsel, who s observant, said, judge, I ve got a problem with this juror?              I don t know that the trial judge has to -- has to see it, if he believes the counsel.             We ve -- we ve all been -- been in court and -- and noticed that sometimes witnesses or jurors or parties or even attorneys will make faces and so forth that s not consistent with -- with proper demeanor in a courtroom.             Maybe the judge is reading. A judge doesn t watch -- watch the witness 100 percent of the time.              That s not credible.        Now -- now, number 19 was excused and was a black person.        And -- and a woman.      And if that too had been suspicious and challenged, then you might have had a pattern, a pattern of two people, which could have overcome the demeanor testimony -- demeanor claim. But I -- I think on this record that we have to assume that there is nothing wrongful about excusing juror 19 merely because respondent s counsel here -- you did not pursue that.            I -- I read the record as -- as telling us that so far as juror 19 is concerned, there was an adequate reason for excusing that juror. At least respondent s counsel -- you have not said that there wasn t.        Well, but number 6 was a young white -- young white male, I believe, and he was excused on the ground of youth.               So it s consistent.           Would you say the same thing about the defense counsel confusing jurors 16 and 19 on page 9?            The bottom of page 9, it seems to me Ms. -- Ms. Nachman is confusing juror 19 with 16.                  They re talking about 16 and 6, and then Ms. Nachman ends by talking about juror 19.              That seems to me clearly to mean number 16.           Well, I -- I don t think it s a necessary reading.        In -- in a sense, the standards perhaps ought to be reversed.                When you hear the evidence, which is what you do under (e)(1), that is when you ve determined -- should determine whether it s unreasonable.        You should presume that it s correct before you decide whether you re going to hear. So you could argue that they should be --        If -- if I might ask.         You have no objection to our unsealing the joint appendix, volume 2.        Thank you.
04-593 +++$+++            Are you referring to Runyon, for instance?             The parents always had a special relation to the child.              It's something of a stretch to say that the corporation has that same relation with its own shareholder.        There's no doubt he's the target.        That's the --

04-607 +++$+++ 
04-623 +++$+++         The statute gives the Attorney General authority to promulgate regulations for the dispensing of drug -- 821 -- and that seems to me to describe precisely what the Attorney General has done here.        Well, it seems to me --        -- very odd to have a regulation on dispensing that takes no account of the purpose for which the drug is being used.       Well, but I give --       -- you a statutory reference, and then you tell me about something else.
04-631 +++$+++          I think we can --            -- I think we can decide it on the basis that we know that when the distributor puts -- delivers gas to the gas station, it's not instantly sold. I mean, even we know that.        Is it relevant --        -- to the balancing test --            Why should all of that make a difference?           You make a big point in the briefing, "Well, you're not marketing the exemption, you're taxing, you're using" -- if the -- if the tribe does have the sovereign right to tax or not to tax, why can't it use it not to tax at all and say, "We're giving" -- why is there a presumption in favor of imposing taxes?                     Why can't the tribe say, "We're not going to tax you if you come to the reservation.              Come on in and buy our gas.         No tax"?            Why isn't -- why isn't that part of the tribal sovereign right?       And I just don't --       -- understand.      Why doesn't the tribe have an incidence of not having any tax at all, helping --       -- helping its members?       Why does the balancing only work if it taxes?       No, no, no.      You say that it could --       -- market the exemption?       You say that a tribe can market its exemption?         Well, why isn't that sovereign interest in not taxing?
04-698 +++$+++         Well --        -- to the -- to the extent that we're concerned about unnecessarily increasing costs on school districts, and burdens on school districts, why shouldn't we have a uniform Federal rule?                In other words, if we agree with your position that ordinary allocations puts this on the complainant, we have to conserve resources, and so forth, why should we allow States to have a different rule, when we're dealing with the administration of a Federal program?        -- there hasn't been finding of any violation by the school district.                     The school district --        But I -- but I'm interested in --        -- I'm interested in Justice Ginsburg's question.          Let's assume you show a violation. Is there -- is there any law on who has the burden of showing that the remedy is sufficient?        But when I ask --        You're asking about the --        -- about the -- wait a minute. Let's say that the -- we find that there's a violation.
04-712 +++$+++  
04-721 +++$+++            I missed it.    You said the problem is, California doesn't "support" or "import"? I just didn't --           -- hear your word.           I -- the -- I just didn't hear what you said.           Enforce.        And this could be --        -- just one point, if I may, Justice Breyer -- those are the California Supreme Court or California appellate court?        Thank you.
04-759 +++$+++         But we can remand for that. What's here is, the Ninth Circuit held that there's liability based on what the liability of a State agent would be, and that's just not the rule.         So, we have to give some instructions as to how the -- as to whether or not the Ninth Circuit is right about that.         And that's why you're here.
04-805 +++$+++              But I don't -- I don't understand, Mr. Alioto, if the profits are -- are not traceable to how much of -- of the two products are sold, if the profits aren't divided that way, why should the two lines be continued to be marketed independently?           There's no other analog I can think of in -- in the business world for that.                      There -- there's no motive to make one any cheaper than the other once the profits are shared evenly, and that's the structure of the venture.
04-848 +++$+++        Well, suppose you have a big crate that the postman uses, because you've been away for a week and yet the mail -- and he leaves a crate there, and you trip on the crate.            Under your view, there would be liability, because the crate's like the -- the crate isn't the mail.       Well, how is mail- --       -- mail-specific any different than the grocery boy -- I mean, than the grocery-specific, under your view?       But you're --       But you're saying -- you're -- you want us to say that mail is somehow unique.                  But it isn't.        There's all kinds of delivery.       But I'm saying --       -- it's not mail-specific, because all delivery people have the same problem.            So, why is it mail-specific?            Well, let --            -- let me ask you about defenses.          And it goes a little bit beyond the suit, but, as I -- I read through the regulations, and it's the duty of the occupant, or the recipient, of the mail to provide a box or a letter slot or something.                    Would the failure to do that, so that they just have to put it on the porch -- is that a defense?        Let's assume there's liability.        Let's assume that your interpretation of the statute does not prevail here.                      Does the Post Office have a defense if the person doesn't provide a mailbox, as the regulations require?        Is --        Are there --        Are there regulations requiring that the mail be put in a reasonably safe place? And by that, I mean reasonably safe for the occupant, not reasonably safe for the mail.             You -- because you quote -- you quote, on page 2, the footnote -- you quote the regulation.           But I read that, that it has to be reasonably safe for the mail, because it says, "Oh, you can leave it on a stairway or under a porch, just so long as it's safe for the mail."              That's the way I read that one.             Well, I guess my point --             -- my point is, if there's a duty, then it seems to me the Post Office is used to making these judgments.                 And if it does not make the correct judgment, it can be sued.           I'm not saying --           -- that you're creating a cause of action.           I'm just saying that you're not --           -- that much different than any institution faced with slip-and-fall cases.            Yes, but you're --            -- you're using the word "deliver," but the statutory word is "transmit."                   And -- are there other statutes or regulations in respect to the Post Office that talk about "delivery"?            Is the word -- because it seems to me -- the omission of "delivery," it seems to me, is a real problem for you, in your theory of the case.       But that does --       -- but the person who trips doesn't say, "Oh, this really hurts me because it's mail instead of a box of oranges," does he?
04-881 +++$+++        Well, but then -- but then, in -- you know, you know what's coming.                   You -- the provision you rely on is 3116, and it's stuck into the middle of this -- of a provision which requires written notice, opportunity to inspect records, and so forth.                   All those apply.        But you have to say that (e) doesn't apply.         And it says -- and it says "offsets under this section."
04-885 +++$+++        Take your time.    We're interested --           Well, it's the same question.        But let's say that the court thinks there might be merit to the argument of waiver, that the State entity comes in asking to be treated as a creditor, and its preference is then before the bankruptcy court.            How is that issue preserved in the question you raise?        You say, maybe the Congress used Article 1 to abrogate the State's sovereign immunity.           It just seems to -- seem to me to be part of the question presented.           Well, you asked -- you framed the question.           Oh, no, you -- you're right. You're right.             You're exactly right.          And the proof of claim in VMI was $43,000, and the preference was $25,000.
04-8990 +++$+++          But -- but isn't there also evidence that the spillage in the Styrofoam container seemed to be inadequate to account for all of the blood that was missing from the vial?         Well, but that's important for this whole question.             Quantity relates to chain of custody.        But there was a finding that it was in the course of the rape.        That was part of that. That was -- that was one of the -- was it one of three aggravating circumstances?        It was found at the guilt phase or the trial phase, the aggravating circumstance?        Well, then at -- at a minimum, it seems to me that the sentencing phase is -- is in question by that. But also, it seems to me if I were a juror and was faced with these conflicting things, I would look for motive.        But -- but the semen was used to -- to connect it to the -- to the defendant, and we now know that that's wrong.
04-905 +++$+++            Well, in fact --           -- you almost have to show that. But the evidence of the head-to-head competition, it seems to me, too insubstantial to support liability here.                  Would you agree?      I -- and I --           -- I -- your opposing counsel says you almost concede that, right?
04-928 +++$+++            I don't understand that answer, in light of the previous discussion about the deliberate -- deliberately.           Did the Oregon courts take the position that, in the sentencing phase, the "deliberately" requirement must be judged just by what was in -- introduced in the guilt phase?           But I thought that --           -- you told us additional evidence on deliberation can be put in the -- in the sentencing phase.        But then you're saying that you're not going to do that.
04-944 +++$+++ 
04-9728 +++$+++         I have one --        I have one --        I have --          But not the consent --        -- not the consent approach, I take it.           I didn't get an opportunity to ask the counsel who argued just previously.                Seemed to me that he argued consent when he answered Justice Stevens's question about the tax-evader.                But he argued the overwhelming practical needs when he argued the rest of the case.        And I thought I saw some tension in the argument there.         And I take it the Government does not embrace the consent argument?        But you --        -- just --        -- put it in number --        -- you put it --        -- in number three?        In --             But in your view, if the consent was straightforward in the documents, would that be the strongest argument or the weakest argument?             I mean, I take you'll win on any --             -- argument --             -- you can take.         The Government -- is the Government of the United States somewhat behind the State of California?           It's not efficient in -- as efficient as California in supervising its parolees? Because you don't have this rule.
04-980 +++$+++              But it's not -- it's prefaced by circumstances of the crime.             And this State, and other States, can determine, "Oh, the victim was in fear for a long time, or was tortured."                   It seems very odd that a State, which is a so-called "non-weighing" State, could allow all of this same evidence to come in, but California, which tries to give some structure, is suddenly held to a higher standard.                  That's paradoxical.         Of course, it's -- it's invalid only because it's too vague for eligibility.                It's not invalid because it's too vague for selection.        Do you -- do you defend that the difference in -- our distinction between balancing and non-balancing -- or, pardon me, "weighing" and "non- weighing" States -- your answer to Justice Breyer indicates the -- that you would not be disconsolate if we jettisoned the whole -- the whole distinction.                And isn't it true that it's paradoxical that a State which tries to structure the selection phase by giving specific factors as held to a higher standard than a State that doesn't? That seems to me very odd.            But it is within the contours of the Constitution if, in a "non-weighing" State, the same evidence could be considered.        In that --        -- analysis, would you use, as one factor, the circumstance that an eligibility determination was made by the jury, was focused on by the prosecutor, and that that was impermissibly vague?               Would that be a component of your harmless-error analysis?        Would it be a --        Well, we have the rule, already, that if there is an invalid eligibility factor and it's a "weighing" State, that there's -- that the process is defective.           Would you carry over that same argument just as one component of the harmless-error analysis?       But that was the whole basis -- correct me if I'm wrong -- for the Ninth Circuit's case in your -- Ninth Circuit decision in your favor in this case.       In this case, it certainly --       -- is an accurate description of --       -- what the rule is.       Well, I --       -- I was just asking if we can import the same formal rule we now have and reach -- and -- if we don't consider the same things in harmless-error analysis.
05-1056 +++$+++               But suppose, suppose you had a machine that makes another machine, and if you ship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for the machine that makes it.          If you ship it to Europe and it starts making another machine, the statute is not violated; and isn't that just what's happening here?              Well, is it an answer to Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no conceptual problem saying there would be liability if this happened within the territorial limits of the United States?              And so there shouldn't be a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying it abroad.
05-1074 +++$+++                  But suppose he has no intent to discriminate as a present matter, but he also knows that his decision is necessarily based on a policy that was discriminatory some years ago. What result?                 He knows it, but his present decision is necessarily based on some prior decision that was discriminatory.                 How is that -- how is that consistent with the statement in Bazemore that the employer has a duty to eradicate past discrimination?
05-1120 +++$+++               Your problem, I think, you take the position, the proposition that the greater the harm the greater the risk, the smaller the probability has to be before it is reasonable to act, and necessary to act.               In Norton versus Utah Wilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its action.
05-1126 +++$+++               Now you're reading from the Swierkiewicz brief?              No.    His hypothetical is all you've done is to allege the final sentence without the preceding clause, the five or six lines before there's a comma.         That's out.              All there is is the allegation of the conspiracy.                 Is that enough in this case?              No.    The hypothetical is without the preceding clause.              Is that enough --              Is that enough in this case for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are interested in the answer that you make given this complaint in this case that we are faced with.
05-11284 +++$+++               But you see, in Johnson the Court was confronted with the special issues and it makes the assumption based on the State's representation there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a jury to fully consider this.           What has happened in these cases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep reminding the jury you just must answer special issues one and two as given.     And in the Cole case they say, even though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a kid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your mind, and just go by the special issues.               And that's the concern in these cases.              But that's because the issues confined him to that.              Were these decisions post-Johnson.              And what's the Texas case that says that?              Well, did we say that in the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of childhood abuse and so forth?              Or was it really applied just in the context of the Graham evidence?             Right.          But the answer to Justice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can only consider it in the, in the context of deliberateness or future dangerousness.               Can you tell me, if you know, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases, are pending that were decided before the legislature amended the instruction?              But I take it your answer was that all these were tried before Texas amended the statute.    Was it 1991 when it amended the statute?              And all the cases you mentioned were tried before 1991.
05-11304 +++$+++                 No.    But in this case the counsel for the defendant did one other thing, and it said to the judge, you don't have authority under State law to add to these supplemental instructions.   And I was going to ask you, he was right about that, wasn't he?                  Really?                  Was it the nullification instruction?                But in this case the judge said I'm going to give the nullification instruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite properly, he said that won't work.               Is there no Federal interest in ensuring that there is a full and fair implementation of a Federal right?                And if the State higher standard is erroneously applied, doesn't that prejudice the Federal right?
05-1157 +++$+++  
05-1240 +++$+++               What about the beating of the defendant?              Well then, my question is going to be along the same lines.                 Suppose -- I assume this is a rather frequent case -- the confession is alleged to be the product of a beating.                    The two are merged.    If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment claim anyway, then as a matter of policy, matter of convenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment as well?             Well, we're making up the rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon.              I'm asking, if we have to wait for one, why not wait for the other?             I suppose -- correct me if I'm wrong -- when the district court wants to determine if he should hold something in abeyance, this is not necessarily abstention; this is what courts always do when there are multiple actions.                 Other action pending is a general ground for a court to stay its hand.              I had missed Mr. Flaxman's point that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to say, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this case?     My initial reaction as the defense counsel, I would love that comment.           I would tell the jury:            Of course, it's our duty as counsel to point out that my client was beaten, he was terrified, he was beaten again, he had a false confession, and the damages we're not interested in; we'll get much more damages if you convict and we show this 15 years later because the policemen lied as they always do.                  You know, you hear it.              But he has tried more of these cases than I have and he indicates this is a serious concern.              No, no.         This is the Cook County.    This is the Cook County court.              No, but he says the fact of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim of a beating.              No, but the point is if the complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes that point.              Would it ever be proper for a district court to insist on proceeding to the merits of the claim, to dispose of the merits of the claim, while the prosecution was pending?                       Suppose the district court thought that it was seeing too many of these claims and it wanted to get to the bottom of them?              We haven't written about that other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and in Younger?    That's about it?
05-1256 +++$+++              Do you say this after the fact?   The jury doesn't hear this?             It seems very odd that a major argument for constraint is something that the jury can't hear.    It just goes to show, really, the irrational nature of the exercise.
05-1272 +++$+++ 
05-128 +++$+++              What -- what about the -- the example we discussed, payment of a bond premium if you're self-insured?             But I was -- can -- can I -- I still don't quite understand the answer to the bond premium question.             No.    No, it wouldn't be subrogated.              The bond premium -- the bonding company says we're entitled to priority.             And it files the claim directly with the bankruptcy.
05-1284 +++$+++               I know all that's involved here is the forum and removal; but if we were to rule for you that there' is Federal officer status here, would that effect any of the substantive determinations on the preemption question, etcetera?              It's just a forum question?
05-130 +++$+++          Is there a classic case where the injunction should not be issued?         Business processes?
05-1342 +++$+++                 What's your best case for the proposition that an agency and not the Congress defines the extent of field preemption?
05-1345 +++$+++               Well, it might be a good revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other than ours and we'll charge triple the price.              That's not a burden on interstate commerce?              Suppose the user fee were ten times what it is?              Why is that?              Well, I suppose any private entity can choose its market.              I suppose any private entity can choose its market.               You're a market participant.     You're saying, we're going to serve this class of consumers.       That's your privilege.                But what you do is you have a market participation which is sanctioned by the criminal law.                You've built this trash utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you enforce use of that by the criminal law.                So you're engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to enforce its use.              Well, but it's basic Commerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in what happens to the product out of State.                      Baldwin versus Seelig.              You can't say we want -- we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other States.     That's just contrary to the Commerce Clause.               But I thought that was just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your point two.                 Who mandated this plan? The State of New York?                But the State of New York can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.                If you say the Congress of the United States has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that. That has happened.              But Pike doesn't apply to discrimination.    Pike applies to burdens.              It seems you are conflating the two.              What would you do with Justice Alito's question?          Dean Milk versus Madison: All milk must be processed whether been 20 miles of where it's --              -- produced.              Held discriminatory against interstate commerce.            Could -- under your view, could your city require all milk be pasteurized within your city at a government owned, city owned facility?             No, but Justice Scalia says it always does because it benefits the locality.             You have -- by criminal laws --
05-1429 +++$+++              Well, if you say it doesn't go far enough then I infer from that you say that it's valid as far as it goes?              Justice Ginsburg has a question I'm very interested in.                 Do you defend the Fobian rule?              That doesn't -- and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this context.               Well, Timbers cited, as the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in 506.   That's all it's about.             I don't -- I think Timbers is misleading on this point.              No, attorney for the debtor.                Well, on that point you disagree with the Collier citation at page 9 of the reply brief then?                Well, it says if the creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in connection with protecting a pre-petition claim --                -- the fees will be pre-petition.                So you disagree with that?              I -- I am concerned about your point that there are all kinds of attorneys' fees contracts out there and if everybody can get fees for filing the claim post-petition act, we have a huge amount of claims to pay. Travelers would tell us, though, that a surety is different, that they somehow stand in the shoes of PG&E or something.
05-1448 +++$+++               Well, if you prevail won't plan documents or shouldn't plan documents be amended to say that merger is not an option and any reversion goes to the employer?                Well, how could the administrator, how could the administrator negotiate with the employer to give the $5 million back if it's with a fiduciary?              Well, I suppose if it would have been amended.         But what happens, what happens if the employer wants to continue in business, but simply turn the plan over to a multiemployer plan?               Is that a fiduciary -- and you have an employer that wears two hats.   The employer is also the administrator.              Is that a fiduciary decision?              So then it's the ongoing significance of the decision to the employer that determines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?              I can't see why it's a fiduciary obligation in case A -- a sponsor obligation in case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B.             That just depends on the sequence of timing.              Well -- excuse me.           Excuse me.   I'm just not sure I understand your answer. If the employer finds the rock solid insurance company under -- pardon me, the administrator finds the rock solid insurance company under Justice Scalia's hypothetical under (i) he must consider all other options under (ii)?
05-1508 +++$+++ 
05-1541 +++$+++                 Do you have a citation for that as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?             I don't, I don't see how you can say there's frustration.                Perhaps I'm missing something.    It seems to me that for years the Revenue Code has had two basic schemes.               One is you can contest the liability before you pay the money.                    The other is you pay the money and sue for refund.                    And one requires you go to the Tax Court and the other district court and so forth.    So these are two different schemes and here you have to -- we are advised that even if there was a levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you paid the extra 900.      So those are two very different schemes.    Am I wrong about that?              Of course, because the Government doesn't have the money.                  But in the refund suit the Government has the money.              Often does, but not necessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.
05-1575 +++$+++                 And the district court has substantial discretion in determining whether or not to grant that hearing on that basis.                Part of that discretion is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a likelihood of a different result?                So it seems to me that that is the difficult part of your case based on this evidence.              Well, we know what the fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.              And we could make a determination or the court of appeals could make a determination or the district court could make a determination how likely that would to be affect the result.              I have just one other question on a different matter.              In Judge Bias's dissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from the Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled.                    Can you comment on that?
05-1589 +++$+++                Are the First Amendment rights of the union members, of the workers who are non-union members relevant?               I mean, you -- you begin by talking about the First Amendment but you, you proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of workers involved at all.              Well, I take it States have considerable discretion in determining how to protect Federal constitutional rights.              And absent some direction that we have to consider this as only being for a, for purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First Amendment constitutional rights.             You want us to consider this case as if the First Amendment rights of non-union members were not involved?             But that's been your whole argument so far.              Could the State have a restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all union expenditures that fall within the Abood-Machinist line of cases?              If this were across the board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting member has, then the statute would be void -- would be valid, rather?             No, it's done in this statute.               Well, my hypothetical is that there's a Washington statute or a Washington constitutional referendum provision, initiative provision, which says that as to all protected speech for non- union members who have moneys taken out, there must be affirmative authorization.

05-1631 +++$+++                 He used the turning signal.   That's like the strangler who observes the no smoking sign. (Laughter.)              Well, as the Chief Justice indicated through a question earlier, isn't it reasonable for an officer to assume that it is -- he is trying to escape because there is something more serious than speeding at stake?          I mean, that's the assumption I would draw.              You mean just as many people take off in high speed chases for speeding as for serious crimes?                Can you tell me as of the time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he committed any felonies?                90 miles an hour would not be a felony, not a reckless driving?                Yes.                At no point did he commit a felony?              If he had intended to hit the police officer, was it --              Under, under -- under your rule, what you're concerned with is the bumping, the use of the force.     Under your rule, if the police continue the chase without using the, without trying to ram him, and then there is an accident and innocent people are killed, or injured, I assume that under the tort laws of most states, the police could be liable.             Well, aren't they the proximate cause if they continue the chase without trying to terminate it?             No.      No.    Well, I meant terminate the chase by -- by -- by forcing him off the road.             But isn't there -- but isn't that one way to assure that the police are not liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?              Well, you mean it's irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might injure other people?              But your, your answer to Justice Stevens as I understand it was the police not have the duty to discontinue the chase?                   The obverse of that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e., prolong the injury to the public.                 I'm surprised at your answer.
05-18 +++$+++         Casey -- Casey is very clear in saying the judicial background against which Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the statutory background, and it says the judicial background was that expert fees were quite different than attorneys' fees.           They were not a subset of attorneys' fees.        But -- but the word consultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute.        And that specifically refers to the State educational agency and local educational agency.        And it uses personnel, which sounds to me a very odd way to talk about private experts hired by an attorney.              You don't talk about them as personnel.             Well, that's before the Magna Carta you're asking for in this case which would establish a whole -- a whole --             -- new profession of experts.         Did the -- did the final bill say we adopt the findings of the conference report?         And other bills have said that.         Like in -- as in Nofstiker.
05-184 +++$+++            But I have --           -- I have -- I have trouble with the argument that -- insofar as he says there is a structural invalidity to the military commission, that he brings that before the commission.                     The historic office of habeas is to test whether or not you are being tried by a lawful tribunal.          And he says, under the Geneva Convention, as you know, that it isn't.          Well, it's not some --          -- procedural -- it's the structural requirement of the composition and the -- and the appointing origins of the court.       Well, is --       -- is that -- is that true? If a group of people decides they're going to try somebody, we wait until that group of people finishes the trial before the Court -- before habeas intervenes to determine the authority of the tribunal to hold and to try?             I had thought that the historic function of habeas is to -- one of its functions -- is to test the jurisdiction and the legitimacy of a court.          Mr. --        Mr. Clement, I, for one, have lost track of your time.           I'm interested in your arguments on the -- on the legitimacy and the regularity of these commissions.        And, in particular, why isn't he part of the Common Article 3 under the Geneva Convention, as Judge Williams found?                 That's part of the same question.        Your time is -- why isn't Hamdam a uniquely vulnerable individual that -- you used the phrase "uniquely vulnerable individuals" were involved in another case, but not here.              Why not here?
05-200 +++$+++          But -- but there's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases.         There's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases. (Laughter.)         I mean, that's the kind of uniformity the Government loves.        But I take it you're not foreclosed from making your defense or your claim in the Federal court.
05-204 +++$+++           And -- and in your view, that justification allows the creation of district 25, which has, as far as Latino population, people of quite different economic backgrounds and so forth, you know, the -- the two-ended -- the district on the two ends.          That -- that to me was -- was not discussed much in your brief, but it's a serious Shaw violation.              And -- and the two are really linked, 23 and 25, in this respect because it was by virtue of what it did in 23, that the State claims a right to do what it did in 25.        And as to 23, do you want this Court to say that it's constitutionally permissible to take away a number of minority voters from the district, but leave just enough so that it looks like a minority?           Is that a permissible use of race?       It -- it seems to me that's an affront and an insult.        Well, but -- but the additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make it -- to make it look good.        Well, of course, the reason the lines are straight is nobody is there. (Laughter.)           Well, Justice Stevens --           The compactness standard.         Let -- let me ask you this. Suppose you have a court that's required to redistrict, and the court has two experts.                Expert number one says, here is a plan.                 It's totally partisan in its orientation, but it balances the Democratic and the Republican registration.               It gives them exactly proportional representation.               Plan number two gives minimal consideration to this, but it's compact.                   It takes into account geography, communities of interest, and so forth.          Would the district court be in error if it adopted the first plan?         Well, but my hypothetical is designed to suggest that partisanship, political lines should be certainly a secondary consideration to a valid principled scheme and that perhaps in the hypothetical case, you could reverse a district court for abuse of discretion in -- in overemphasizing political considerations.             And then if that's true, it means that there is some standard lurking out there indicating that political considerations should be of at least secondary importance.        You mean 25 -- the -- the Latino makeup of 25 is accidental?        It's accidental.        Are there cases that -- that we've issued from this Court that address what happens in a case like this where the economic circumstances and many other circumstances of the two Latino populations are very different?                    The border Hispanics and the Hispanics in Austin have very -- very little in common other than -- than the Latino background.             Are there -- are there cases that address whether or not these populations can be combined in -- in order to satisfy the -- the Voting Rights Act requirements?            Have we talked about that?
05-259 +++$+++ 
05-260 +++$+++         Can you cite us to something for the -- can you cite something to that effect?        For your answer.            Would California allow you to intervene when it has a no-subrogation rule?            Well, then how are you going to prevent the funds from being commingled or being assigned immediately to a trust?            I'm not sure how you can avoid also the trustee being one of the named plaintiffs.        Well, what would happen if this case were a weak case on -- on liability and it was settled for $60,000?            What would happen to your tracing theory then?
05-352 +++$+++              Well, it's not just disqualify.              Suppose he denies a motion for continuance.             The counsel is in another trial and he said, I can't be here for another 10 days.              And the court says, I -- I deny that.               I -- I assume if it's an abuse of discretion, the result would be the same under your view.         Well, you may leave the jurisprudence where you found it, but other attorneys might not.          And I'm -- I'm concerned with the consequences of your rule.              There are many reasons, it seems to me, why a counsel may not be able to represent the -- the client that has chosen him as -- as the first choice.         And if -- if you prevail here, it seems to me that counsel can come in and say, now, Judge, I've looked at your calendar, and you can certainly wait for another 2 weeks, and the judge has to do it.         And I don't know why he wouldn't.        But it seems to me that would happen if there's an autonomous, structural right of the kind you -- you urge.         So I want to control the case by having a different appointed counsel.         Well, but -- but this is all subject challenge as an abuse of discretion.             Are there cases in the records where it shows government overreaching or bad faith and so forth in trying to get rid of the counsel? That just doesn't happen?          What are the -- what are the practicalities or impracticalities, as the case may be, of seeking immediate review from the court of appeals by writ of mandate?             I think it would be easy for us to make a distinction between the right and the remedy.        Well, but in all events, we could structure the decision to make -- to make sense, and if these instances happen, as you indicate in your brief, very early, it seems to me that the answer is mandate in a court of appeals.
05-380 +++$+++               Can you tell me -- I didn't find it in the materials.            Maybe the statistics aren't available.   In the cases where intact D&E or D&X are performed in the period I guess, what, 16 through 20, 21st, 22nd weeks, in how many of those instances, do you have any idea, in how many of those instances is there serious health risk to the mother that requires the procedure as opposed to simply being an elective procedure?   Are there any statistics on that?              I have just one other question that, it's generally related to the first. If there is substantial evidence that other procedures or alternate procedures are available, alternate to D&X, alternate to intact D&E, is your response that, although they're available as a matter of science, as a matter of, of medical expertise, they are not available because hospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted?              I was going to ask that same question to the Government, because there is some indication in the record that certain hospitals just don't admit patients for this purpose, which is -- goes back to my earlier question. I was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.              Because it's purely elective and not medically necessary.             Well, it might be related in the sense that the Government's argument that there are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative. I was going to ask the Government about that.                On the other hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't allow the procedure is also indicated, indication that there is a medical opinion against it.             That's what I was wondering, because --             Suppose, this might help, suppose the physician testifies that I wanted to do a non-intact, an in utero D&E, that that's, that was my intent, that's what I wanted to do, that's what I always want to do.    In this case I had an intact delivery and had no other choice.       Are you saying that we could interpret the statute to say that that is not the prohibited criminal intent, he is immune from prosecution in that case?             Well, give me one instance in which your proposed interpretation would work in the real world.             Well, just on that last point, I mean, we are interested of course in different interpretations, but it just seems to me that your interpretation would have very little practical effect.              It seems to me that your argument is that there is always a constitutional right to use what the physician thinks is the safest procedure.              I inferred that from your comments.              So then, you think there are instances in which the State can require that a procedure be used, even if it's not the safest procedure?              So then, the --              The obverse of the proposition I put at first, it must be true that there are some instances in which the State can prohibit a procedure even if it is the safest procedure.
05-381 +++$+++ 
05-409 +++$+++         And your best case on that is Munsingwear?        Oh, the Missouri Pacific case.        On -- on the merits of the issue as opposed to diversity?        Is part of the dynamic here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation because you now have a class action that has to proceed, and that a large part of the litigation strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and in the Federal courts?
05-416 +++$+++            Well, I'm not sure.      It seems to me, as Justice Scalia's question indicates -- I was surprised that we're talking about procedural default.                      I, too, thought this was an administrative law case.                    And it's an administrative law case, because we want the input of the administrative -- of the administrative body.                       In the habeas cases, we're simply giving deference as a matter of comity and courtesy to the State Courts.                    Is it --           Well, not so much maybe input, but so that they can -- they can resolve the program -- the problem within the institution, and not have to come to the courts.          Well, but --          -- but as I interpret your argument, you're saying that there is some merit, some benefit, to avoiding the State administrative procedures. What you're saying is that, "You know, these" --          -- "administrative procedures aren't all that -- they're cracked up to be.                 There's a good reason to avoid them."               I --          That's a --          -- that's a -- that's a difficult argument for us --          -- to accept.           And I suppose you could add to that, that Mr. Himmelfarb wouldn't even accept "reasonable."            He said it has to be "impossible" to comply with.         And is that true even if the State does not have a procedure for reopening for late claims?         Well, suppose --         -- the State says, "We don't consider late claims."          As they do here.         Suppose the State says, "We don't consider late claims."
05-465 +++$+++             Still, it -- it -- you know, we usually talk about person can mean a corporation.             This says individual.             A person is defined in -- in sub (3) just above it.                        A person includes any individual or entity.                     Then the next thing says individual.             So it's not a -- it doesn't sound like a corporation.        Well, what we're reviewing is a ruling, not a question.               You certify a ruling. Now, it's usually set out for the court of appeals so they know what the question is.         What you're reviewing here is a ruling.
05-493 +++$+++              And that page --             -- where he says that is where?             But in --           -- but, in a sense, that's right, just like remorse.           Remorse doesn't excuse the crime.   It's a consideration that you take into account in assessing the gravity of the crime for purposes of punishment.              Well, of course you --              -- don't you -- excuse me. Excuse me.             But we have said that remorse extenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment purposes, under factor (k).             And that --             And that -- and that -- that's post -- that's post-crime.             Oh, you think pre- and crime -- pre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case? I thought that was really the linchpin of your argument?
05-502 +++$+++         No.    It involved -- it involved a homicide, but there, the search in question took place after the premises -- after the entry, after the premises were secured.             The entry was never in question in Mincey.        What was in question was the search after the premises had been secured.        And I don't see how that helps you because here, in the course of securing the -- the premises, they had all -- all the evidence they needed.        So Mincey doesn't help.
05-5224 +++$+++         Did -- did she wait until after the 4 minutes to call the police, or did she -- she have the police on the way after the first minute?        She -- she's just typed that out on the computer or something like that?        And then what -- what's your position if she says he beat me 2 minutes ago, he's left, and he's running down the block?             Well, suppose -- suppose it's a thief, and she said he's taken the diamond necklace and he's running -- and he's running away.                     We know he's not going to come back.             So the -- the jewelry store owner who reports to the -- the police is fleeing on a 911, that -- that's not -- that's not admissible under your view?             Well, what -- what about the -- my hypothetical?        But I'm concerned about the rule you're arguing today because it -- it seems to me there's a good case for allowing the -- the statement by the jewelry store operator.        And -- and I want to know what your position is so that you don't come back next week and say, well, now we want the jewelry store --        We'd rather you analyze the case now and then we'll analyze it later. (Laughter.)
05-547 +++$+++            Why don't you say "it just happens"?     I mean --           -- it's there in the statute.           That's why you're here.
05-593 +++$+++               What happens if the Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State court?   I take it one of the concerns we have here is that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court. Suppose that there is a denial of certification.              Then under (d)(3) --              -- the employee can ask for a certification decision.            I take it that's a Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law point, that the State court must hear and so now we're back in State court?              And we still don't have a jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps you or helps the Petitioner.              But in my case I guess I don't think it ever gets to district court because there's no certification, but then the employee can ask the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of employment.     Am I right about that?             But my point is I suppose the Government can just say, we're not going to make the certification and we're not going to remove.             So then the State court still has to have the bench trial on the scope of employment.             I'm not sure if that helps. It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench trials in almost every case.
05-595 +++$+++                  Well I guess you're asking us to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not that important.    If that's so, I suppose we shouldn't have overruled Roberts.              But that's not this case.              I'm talking about the daughter's testimony.             That's in an instruction, like Toomey versus Ohio.          The judge is corrupt.       It is just structural.    You can't say that about Crawford, or can you?             The problem with your case -- maybe it's our problem because it was our rule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board calculus as to the rule.          In some cases, as I think you will have to concede, under the Roberts jurisprudence, the fact finding was more accurate. In your case, what you are telling us is that the fact finding is far less accurate.              But I think you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we depart with it.     With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not just your case.     It seems to me that was the problem you had in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest some way out.     I don't see it.             Adequate indicia of reliability.
05-5966 +++$+++            Well, to prevail, do you think you have to show that, under prong two of M'Naghten, the right-and-wrong prong, that the defendant can prove really everything, and, in fact, did have the opportunity to prove everything, that he seeks to prove under prong one?                  If it's -- do you have to convince us of that in order to win?           But I am correct in assuming that it is -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- that it is your position, the State's position, that, under the right/wrong prong-two part of M'Naghten, and under the evidence in this case, the court was able to consider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary in order to meet this defendant's defense as to -- as to intent.            I agree with you.          I'm trying to think of some theoretical case where it would make a difference.           I can't quite come up with a hypothetical.            Does that mean that it could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or the friends who talked about this person's illness?            Or are we just talking about the expert testimony?           Is this an alternative argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two, or is this complementary to the argument that the evidence comes in under prong two?         Could the State say that it's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a police officer?         Yes.         Because the next question is, Why didn't they -- isn't that what happened here?          It seems to me that you introduced the -- my concern by saying that they -- the State can put the burden of proof on the defendant, which we know is generally true in many States with reference to the insanity defense.                   But when you link it with mens rea, then it seems to me you have a problem.           It does seem as if the argument, that, "Oh, this all comes in under second -- under the second prong," means that if there's a -- there's another inference.                It's a -- it's a secondhand argument about lack of mens rea.           Kind of, the second-class --           -- sort of evidence.
05-5992 +++$+++         But -- but as we've indicated, the -- the judge was the one that opted out of the act by this regular practice of requiring the perpetual waiver, or whatever we call it.         Did the Government at any point tell the -- tell the court, Your Honor, we think the act requires you to make a specific finding and we request you do that?         Because, I mean, you're -- you're coming in and saying, oh, well, he waived, but certainly the Government could -- could have asked the -- asked the district court to make the necessary findings.        Well, it seems to me the Government is equally remiss for not pointing out the obligations of the court under the act. But let me ask you this.              Probably you can respond to that as well if you like.                    What are the problems with reindicting -- I mean, how -- how is the Government hurt if it can reindict?                    I recognize that it's costly to the system, et cetera.                   But is there any real prejudice there?        Well, of course, I'm -- I'm supposing that after this rule, there would be no trial because there would be -- if -- if you don't prevail, there wouldn't be a trial.        And I'm asking are there -- are there severe costs with that when there's been no trial?        There's -- there's no trial.        The -- the action is dismissed for a Speedy Trial Act violation because the position of the Petitioner here is accepted by this Court and the Government just reindicts.        I'm hypothesizing that there hasn't been.        The case is dismissed.        And there is a reindictment.        How costly is that to the system other than getting the grand jury together?        It's harmless error because he -- the evidence of guilt was substantial?                   What -- how does the harmless error work?
05-608 +++$+++             Suppose they didn't have all the information.   Suppose you enter into a license agreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to pay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the agreement's signed, the technological advances, other disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient.          Could you sue then?            Well, but then -- so then, the argument that you've made is just not --           -- relevant for us, the fact that they knew everything --           And it also means that this isn't really a settlement, in any respect.           Well, Poe versus Ullman was a case in which, even if there was a violation of the law, there was going to be no prosecution.            He -- but, in this -- in this case, if there's a failure to -- of -- conform to the terms of the license agreement, there's going to be a lawsuit.     So, I think Poe versus Ullman is just not relevant.            No, but --            -- but, in Poe versus Ullman, the ultimate action was basically like violating the contract here, and that's why it's not an applicable precedent.               Well, if that's so, and it's a super-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you could get damages.             But I think that your theory is that it's a super-violation of an implied covenant.             "Not only did we agree to it, but we you can't even do it if you agree to it."
05-6551 +++$+++           I'm not sure that that's the way the Black court interpreted it.                The Black court talked about a requirement that the upper-term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists.          That's the whole problem with your case.          That there's -- and incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are general objectives of sentencing.          And that is a term of art that's different from circumstances.          So it's only the circumstances that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence. The general objectives can still be considered.          But what we are involved with in this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that aggravate, and these do require findings.          If those findings aren't there, it's not reasonable.           Well, it is the same old record we've been playing.     But the reasonableness requirement has to be explained further.           And when you explain it further, you find that there must be findings by a preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are set out.                 That's different from the objectives of sentencing.           But the objectives of sentencing are not what's involved in this case.           May I ask you this question? Excluding capital cases, in your view -- anecdotally, if it has to be that -- what percentage of cases that go to juries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated proceedings for sentencing purposes?                    10 percent?         Yes.       You had 200,000 incarcerated when I last looked.
05-669 +++$+++           Well, there's a case involving the Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways --          -- 200 years --          Yes.
05-705 +++$+++ 
05-7053 +++$+++           You could almost argue that the other way.           I mean, it -- it seems to me on predisposition that the defendant knows more about it than the Government does.           I'm not sure what the criteria are that I have to follow -- that we have to follow in deciding the case.                  Just count up all the cases and --           Let me ask -- let me ask you this.         Is -- is there any evidence that -- that we can take account of, commentary, law reviews, to show that the Government has difficulties in -- in meeting a duress defense?        Is -- is --        Is the test proposed by the Petitioner that -- that you have to prove non-duress by beyond a reasonable doubt?        And your test is that the defendant would have to prove it only by clear and convincing evidence?        More likely.    More likely.        Do you think a State could put a burden on the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt for entrapment, duress, insanity?
05-7058 +++$+++                Well, no, it's standard law of agency.     It doesn't make any difference.                     The prisoner is denied his rights.                As Justice Stevens said, there may be three or four different people who concurred.     Do your rules say that if he can't find out with reasonable efforts that he doesn't need to, or does the Sixth Circuit rules say that the delegation of the names is not required?
05-746 +++$+++            Well, two things you might comment on.     First, the in whole or in part, you might take account of the fact that there are other negligent actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury to the employee. Secondly, Section 53 does not contain the language in whole or in part.        I suppose employee associations, workman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied on it.
05-785 +++$+++           That was quoting Holbrook and Flynn.            Yes.       And you're having the judge say that you can't wear certain signs, you can't make certain demonstrations.            If the family were there and they -- and one of the members of the family was sobbing, with tears coming out of her eyes, I -- that --          -- much, it has much more impact than a button.             The record is confusing, at least as I read it -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn. A, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons were worn?             So it may have been for just one day of the trial?           Where does it say that?           These were declarations filed with the United States district court in habeas?
05-83 +++$+++            But the statute does say deadly weapon other than a firearm.           But the enhancement section does.           Well, do you think in this case you'd be entitled to a lesser included offense instruction as a matter of law?           Well, was there any evidence that it didn't have the capacity to fire?           You're not entitled to -- you're not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction for which there's no evidence.           Do you think it would have been error in this case based on the evidence presented and the way the -- the case was argued -- would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury that if they found that there was a firearm involved, they should make a -- they could make a -- a finding on that?           But as a constitutional matter, would it have been error for the judge to instruct the jury in this case, based on this evidence, that they could return a verdict that a firearm was used as part of the assault?           You say regardless of the strength of the evidence.               How about no evidence at all?           Well, the question is whether or not it requires it.            In the charging document, where it says that he was armed with a deadly weapon, to wit, a handgun, and then it cites the Washington statutes, those citations include the 3-year enhancement provision?           It cites RCW 9.994A.125 and 9.94A.310.          Is one of -- is one of those the 3-year enhancement?           9.94A.125.           So it includes the 3 years.           But it does include it.           Well, I -- I take it Washington wouldn't have the option -- suppose that you prevail.         Washington doesn't have the option to give him a whole new trial, do they, because there's been double jeopardy, I take it.           What I'm saying, you don't concede, do you, that Washington would have the option to retry him to try to obtain the 3-year enhancement.           I wouldn't think so.
05-848 +++$+++              Well, is what the government is saying here is that suppose the regulation can be interpreted to say X or Y.       X would hurt the company; Y would not.   Is the government saying, if it is foreseeable that the agency might take the unfavorable position, you then must challenge it in the D.C. Circuit?                 Well, could they have said that construction means both modification and then come up with a new word, alteration?              Because the statute says the term construction includes modification, so I -- construction can be broader.              Could it be an alteration, they would come up with a new term of art, and add that --
05-85 +++$+++               If we think that Powerex, that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain in Federal court if it's entitled To that under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that would be suffer to get around 1447(d)?             But I'm having, I'm having the same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer. Can you say in just a few sentences the difference between the case where there is sovereign immunity, China, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's organ immunity?             You're telling us that one is more important than the other, but there's no textual basis in the statute for us to make that distinction.              I'm asking why is denial of immunity for sovereign status different from denial of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial, etcetera?
05-8794 +++$+++          No.    Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg can protect their own questions. Part of that allegation in here is that the State wasn't forthcoming with the -- with -- with the information requested, and you're not very forthcoming with the answers.         What is the source, what is the legal source, what is the precedent for the proposition that the -- that the condemned man has to come up with an alternative?          What case do you cite?         What principle do you cite?         That's what we're asking.        This -- this is a death case.       It was not that amusing. Let me ask you this.        Doesn't the State have some minimal obligation under the Eighth Amendment to do the necessary research to assure that this is the most humane method possible?               Doesn't the State have a minimal obligation on its own to do that?        Well, I can define gratuitous -- I don't have the dictionary here.               But gratuitous means essentially unnecessary.               If there were other -- other means, other alternatives, that might be used, it seems to me that the State might have some minimal obligation to investigate those.
05-8820 +++$+++               Provided equitable --              But you're asking us to say that the Congress has written a statute which doesn't take account that the state might sometimes file a petition for certiorari that would be granted.                   And you say oh, that's so rare, that's so extraordinary.                     It happens.     It's part of the system.             Well, I'll accept your view as being the personal experience.                      I'm rather surprised that district courts would go through all of these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and they may not have to.             I'm not sure if I would tell the district courts that's what they ought to do, is a wise expenditure of resources.                      I'll think about that.
05-908 +++$+++               Well then, let me change Justice --              Well, my slight modification of Justice Scalia's hypothetical -- and it proceeds on the same theory -- is suppose there's a huge demand for housing.     A developer has a plan to build 500 units.   Can the city say, we'll grant you the permit on the ground, on the condition that 30 percent of all the houses go to minorities?         That means people will live together.     Then we can have a school, a school that can be diverse.              Well, your system is the one that gives a choice to the individuals.              But in Grutter we said, to shorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the U.S. Reports, 539, "the law school's interest is not simply to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group because of race ... that would amount to outright racial balancing which is patently unconstitutional."           And that seems to be what you have here.              The problem is that unlike strategic siting, magnet schools, special resources, special programs in some schools, you're characterizing each student by reason of the color of his or her skin. That is quite a different means.                     And it seems to me that that should only be, if ever allowed, allowed as a last resort.             Justice Alito and Justice Breyer and I myself am interested:                  Can you tell us what has happened since the plan's been enjoined?             I mean, have you gone back to square one?    And it's just, there's no diversity at all?    Or is there substantially more diversity?                Can you tell us about that?      Because it's important.             It may mean that you don't need to identify students by the color of their skin in assignment.              But the emphasis on the fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can get into the school that you really prefer.                  And that in some cases depends solely on skin color.                  You know, it's like saying everybody can have a meal but only people with separate skin can get the dessert.
05-9222 +++$+++ 
05-9264 +++$+++                Well, could you tell us what your position is if we choose to use the noncategorical or the modified categorical approach? Is there a nexus between what's in the presentence report and some other charging documents, or is it just in the presentencing report?               Do you agree that this presentence report cannot be consulted under the reasoning of Shepard, we need more?              You don't think the PSR has some kind of significance that the police report did not?
05-983 +++$+++                 Could the court appoint the parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed as guardian ad litem?              The guardian ad litem cannot proceed pro se?
05-996 +++$+++              Why can't they just have an order to the bankrupt -- to disclose the asset in the Chapter 13 proceeding?             In the Chapter 13 proceeding.             Well, in this case they knew about it, didn't they?
05-998 +++$+++              You could say the same thing about a petit jury.        And in Neder we use the harmless error standard.              Well, can't you allege that the means by which it was done are unknown, but that it was by one or more of the following?               But you come back and you tell Justice Breyer, well, that's because we had no notice.   But that's a different argument than the fact that there was no indictment.              Notice can be cured by a bill of particulars, by the fact that you've had a chance to contest the evidence at trial, that there was no error.   That's a quite different rationale than saying that this is not an indictment.              But that, it seems to me, is your argument, not lack of notice.
06-1005 +++$+++              Did you argue at any point that these were not proceeds?                 Did you argue that in the court of appeals?                Well, I think it is a stretch so far as the question presented.                The question presented is very clear whether or not it is gross receipts or net profits.          That's what we're asked to resolve.              Brief in opposition --               What about the bank robber -- there's just one bank robbery.                They spend $500 to each, to people for their airfare and car rental.                    They rob the bank.   They only get $800.                They lost $200. They then give the $800 to the attorney to please -- or to somebody to please launder the money.                 No profits?               That would be a very silly result.              No.      They gave it to a third person to conceal it, $800.              8,000, 8 million.              Assume that it's proceeds. Assume that they have a money launderer.                 Under your definition there's still no violation?
06-10119 +++$+++                Do you think the deference in Uttecht, which was the death qualified juror --                 -- should be any greater than in a Batson case where we have the sensitive issue of racial discrimination?                 Well, Uttecht --                 Uttecht was a death qualified juror --                 -- and this is a Batson case.                 Because of our concerns in the Batson area, do you think we're entitled to have a different standard of deference for the trial court?                I think your --                 We haven't discussed this --
06-102 +++$+++ 
06-1037 +++$+++ 
06-1082 +++$+++               Don't you think we have to, if not overrule, at least back away from the holding in California versus Greenwood?              I think it is much easier to administer, to have a uniform Federal standard, rather than whether or not an officer can arrest in one county for something and not in another county whether he has to have a badge or not.              Those are the kind of trivialities we talked about in Whren.              And both arrests are illegal, but you're saying that there's a difference. So your bright-line rule now seems to evaporate.              I mean I'm assuming that your answer to my question about the badge or the wrong county and so forth would not result in suppression. Correct me if I have misinterpreted your argument.              What's right?               But then if you -- do you accept the proposition then, in some of these minor cases, the arrest might be valid, then you're whole argument about the Framers and the trespass and so forth is wrong.             The Court simply said we're going to use our Federal supervisory power and incorporate the State law of arrest.                     If we don't have another body of law, we're going to do it.                     It didn't say it was required to by the Constitution.                     That's not the way I read Di Re.             Then you have three cases, not five.
06-11206 +++$+++               You can say the same thing about failure to respond to a traffic ticket.              Can you -- can you tell me:   The U.S. attorney has this case.                    The man failed to report for custody some -- a few years earlier, and you have this offense.      Does the district attorney or -- pardon me -- the United States attorney have some discretion here that he may not prosecute at all?                     What -- what goes into the --                What goes through the mind of -- of a prosecutor?         He says, because this fellow failed to report earlier for this offense, I'm going to give him 15 extra years in jail.                What -- what does a -- are there many instances where you think in a case like this a U.S. attorney would just elect not to file that charge?                Or do you think they automatically file it every time; and if not, how do they define it?             Do they ever look at the -- do they ever look at the attorney?                   This attorney has been giving us a hard time, and we ought to show him that we really mean business?             Do they look at the nature of the -- the identity of the counsel of the defendant?   Do they ever look at that?               But the potential risk is based on an empirical assessment.                 What's -- how can we make an empirical assessment without statistics?               But isn't that's based on our experience because we have these cases; we've been lawyers; we know what they usually involve.              We have some sort of a --                -- an instinct or a basis for making a judgment.                If statistics can inform that, why ignore the statistics?              Well, of course, that's the point.     Begay talked about purposeful violent conduct, not just purposeful conduct.
06-11429 +++$+++                 Could you tell us just a little bit about the rule of lenity?                     You want us to apply sort of a watered down discount rule of lenity in sentencing cases?    And do you have authority for that?                After we said in Granderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying or modifying it at all.
06-11543 +++$+++                Can you tell me what test, what conclusion, you want me to come to in your argument?    Drunk driving is within the last clause because --              Well, I suppose you say most legislatures think this is dangerous.                 That's enough?              I'm not trying to be captious, but I -- it's difficult to find out what the standard is.             Well, I'm not so sure.           It seems to me that the burglary, arson, extortion, explosives involves at least the stereotype of the armed career criminal that you see in movies and hear about in organized crimes testimony and so forth.                   I don't -- I don't think it's completely far of the mark.             Obviously -- obviously incomplete.              It would, in the case of drunk driving - though, it seems this would be a better case for the Petitioner if we were operating under this statute.              It's narrower in that sense as applied to this case.              May I ask you this question?   If the government were not to prevail in the first case, Rodriguez, should we remand in this case, because -- because then he -- the fourth felony would have been improperly found if we rule against the government in Rodriguez?
06-116 +++$+++                  No, just before you go there, if I were a bond investor, I would much prefer issuing bonds if it's the lower value, if it's the assessed value.   I'm just more secure.               Well, you do have a concrete appraisal, but it's just reduced to 35 percent.             In that case, you should want us to exercise jurisdiction, decide it one way or the other.             But you still have the option, and I'm just dying to ask the question not having anything to do with the case.                     Why did they do this?   Why did they have -- was it just to make everybody feel good and they think they're ripping off the government because they're getting only a 35 percent value, even though everybody knows they'll just raise the rate if it changes?
06-11612 +++$+++              Suppose -- I know you don't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the Petitioner's position that there has to be, that the client has to waive.     Would we be better off just adopting the rule that there has to be express waiver, or would you then recommend that we ask the further question whether or not there was an implied consent?             Well, he was there, he probably knew and the record shows that he knew what was going on.             I, frankly, don't think we should go down that route.                How does that work?   You have some jurors, and you have juror's excused for cause, and there is an argument about that, then that juror has to sit down and wait for two days and then they go back and they review that before the district judge.   I just don't know mechanically how that can work.                Excuse me, if the Article III judge says, oh, this should not have been excused for cause, then you go back and bump the juror.              Do you think the magistrate judge would overstep -- assuming you win and that is that rule is that the attorney can make the waiver, would the magistrate judge overstep by saying I know you've consented to this, but I want you to talk to your client about it; I want you to explain what the rules are?    Would that be overstepping?
06-1164 +++$+++                Aren't statutes of limitations generally more equivocal than that?             May I go back to the answer you gave Justice Stevens when he asked you to assume that there was no precedent, we're reading this as an original matter.       I thought your answer to him, correct me if I'm wrong, was that, well, in any event "shall be barred" means that it can't be waived anyway. But statute -- I looked up other statutes of limitations, and other statutes of limitations:             "Shall not be entertained," "may not be commenced," "may not be brought."             My response was all statute of limitations say that and all statute of limitations can be waived.
06-1181 +++$+++                  May I ask one question? And I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer was going to begin.       I take it that the motion to reopen has -- shows new evidence, new factors, new circumstances; and that would be unavailable on the appeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented.                 Or am I wrong about that?                While you have an appeal -- while you have an appeal from what was in the record.                If you don't have the motion to reopen then the -- then the new material is not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?              In one of your -- in one of your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of voluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and so forth.     I assume that voluntary departure is never elected as an option before the Board rules.              In other words, it -- or am I wrong?              Yes, but the removal -- at the outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the outset of the hearing?             No, no, no.           I mean in a contested case.
06-1195 +++$+++               I didn't understand that point when you were having your colloquy with Justice Breyer, either.        I thought you were going to answer to Justice Breyer, that the court of appeals does have the right to determine whether to the extent the Constitution and the laws of the United States are applicable, whether such standards and procedures, such as CSRT, are -- - to make the determination -- are consistent with the Constitution --              -- that's provided in the MCA.               But the statute --               But the statute talks about standards.   Why can't that question that Justice Breyer raised be reached by the Court of Appeals under the CSRT review hearings when it determines the constitutional adequacy of the standards, or am I missing something?              Just one more question on that point:    Would the Court of Appeals in -- under the MCA have the authority to question the constitutionality of the definition of noncombatant -- of unlawful combatant?             How can we fit your position when we have no jurisdiction here?             Our opinion says have a nice day, everybody. (Laughter.)
06-1204 +++$+++                 Well, the difference in the redo is that in the second case that's just been hypothesized, the Philippine government is represented. We are making these assumptions, and the Philippines government says:   You can make these assumptions, but they may very well be wrong; we want to be represented before you make those assumptions.                Any party that's beyond the process of the court has a right to come in.                 The question is what happens if they are not there.             In making that balancing, what weight did they give to the sovereign immunity of the Philippines?
06-1221 +++$+++                You said there was going to be an agreement that this would be a trial or a day, a day and a half.               Was that before or after the premise this testimony would not be admitted.              You told it can be done in a day and a half.     Because these five were excluded.              I don't think that has any bearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's under review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and that we're looking at here.               Has this Court said that 403 determinations must always be made on the record?               Well, I thought that's precisely what you are saying, that that there is no balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.
06-1249 +++$+++                If we conclude that new information is the criterion for deciding this case, if we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if there's new information, then the label has to be changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this verdict be sustained?               And the Vermont court's opinion?              Well, to put the burden on the manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10 States have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption and inconsistent also with the instructions the jury received in this case, that you can consider the FDA label.   So, I think, to me, what you say there is not borne out by what happened in this case or by those other States' --
06-1286 +++$+++                If we can rush to the fallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that says would the expense have been incurred if the nontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that the trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?               And I think the structure of the statute requires us to -- to do that.                 It almost sounds like ordinary and necessary under 162?                 212.       I understand that.
06-1287 +++$+++               Why would your position be any stronger if it used fair market value?              Or any weaker?              What do you mean, we have false "fair market value"?          I never heard of such a thing.
06-1321 +++$+++  
06-1322 +++$+++              But I thought conciliation was an important policy of the EEOC.             But you want us to write an opinion saying, we're not concerned with conciliation?     We just --                 Is that in the record?                 Under the --
06-134 +++$+++               And under New York law does property, do property tax liens have some superior status?     Are they distinct under New York law from other liens?              Without reference to priority.               I -- I had thought they had a greater priority and that they even survived purchase from bona fide sellers.             Is this the Vienna Convention?             European Convention.              Now -- now I take it you under New York law and the law of most jurisdictions, the tax lien becomes a lien against the property before any judicial proceedings.              Just because they are unpaid.    And this is probably a question more for them than for you, but as you understand their position, if you put a lien on the property for unpaid taxes, are they entitled to demand its removal?              You mean of course they can under their view?              No.      No.    No.              Can they demand that that lien be released --              No, no. -- because it violates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act?   Is it their position that you have no right at all even to notice a lien against the property?               It would seem to me to follow from what they're saying.               My hypothetical is can they demand that the lien be removed solely because of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.              With reference to the offset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under the controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do you have to have a judgment first?
06-1413 +++$+++               Well, if you did not proceed on the unitary business there, let's take that off the table.   It seems to me that Lexis's presence in Illinois is quite irrelevant.              It seems to me that, under your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.               And if I can just add on to that same question:        If you're going to have the unitary-tax theory, that's -- that's very helpful.                  But if we take the unitary-tax theory off the table, it seems to me that you are confusing the law by having some midway test.    I don't know what your theory is, that -- in relation to this part of Justice Breyer's question.                 But Mead didn't receive -- pardon me -- Lexis didn't receive the money for the sale, Mead did.                 Unless, again, if Mead's presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what happened here, absent a unitary theory.                 Do you think that if there had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was -- it was sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois then could have had a tax?                 All right.      So, then, the asset stock doesn't make any difference?                 That gets back to Justice Stevens's initial hypothetical.                If you live in New York and you have an investment in a company that does a lot of business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident individual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois could tax it.              But it seems to me that those factors are wholly irrelevant to the fact of sale. It's just whimsical.       It has nothing to do with the sale. The reason we use apportionment in other cases is, just as in Justice Breyer's railroad example, there is no other way to tell, and so forth. But here the presence of Lexis in Illinois is wholly accidental with reference to what went on in the sale.               And that is different --              But the proration, it seems to me -- that should have nothing to do with the extent of Lexis in Illinois --   -- nor does it have to do with the extent of Mead in Illinois.
06-1431 +++$+++              Well, you say it's clear, but neither you or the government seems to tell me any words in this statute.       Your argument is that we should create a cause of action in order to make this effective.   I understand that argument.                I think the Court's cases stand against it, and if you want to -- but it seems to me that you're admitting that nothing in the words of the statute as amended help you.                 And the government -- which as well is an impairment, which I think is quite wrong because that's not what section (c} intended for.   But that's almost an admission on the government's part that it can't find any words in section (b) either.              But that was there before -- but that was there as of the time of Patterson.              So then Congress did nothing by the amendment to help your case.              Patterson was not a retaliation case.              Patterson was a discharge and harassment case.              And the words do seem to cover that.             But nothing that you argued so far shows that the words of the statute as amended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your case.              I do not read subsection (c) as giving substantive rights.                  I mean, you can argue about that.    I think you have to talk about (b), and I think you have a valid point when they say that they're extending the protection for the life of the contract. But I still want to know what particular words in section (b) you rely on?           "Benefit"?             "Privilege"?             Because it's ironic to say all those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with them and disagreed with Patterson.             But that was true in Sullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is in a particularly advantageous position to enforce the rights of the buyer.     It's part of his own contract. And to extend it to the situation we have here is quite an extension of Sullivan in my view.              What I'm -- what I'm taking away from the argument is that if I were to write this opinion in your favor, I would have to say that it's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting retaliation in order to make these other words effective.   And that seems to me a very limited argument and a very difficult argument for you to prevail upon, given the authorities and the approach of the Court that we've discussed.              I understand that, and -- and there certainly is a cause of action as to all the terms in the contract, but you want to add -- for me to add a new term.    You can't use the existing terms to say that there is a cause of action other -- that helps your client, other than that there is a general approach that there is protection post-contract formation.                     I would have to agree with that; and I don't think you can get out of it impairment.                Now you're making enforcement, as with Patterson.                Now you're just talking about make or enforce and that brings us right back to where we started.               Are you asking us to infer, to find implied in the words a cause of action against retaliation?               What words --               What words in the statute? And not "impairment" because I don't agree with the government on that.               A third reason is that the word isn't in the statute.             Well, that's a benefit, privilege, and term of the contract --             -- to me fairly obvious to me to include harassment.          That was the situation in Patterson.   That's what Congress sought to address. Retaliation is something quite different.             Well, then why were you --             -- talking about impairment in your brief?              Well, of course, and you in your brief bracketed that and just made that equivalent to retaliation.           I don't think it is because he was arguing that he didn't -- he was himself injured because he couldn't sell his own property.               He has an interest in his own property.              And that just isn't true in the standard retaliation case of the type we're discussing.             But a seller is -- or a would-be seller is always a built-in advocate for a buyer if some third person interferes with the contract.
06-1456 +++$+++               Then what you're saying, I suppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're illegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se concealment?              Give me an example of when you take money outside of the country that's illegal money --              -- that's not a concealment?              Well then, let me back up. Then let me add this.        It seems to me that you're saying, as you have to say, that any movement of illegal funds outside the country which is concealed is per se concealing a relevant attribute?              But if you do.              I think you have to go that far to make the case you're making.              But you're always concealing the control.          You're always concealing the ownership.     You're always concealing the location if it's in your shoe or in the bottom of the car.              Well, your answer to Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me. It -- it seems to me your answer should be yes, because he's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes across the border, which brings me to my earlier question, if once it's concealed, the statute is always -- is always valid. Then you indicated that oh, well, what happens at the destination is very important.                 Then we had Justice Scalia's hypothetical.                 I'm not sure where you came out on that.                 So Concealment, concealment during the transportation is always a concealment of an attribute under the statute.                That has to be your position.              Other than that?              But you, in response to one of my hypotheticals, said that it would be relevant in some cases to show that it was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.               So you put that back in --              So you put that back into play.
06-1457 +++$+++                  If -- if your theory prevails and you go back to the Commission, does the Morgan Stanley contract, where the lower rate seller was, does that get reevaluated, too?                      You reevaluate all the contracts back down the line?                 Let me say that, consistent with your theory, that everybody -- that this whole unwinding process backs up all the way down to the original seller?              I think you could argue that it should be just the obverse.
06-1463 +++$+++               Did you take that position below, was the question.              The arbitrator already agreed to do that.      You didn't need the injunction for that purpose.              Well -- but if your position is that we have to preserve the integrity of the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the State builds in to that procedure, de novo review Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't make any difference.               I just want to understand your position.   In this case, does the California provision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply to stay the arbitration while that aspect of the proceeding is completed?               My question was to the labor commissioner.          You also have a de novo right to go to the superior court.               Suppose the labor commissioner said something absolutely silly.               Wouldn't you think you would have the right to go to the Superior Court?               And it would make no sense to do that and -- and not to also stay the arbitration.              No.      Now, we have this case.     We have an arbitration clause.              The arbitrator is waiting. You go to the labor commissioner, you go to the superior court to say enjoin the arbitration while I go to the labor commissioner.              The labor commissioner does something silly.        Can you not then go to superior court and get de novo review of that wrong decision of the labor commissioner before the arbitration starts?              Have you taken that position consistently in this litigation?              You have taken no position on it either way?              Are you telling us that under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case, would you go to the superior court for de novo review and -- and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?              All right.           Let's assume the arbitration clause is valid.              Even though in this case you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed for the labor commissioner.            So the case does not have to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed, in the superior court?              In this case, the Court of Appeals, the majority said the fact that the losing party will have a right to de novo hearing, involving additional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant from the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy.                And I think you're preserving the option to go to the Superior Court, at least the contestability of the arbitration clause.                So that, it seems to me, makes incorrect your statement in your brief that, oh, this is just for eight months, so that there's very little additional time involved because of the de novo hearing.                Don't you think that your statement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in that respect?                But you also have the right to challenge what -- the accuracy of the Labor Department's finding.       That's what both -- all the judges on the California court agreed with that.             So I'm asking, doesn't that make -- require qualification of your statement at page 34 that these procedures are expeditious and informal and do not entail additional expense or delay?    All of --              That does require some qualification there.              All right.       Does it also require some qualification in you brief where, at page 12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer in the television industry?    Our rules say that you cannot raise matters for the first time in this Court.                 And you have no evidence on that point.              I know you didn't, and that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief. Doesn't that require some qualification?                Therefore, don't make factual averments here for the first time.                Do you think, in the briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements that are not in the record?                I think they do say that it is disputed.    They do dispute that he clearly and repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer. That's the whole issue in the case.                But they said it is -- they dispute that it is to procure employment.               That seems to me completely inconsistent with your argument that additional time was minimal.            And if you have repeated statements in your brief that require qualifications, if in your former argument in Marshal, the Court is concerned with the accuracy of one of your citations, shouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us?
06-1498 +++$+++                The converse of that is that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome. I mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's thousands of documents here; they won't be submitting anything else.   But, on the other hand, that cuts against you when we're talking about the intrusiveness on the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal regulators go back through all of this stuff again.              Your premise still is, is that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that your premise?              I know your purpose is different, but the premise on which you operate is that the drug should not have been sold.               You can back up as long as you want as long as you come forward and answer. (Laughter.)              Aren't you going to tell this jury that the drug should not have been on the market?             I thought under the Michigan scheme you don't have to show that.            You just show approval, and that's the end of the case in Michigan.             And in your view could a State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant that the drug was approved by the FDA?             And all they say in the statute:   We just think -- they just think this is irrelevant.             But I don't think that's consistent with your position.               There's no doubt about that.
06-1505 +++$+++               But you there agree that there is a distinction between "business necessity" and "business reasonableness"?
06-1509 +++$+++                 Under your response to Justice Stevens, once you show that it was from a likely source of income that he received it, it's unreported, then it's the defendant's burden to go ahead and show this was a 301 distribution, that I had a basis that absorbed it, that there were no earnings and profits. That's all for the defendant.              Let me get something clear.    They wish to introduce evidence.                They wish to introduce evidence.       And you say, oh, well, the proffer is no good because there is no basis, so there was no evidence.    I don't understand that.              Oh, I see.              And you say there was no other evidence in the record that the expert could use for that testimony?
06-157 +++$+++               It seems to me unduly intrusive for the courts to tell the President that it cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have certain talents that the Government may use to make sure that all of their energies are used properly by the Federal Government. It's almost like a speech rationale. And perhaps you would say that's just a judgment on the merits, but it seems to me that there's a standing concern here, too, that we would be supervising the White House and what it can say, what it can -- who it can talk to.               And it seems to me that's quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing purposes. I'm not sure that this makes a standard that distinguishes the case from Flast or brings it within those -- within those cases.
06-1595 +++$+++               You don't have to answer that.    We'll be glad to see you again. (Laughter.)
06-1646 +++$+++               I guess what you're saying is that if it's a victimless crime, that the second offense is no more injurious to the State than the first was.   I'm not sure that's the case.                    The fact that the State sees multiple offenders, repeat offenders, in its community means that they have to spend extra resources to prevent -- to incarcerate them because they have a network of distributors, et cetera.                     They are more experienced, so they are more dangerous to the State.             Well, I'm not sure the offense is the same.       I think the injury to the State is compounded by the repetition.             It affects the tone of the community, the number of law enforcement officers we have to have, the cost of reincarceration, rehabilitation, etcetera.               But that's what I'm addressing.     It could be more serious when it's the second time.              The offense in and of itself.
06-1666 +++$+++              But I really wanted to get your answer to Justice Stevens's first question straight.    You think citizenship is not relevant?             But I thought you were not basing your case on the citizenship?             I might have --              Well, why didn't you answer Justice Breyer -- and we've interrupted you a He's going to be couple of times.    You have the box. I don't see then why you released.   They want him. didn't answer Justice Breyer's question differently. Because what I understood               Well, what we're doing --               What we're doing is we're testing the authority and the propriety of the district judge to proceed.               And that's why we are asking if, at the end of the day, the order is a release, is there a problem?             And I should think you'd yes.              It seems to me that you're begging -- you're begging a question -- you're inserting a premise that we have to decide, whether the release is unlawful.   We're asking, that's part of the equation. I'm the district judge.        Can I say, I've looked at all this, I want this prisoner released tomorrow morning; and if the Iraqis pick him up, fine with me?                Can I say that?             But it seems to me your statement is wildly overbroad:              That there is a due-process restriction on release by the United States Government to another sovereign?             If we have an undercover agent in Japan who finds a drug dealer, he gives him to the Japanese police.             I don't understand that. That's a sweeping statement.            That just can't be right.              But you've just said that it's unlawful.    You said that an American law enforcement officer working in another country who takes custody of a wanted criminal cannot turn him over to the government of that country.               That's just got to be wrong.
06-1717 +++$+++              It seems to me the question is a valid one, that you're running away from the question.             And I'll let you answer. It suggests this further inquiry.                 Suppose that a solo practitioner knows that a paralegal in another firm is very good at this and he asks the other lawyer, may I use your paralegal, and he just sends that lawyer the bill.   What -- how would that be billed under your view?             They both -- they both apply, they both apply to outside experts.               But again, you're not answering the hypothetical.             Let's assume two cases: Case A, you hire an outside paralegal at $85 an hour. He is outside, he is independent.                 He is just like the expert engineer in the Chief Justice question, $85 an hour.   Case two, it's your own paralegal.                The prevailing rate for which you charge general clients is $85 an hour. Why should there be a difference?             But under your -- they can't even charge $85 an hour.
06-179 +++$+++               Is the manufacturer free to continue to sell the device after newly discovered risks --              -- pending the FDA's acting on the same information?              It takes time for the FDA to act.   Let's assume that we know it's going to take six months for the FDA to do this.                 The manufacturer knows that there's a real problem.                 He can continue to sell in the face of the knowledge of the real problem?              I was asking you about the manufacturer's duty pending the FDA's action.                 If the manufacturer finds just from its own laboratory experiments and not because of any data it's received from doctors and patients that there's a better way to do this, does it have the obligation to notify the FDA?              Suppose a label is approved in a very specific form under PMA, and then a year later, it turns out, unforeseen by anyone, that doctors are just -- many good doctors are just reading it the wrong way and it's dangerous. Can the manufacturer continue to sell new devices with the same label pending the annual report?              Just take --              Just take my hypothetical.             And you could -- and the manufacturer continued to sell the device knowing that the label is being misconstrued by very good doctors pending FDA action?             Yes, it's very serious.             Does the failure to give that notice subject the manufacturer to liability if the manufacturer continues to sell the device?
06-219 +++$+++               I'm not sure, Professor Tribe, that the cases you cite at page 22, 23 of your brief really support your position.                     The question is whether there should be a freestanding cause of action for damages.              And in the brief you say that the government says that this is limited First Amendment, and then you say, "These remarkable claims are unsurprisingly false."          I thought that was a rather severe charge against the government, that it's misrepresenting its cases.              Then in page 22 and 23, you go ahead and you talk about Wisconsin versus Yoder, Lefkowitz versus Turley, Bordenkircher, which I think was vindictive prosecution or adding on charges.                    All of those are in the -- every one of these cases are in the context of a criminal proceeding.                Griffin, a murder case.   It's just alleging a constitutional --              -- alleging a constitutional claim.      Well, which one?              Well, no.       That was, there was an existing case or controversy there.                That wasn't a freestanding cause of action.              None of these cases are freestanding.   Davis versus Passman, different.              Well, it seems to me that those cases do not support your position, and I don't think it's correct to say that this is unsurprising, that the government makes a false representation about cases.              I think it was in the context of a freestanding right, but let's leave that aside.              That's right.      It does seem to me that you are asking us to extend Bivens, this is an extension.    Would you accept that?               It's statutory.                 But Professor Tribe, all these cases are cases in which there is -- Nollan, you have a cause of action to challenge the permit and this is just a, this is just a constitutional defense. That's different from a freestanding cause of action. And I share Justice Scalia's concern.                       It seems to me in thinking about this case there is -- there could be something very wrong here, going after a person because of what he's done.      Suppose the Government wants somebody to be a witness in a trial and he won't do it, and they go around hurting his business, they go around invading his property and so forth.                       That to me is outrageous and you might have an argument that there should be a Bivens cause of action for that. And Justice Scalia's question -- I had the same question -- is why do we think it to the property? The essence here, the essence of what's going on, is that they're being vindictive against this person.                        Now again, the cases you're citing, include Hartman, which is a free speech case which is different, really don't support you.   I think this is an extension of Bivens.               Fair enough, but it's an extension of Bivens.
06-278 +++$+++                Well, would you waive damages against this principal who has devoted her life to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for this sophomoric sign that was held up?                Can the student be allowed to wear a button that says "Rape Is Fun"?                Why?                Why?               But do you concede that there was some right of school control for what was going on across the street?               If kids were throwing bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no right or duty to go over there and stop it?               Well, that's because the school has a right of control.              Of course I disagree with the characterization on disruptive.                       It was completely disruptive of the message, of the theme that the school wanted to promote.      Completely disruptive of the reason for letting the students out to begin with.                       Completely disruptive of the school's image that they wanted to portray in sponsoring the Olympics.              Some of the students were carrying the torch and the band was playing in the parade.                So under your view, if the principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the street, had to come up and say now, how many here are truants and how many here are -- I can't discipline you because you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the bottle. (Laughter.)
06-313 +++$+++               Well, could a prosecutor say, one of the factors you must take into account when you begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the death penalty?    Deterrence is one of the reasons we have the death penalty.              To teach us.         Can he say that?              So then now we have the principle that you can talk about deterrence.                     Now it is just the way in which he talked about deterrence?              What do you think, go on and on -- suppose he'd mentioned deterrence six times?              Right.               You have this only in a footnote in your reply brief.                It wasn't raised in the BIO.             So if the prosecution had not opened the door, that would have been improper?                  You overrule -- the judge said counsel, you can't argue about sending a message for life?             You -- you think the trial court could tell the defense counsel that the defense counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen there is nothing more precious than life and that's what we're asking you to decide here and we want you to assert the values of this community that we value life? You can't say that?              Is part of moral culpability that you take moral instruction from thieves murderers on the street, as opposed to those higher standards for which society seeks to aspire?                   Is that moral culpability?              Is it moral culpability for you to take as an example for your behavior the criminal population?             You're talking about moral culpability.    Is it part of your moral culpability that you take your values, your instructions, your behavior from criminals, as opposed to people who uphold the law in society?    Is that part of moral culpability?             Well then, isn't it relevant what's happening on the streets, etcetera?              If the Eighth Circuit had had Lawrence in front it, it would have ruled differently?     Or should it have ruled differently, in respect to Lawrence?             Under Lawrence the Eighth Circuit would have been wrong?
06-340 +++$+++                 Are you -- are you saying that the consultation does beyond the nine factors that are listed in the statute?                But isn't that beyond the nine factors?                I -- I understand that. But when they sit down and they have the consultation, is it proper for the EPA to say now, we're consulting with you, but only with respect to the nine factors, as to permits that are issued by the states afterwards, but then that's something else.              But what is your position as to the propriety of the EPA's saying what I've said in my hypothetical instance?           If they -- they say we're going to consult with you but we want to make it clear we're only talking about the nine factors.              Well, I think you are at issue with the government on that point.             If the EPA can protect the plants when the permit is under its own jurisdiction, why can't it use that same basis for objecting when it's under the State's jurisdiction?
06-376 +++$+++                If, if the history of this issue had been such that before the enactment of this section the courts of appeals were divided or the courts were divided as to whether or not there was jurisdiction in the Court of Claims and in the district court, would your position be different?                So it's, so it's only (h) that gives any court any jurisdiction at all?                Even though in our hypothetical world some courts of general jurisdiction thought that they did have jurisdiction?             Well, isn't it an abuse -- isn't it an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to fail to do what the statute tells him he absolutely must?             The poor do not have the incentive or even the ability to defer paying a tax, where the people that have large bank accounts may, and investments, may well profit by just paying the interest to the Government.              They're exactly alike but for their ability to earn interest in different ways.
06-413 +++$+++                It may well be objected, there were 12 instances --               -- in which the prosecutor wanted to excuse; in seven of those, there was an objection.               So he certainly knew how to object.   And you absolutely trap the trial judge here by not indicating to him that he should make some further finding.     In fact, the -- the -- the lawyer doesn't just remain silent.              He's standing and says I have no objection.              And incidentally the court did not say are there any objections?                   The court did not say that.              Well, but the court didn't say is there an objection?          So you're incorrect.              You think he could have imposed the death penalty in this case?              What's the harm then in replacing him, from your standpoint?              You're complaining about the excusal of a juror who by your own submission would impose the death penalty.         So why am I here?              I would like to hear the answer.              There were actually 12, I think.     Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution? I was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal time of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is a large number of challenges by the prosecutor.                     Can you comment on that?     12?     I mean, the defense objected to seven, and five objections were sustained.              Thank you.                No.      I think the prosecution challenged 12 times.                   There were seven objections.    Five were sustained.              Well, let me put it to you this way:   There's no demeanor finding here.                 Suppose the judge had made a demeanor finding.                  That would be different, the case would be a different case, wouldn't it?              And if the objection is what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should be able to consider the fact there was no objection, even though Washington law doesn't require it before we consider the issue.             Does the fact that this is structural error, that there's no harmless error analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give substance to the rule that there's deference to the trial judge?   And in fact, in the Witt case, we said that the determination to excuse a juror is based on determinations of demeanor and credibility that are within the trial judge's province.                 We said that.               What presumes that there is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or not it's mentioned?     It was not mentioned in Witt.               Should defer to Judge Kozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?
06-427 +++$+++              Did it serve the suspension or has that been stayed?                    Was it suspended from competition for two years?             That was the penalty.             Did it -- did that take effect?             One year --             Weren't all these things that are being discussed before the factfinder, or was there some ex parte contact later which was the only evidence for what we're talking about now?                I'm getting into the due process point.             But I mean, all of these matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to reply to all of these matters that we've just been talking about, correct?                 It doesn't seem to me like there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due process violation.
06-43 +++$+++        Well, I thought -- I agree with Justice Ginsburg.         I thought the "in-connection-with" argument is actually in addition to or separate from an additional argument you made that there was no deceptive statement made here.      I thought that's what you were arguing, and I have problems with that argument because the statute doesn't require a statement.         It requires -- conduct suffice.       Would you say that there was deception, standing alone?     Well, but that's --     -- that's not the allegation of the complaint.      I -- I thought the allegation of the complaint was that they -- they knew that this was a fraud and they participated in the fraud.       But I mean that -- so that your answer doesn't seem to be -- get us very far on a legal point.       If we accept --       If we accept your theory of the case and we then get another case in which an accountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for publication to the investors and then gives it to Charter, and they are before us, could we find liability under 10b-5 as to the accountants and still rule -- and still keep our ruling in favor of your client here?        And if so, what would --        And if so, what would be the rationale?        How about outside accountants and attorneys who deliberately and directly participate in negotiating -- or in drafting the false disclosure statements?        Could they be liable and under your theory of the case, but your client not liable?       Do you know, Mr. Shapiro, if in the law of torts and the restatement of torts or in other areas of the law there is some third classification that's between aider and abettor in principle?     And I take it in your view they cannot establish the "in connection with" argument?     Prior to the statment, there is no reliance, but that there is "in connection with" --
06-457 +++$+++                  Ms. Brinkmann, I'm interested in two things.            Number one, I want to make sure you completed the quantification point that you made, and you pointed us to someplace in the record, because the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a package or something like that. And then the second point, I think probably not related, is the question of knowledge.                  I take it you're not contesting if there's actual knowledge that it's a minor that there can be a prosecution.                  I'm not sure how that works if the company -- because of the imputed knowledge.      Suppose an officer of the company or some shipping clerk knows it.               Wouldn't the company be liable if the company were subject to -- those are two different questions.              Just on the knowledge point, I'm still not sure.            I don't want to ask you if you concede that knowing delivery would make you liable. That's what the First Circuit said.                       I suppose that's not before us, so I have to take that as a premise, as a given.              It's a little bit hard to write the opinion your way with that, with that concession.     That's my problem.             Or with that premise.              Well, but the way -- I'm telling you I assume the way it works is that the UPS truck goes out to the tobacco warehouse and picks up 4,000 boxes, all registered tobacco.                      He certainly knows it's tobacco at that point.               Why is it that knowledge requirements have a different preemption analysis? That's what I'm finding that difficult to understand.               Then that's clear preemption in Justice Breyer's example.                   If California says you must ship certain products in refrigerated containers, that is definitely preempted under your analysis.                It seems to me rather odd that major carriers can determine the scope of pre-emption.    Suppose there are smaller carriers that say we don't want to do this.              Take the New York settlement example.      If the New York settlement example, in effect, opens up a new kind of service, all other carriers have to follow that?            That's a -- there's no authority in our cases for that kind of pre-emption analysis, is there?
06-480 +++$+++               Well, I thought the per se rule was the cookie cutter approach.               Does that presume a contract in which the retailer has a separate charge for the service?               If not, I don't see how that would work under your rule.
06-484 +++$+++                 Do we take judicial notice that a CEO knows these things and that's the strong inference.              But you agree you have to have that?    You have to have some specific allegation to show of his knowledge?        We can't just infer that?                 So you would say that you could have a beyond reasonable doubt standard that must be met at the pleading level, but more likely than not at the jury level?                 We want to know what the rule is.              And I hope we're going to recognize that Congress thought it was doing something. Your argument so far, Professor, doesn't indicate that Congress --                You indicated that the -- you know, the plaintiff had to do all this investigation.   The whole point of this was that the defendants were being disadvantaged.              Well, I think more likely than not, most people think of 49, 50 percent.              Can you tell us whether strong inference is stronger than more likely than not?              It sounds to me like --              I want, I want to be fair. I interpreted your argument -- and please tell me if this is incorrect -- as indicating that if I think strong inference is greater, more onerous than more likely than not, at the pleading stage, I then also have to say this is the instruction that must be given to the jury?   In order to avoid the, the discontinuity between the pleading stage and what --
06-5247 +++$+++               Well, maybe, maybe you'd end up --               The third party perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or Hearst?               And there -- there was a link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship between Hurtz and the victim?              Was that established in other testimony or would that all have come out just only through Maples?              Right.          Okay.                How did Hurtz's name enter into the trial?                Why did anybody mention him?              Did he say he'd killed peoples otherwise, or at other times? (Laughter.)              Well, but then at that point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction -- Maples' testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation, becomes more relevant.
06-5306 +++$+++ 
06-531 +++$+++               In other words, to avoid fees on fees, we do something that's wrong?
06-5618 +++$+++ 
06-562 +++$+++                So that means that in every settlement agreement you'd have to engage in this analysis to see whether or not it was fair.
06-571 +++$+++                 I suppose you could say we used the gun in order to complete the drug transaction.               Are you saying that the parties are viewed collectively so that in Justice Breyer's example the pitcher and the batter used a ball and a bat.   Is that your position?                  And in this case the seller and the buyer used drugs and a gun.               Well, does that fit with the words of the statute, any person who --              Even though it's a collective enterprise, you can still focus on one of the parties and prevail. Is that your position?
06-5754 +++$+++              Well, perhaps I misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this concern, and I thought it was his concern as well.                    At the appellate level, is the presumption something that can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing or is it just an initial benchmark?                    We're playing with standards and words here.             And when we talk about presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a little strange in any event.              You usually talk about presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.                 So we write that this is an additive thing?
06-593 +++$+++ 
06-618 +++$+++              What's the test for intruding?   If it would chill his exercise of the function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk about legislative decisions, or what?             What if it required him to say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50 percent to health care issues?              Would that involve is -- is that a Speech or Debate Clause problem?              I have one question.    The Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court of appeals?     Did they appeal from the district court?              But under 1291, the United States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.              So it seems to me that their position contradicts their own basis for jurisdiction here.           Do you agree with that?              Well, but my point is that the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here.              In Eichman, I was able to get out the district court and the last part of the district court, the last line of the district court, it says the law under which these three -- let me begin again -- the law under which these three defendants have been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about what happened in the district court.
06-6330 +++$+++               Does the Guidelines supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony provision is general and the Guidelines -- the ratio is specific?              Suppose experience shows that the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony provision -- we find that over a course of time?
06-637 +++$+++  
06-6407 +++$+++              You gave him one week and there were no funds for his own psychiatrist.                 You do agree that Ford stands for the proposition that there must be a hearing that meets the essentials of fairness so that the defendant can contradict the hearings that -- the conclusions of the State-appointed psychiatrist?                 But I did understand counsel's argument to say that relief must be given, he cannot be executed, if he lacks the capacity to form a rational understanding of the nature and justification for the punishment.       You, I take it, would agree that if we can just use the lay term, you cannot execute an insane person if he is grossly psychotic, and you can't execute a comatose person?             So we're talking about what insane means, and that's a lay term.                So suppose there's a gross psychosis which is a severe disorientation from reality and from rationality, and he cannot understand, and he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and the justification for his punishment.              But that's different from having a rational capacity to understand the nature and justification for the punishment.                  I think it is.     I would conclude it's a fair conclusion from the psychiatrist's affidavits and from their testimony, that he knows he committed a crime, he knows he's being punished, and he's going to be executed for that crime. But it stops there.      The delusions prevent his understanding.               I really do need your help on a procedural part of AEDPA.              Let's assume -- I know that you don't agree with it -- let's assume that the State erred because it gave inadequate procedures to the defendant with reference to the adjudication of competency to be executed.          Let's assume that. Would the district court have had discretion, if it made that finding, to send the case back to the State court to have new proceedings?               I was asking the question. So don't agree with me.               And it had discretion to do that?               No, no.         Assuming he made that finding.              What do you do if there's incompetency of counsel in a routine, not a death case, incompetency of counsel, and the district court finds incompetency of counsel?         It then goes ahead and he hears all of the issues that a competent counsel would have addressed, or it sends back to the State court?              In your experience and in your present position, have you seen many condemned people with the symptoms as severe as this defendant?                 I don't suppose you have statistics of how many have been sentenced to death and have later been found incompetent?
06-666 +++$+++                 I can ask your brother who represents Petitioner -- maybe I'd better should -- I'd get a better answer from him so far as his position. As you understand his position, as you understand the State's position, would it be permissible for State A to go to State B and say:                     We -- if you make your bonds nontaxable to our residents, we'll make your bonds nontaxable to your residents.              Do you find that consistent with the vision of the framers for our national market under the Commerce Clause?                I assume there would be a preference to Massachusetts milk for Massachusetts buyers, to Michigan automobiles for Michigan buyers, and the State did not subsidize.                -- authorities --
06-6911 +++$+++              And in the automatic category, I take it, it's usually after the sentence has been served?
06-694 +++$+++                  Well, I suppose if we were going to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent for us to reexamine our overbreadth rule.                 Your client here falls within none of these examples.                 He was convicted of having what everyone recognizes as not only child pornography but involving a very small child.                 And he knew what it was.        And he -- and he conveyed that belief. Given the fact that it would appear that child pornography is a growing problem, a serious problem on the Internet, maybe we should examine the overbreadth rule and just say that your client cannot make this challenge.
06-713 +++$+++              Well then, it's not just a rhetorical flourish.       It's true; when the State says that you take the position that you are entitled to say on the ballot who your nominee is, that has to be a correct statement of your position given this statute and given the issues presented to us here.             Or is that just somewhat hyperbolic?    It seems to me he is right based on your -- on the position you're now stating.              Suppose there were an empirical study that Washington voters know about this system, and that 80 percent of the Washington voters know that the party has not endorsed any one of these -- all of these candidates.          That it's just say a statement of preference, that that's all it means; the voters know this.    Is your position the same?              But -- but my submission, or my hypothetical and it's just a hypothetical, is that no one is misled by this.              Accept the hypothetical as true.    Then what's the injury?              What would be the validity or the invalidity, in your view, of a scheme which said that the ballot has one candidate who says, Smith, Republican nominee, and the other candidates -- other candidates say, Republican preference?              You -- you can't answer my question?   You can't hypothesize any legitimate State interest for doing that?              Well, when the Court writes this opinion, what's the fairest statement of the State's interest in this requirement?                   What do you think is the fairest statement of the State's interest?             You think there's no legitimate interest?      It's -- it's an unfair question, I suppose.             Well, I'm going to ask the State the same question.
06-7517 +++$+++                May I ask you this question about the rule:          It says before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure.               Can a pre-sentence report say possible grounds for departure are as follows, and then list them?   Or does this, in your view, mean that "identified for departure" means as recommended by the pre-sentencing report?               Well, could the pre-sentencing report just list a series of -- a whole series of factors saying these are possible grounds for departure?   Would that comply with the rule?               Would future dangerousness -- future dangerousness be something that could be put in the report and that would cover these --               That's the latest thing we're talking about very much.             That is an abuse of discretion standardized?             Unworkable or is there just as many impracticalities as the rule.

I think that requires 500 votes, and there was no specific finding that that was burden, was there?                     Or am incorrect?              What are your -- what are you best cases for that proposition?                But the State -- the trial court didn't find that that was a burden.
06-7949 +++$+++ 
06-8120 +++$+++               You're representing the State of California and you want to establish the proposition that any time there is a traffic stop in the State of California or I guess anywhere in the United States all the passengers are free to immediately leave, absent some further countermanding officer -- order by the officer.   I think that's a quite surprising proposition.   Now, we don't have empirical studies and so forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial notice and I think indications from the bench are we just don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel free to leave when there's a traffic stop.                    I just think you have no social or empirical documentation for that position.              But on your earlier answer to Justice Ginsburg, there's no authority in this Court to say that whether you deem yourself stopped or not depends on whether think you're innocent.                   There's zero authority for that, right?                Correct me if I'm wrong.                Going back to Justice Stevens' question, the passenger knows the minute the red light goes on that the police can either tell them to get out or tell him to stay in.                   He knows at that very moment.   That seems to me to substantially limit his freedom of action and indicates that --                Well, maybe our questions took your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond the question presented.         The question presented is only whether the passenger felt seized.                  If we agree with the Petitioner, do we send the case back?                Well, why, if we have serious doubts whether or not the evidence is suppressible?   All we've been asked in the question is, is whether the passenger is detained.                While the questions indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who cares, it's a lawful arrest.             Well, it may be that we would say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we have very little interest in applying the exclusionary rule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the concept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't been seized. Perhaps we should be very liberal insofar as applying the exclusionary rule and in this case it seems to me there is lawful arrest which is intervening cause anyway.   But I don't know that we should distort the law of seizure.               Yes, but in that case there was a blanket rule.             The officer didn't have to have a specific reason.           And that it seems to me indicates that that's because the person as a general rule knows that he or she is seized.                       If the officer had to give a specific reason requiring the person to stand outside as the dissent said, then you might have had a point.   But I don't think that's what the Court held.
06-8273 +++$+++               Is part of that because of what's involved in expectations?              That's the Smith case, where we said the determination of whether a constitutional decision is retroactive Is every bit as much a question of Federal law as the decision of the substantive right itself.         We said that in Smith.              And here the expectation -- in Smith it was the expectation of people in the private sector.      Here the expectation is one of finality of judgments.               -- expectations as being questions of remedy?               It seems to me that your -- your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier should be that there is uniformity.                     Some States are fast, some are slow, but in the end there is a final judgment which is a settled expectation, and the substance of the law honors settled expectations, which is finality.               And the concern is not so much a concern not so much for the defendant here but for the States, isn't it?          We don't want -- we think there is -- there is an important value implicit in habeas, and one of those values is that there be a limit to the degree to which we are going to upset the settled expectations of the States.            Isn't that right?              Well, I must say I have serious problems with your position in that regard. If you were not to prevail in this case and -- or, pardon me, if the Petitioner were to prevail in this case, and there were a ruling on what Crawford means, or doesn't mean, we could review it.                   I think the Petitioner is absolutely right on that point.              Isn't what you are saying is that the concern in Teague was not only with State court processes, but with settled expectations of those who are involved in the criminal system, particularly victims who are entitled at some point to rely on a conviction being final?             We don't usually think of just of settled expectations as being questions of remedy.   We consider those as being questions of substance.

06-923 +++$+++               Suppose that the insurance company shows or may be required to show, at least by the burden of production, that it has established firewalls, very careful procedures, written regulations that claims administrators are not to consult with the people that set policy and prices.                 Does that suffice to permit, simply, abuse of discretion review?              So that there is nothing the fiduciary can do in order to avoid intrusive -- highly -- a high degree of scrutiny in review of every close case?              So that all insurance company claims adjustors have less deferential review than independent claims administrators?              You want us to institute an industrywide rule differentiating insurance companies from other --             Suppose an insurance company -- I'll just repeat my earlier question -- has done the best that it can do to have a firewall, independence and so forth.         Does that bear on whether or not the less deferential standard of review is invoked?             So it makes no difference what -- it makes no difference what the policies of the companies are insofar as the standard of review?              This --              This bears upon the question Justice Breyer asked, which we never could get completely answered.      Can you tell me what the Sixth Circuit did wrong here?
06-937 +++$+++ 
06-939 +++$+++               Let me just be clear.       The statute with reference to State contractors, which is the $50,000 statute, and the statute with reference to private employers, which is the $10,000 statute, in all of those cases, the law is applicable only if the money is paid before all the work is done?             But on that point you're in disagreement with the Ninth Circuit, and --             So the principal rationale for the Ninth Circuit's opinion is incorrect in your view?
06-969 +++$+++               Is that called democracy?              We look at fighting words in a context.              It's one thing to say something in a bikers bar and another thing in the --              Are there many cases where we look just at the words?              You can't shout "Fire" in a crowded theater; it has to be a crowded theater.
06-984 +++$+++               And what you are saying -- and this has been the law --              Go ahead.               Then this is consistent with what you've been explaining to Justice Breyer in your answer, that for 200 years we have had some treaties that are very important, but they're not self-executing; their violation may put us in violation of international law; but it is for us to determine how we are going to comply with the international obligation; and there is no obligation on the part of the State to comply with that law because it's not self-executing.               At some point I think in the course of your argument, we may get back to whether the Vienna Convention itself is or is not self-executing.   I think the Solicitor General was correct in saying that that's a difficult word.            I think it is self-executing in that the State has to comply with it. I'm not sure that it is self-executing in that the State has to accept whatever procedural framework the foreign national demands.              And the United States apparently accepts the verdict of those --              You have three different things that you have to tell us about today:                    That the President's authority, the effect of the ICJ, and -- and the Avena judgment, and ultimately, the force of the Vienna Convention itself. And the only question I have that I need your help with is as to the last, and I hope that it doesn't interrupt the train of your argument. I think the ICJ -- pardon me, the Vienna Convention is self-executing, in that it requires the States to conform to the consular notification provision.                 Suppose you have a judge who has control over a defendant who's being held in custody pending trial, and the defendant says I want to see my -- my foreign counsel.               The judge says no.       Can you mandate that -- assuming State procedures allow him in, couldn't you mandate that judge to require him to allow the notification to take place?                 You see where I'm going?                 If I thought he did, would I still have to rule against you?             Could I make a distinction between failing to let him see the counsel at all in my hypothetical and a demand that the procedural framework be altered?    Isn't there a distinction between those two cases, do you think?             How many parties to Avena -- there were 51 -- are being held in the State of Texas?
06-989 +++$+++               But -- but the question is whether or not that streamlined process is the only process.     It seems to me that if the purpose of the Arbitration Act is to promote confidence in the arbitration process, that if parties agree to have the double assurance that the arbitrator hasn't made some strange ruling of law, that that's quite consistent with the whole purposes of arbitration.              But you're -- you're asking us to interpret the statute; and let us assume that it's a plausible interpretation and interpret the statute as the Petitioner would.              You know, under Section 8, the parties can use the authority of the court to libel a ship.      The court is extending its authority to -- to use very intrusive means, and to say that the parties can't ensure, if they choose, to have review for correct errors of law -- to correct errors of law when the ship has been seized, it seems to me to promote the whole purposes of the act.                Well, we're arguing about that textually.   I'm saying that there's nothing inconsistent with the Petitioner's position and the basic policies of the act.            You talk about finality, streamline, and so forth; but if the parties have more confidence in the arbitration process by ensuring this added level of review, it seems to me quite consistent with the purposes of the act.              Would you -- would you agree that what we hold in this case applies to suits in admiralty, where you don't go to State court under Section 8?             Well, at this point you don't have a State court fallback for your argument.             And I -- I can't say why it isn't -- I just repeat my earlier point -- quite consistent with encouraging confidence in admiralty arbitration to allow district courts to review rulings on a matter of law if the parties so choose.               And I would add --               I would add that in admiralty you don't have the back-up of State law.               Could the parties have an arbitration agreement in which they said, if there are contested issues of law, either party may seek declaratory judgment?               In a Federal court, under the Declaratory Judgment Act.               My hypothetical is it's in the arbitration agreement.          If the arbitrator gets stuck on a difficult question of law, either party can seek declaratory relief, and the arbitration proceedings are held in abeyance pending that declaration.             No.      There's the advisory -- we've been through this.            This is a real controversy, not an advisory opinion.             I think the reason you hesitated to answer yes might be inconsistent with your position. (Laughter.)             There are lots of other things for the arbitrator to do.               He's got some specific issues of law that are contested.
07-1015 +++$+++ 
07-10374 +++$+++               Suppose that the State of New York said that in suits against corrections -- against the corrections department, against the State, there should be no damages awarded to a prisoner in excess of $3,000; and then the --              -- and then 1980 -- and then the prisoner tries to bring a 1983 suit in State court.              Would the case -- would the analysis be just the same?               In my hypothetical, do you think it undermines the Federal claims?               But why can't it be argued here that Congress has an important mechanism in holding prison officials -- prison correctional officers -- personally liable, so that they are themselves aware that they have a constitutional obligation that is enforceable against them, and New York has taken this away? Now you may -- we may argue that if the State responds in damages, the prisoner is better off; but Congress has not made that judgment.                  Congress has made the judgment that the correctional officer himself or herself should be responsible.                No, it has made that judgment.   That's the whole purpose of 1983.                No, the correctional officer, under the scheme we are talking about, is not responsible in damages.               But -- does your case turn on whether or not there is an indemnification agreement?               I shouldn't think so. That hasn't been your argument so far.                 One of the concerns I have in this case is the scope of employment is often litigated, and it would seem to me that the State of New York might routinely say, oh, this is not within the scope of employment.                 Which -- which means that this is a very difficult distinction and is a further burden on the 1983 ride.                 I think that's a rather routine defense.   But why are they -- why are they left in the supreme court?             When was this statute first enacted?               1983 does not -- correct me if I am wrong -- does not allow punitive damages against a State, does it?             Not -- if I got that right, not in Monell.             Even in Monell -- even in Monell there is no punitive damages against the State, which is another reason you -- you were discriminating against the employee here -- against the prisoner. Because the prisoner could get punitive damages against the correctional officer but not against the State in either court.             In neither court can you get -- and correct me if I am wrong -- punitive damages against the State, which never --             He can under Monell.

07-1059 +++$+++                Can't we assume -- let's assume that there is.                 Assume that there are -- are two sources for the uranium, A and B, and it goes to the enricher.     A gives it; B gives it.                 A ends up with B's uranium.     Justice Stevens is saying at some point there is a transfer of title.                 No.      We are asking you to accept that hypothetical, so we can --                 Are you saying the utility doesn't have title to what was formerly B's uranium?                 The enrichment is done. It's back in the United States.                 The utility says:    This is my uranium.    I have title.             Do you dispute that?                 How does he get the title from -- to the uranium that was formerly B's uranium?              At what point did that title transfer?
07-1090 +++$+++                But there's nothing better settled -- well, perhaps that's broad.                    It is very well settled that the President is the one to determine who is the lawful and legitimate government that he would deal with.               That's all that was happening here.   And it's not just a question of one against the other.      It's a question of what government has survived.               And that is under -- and under the law something that has always been committed to the very large discretion of the President.
07-1114 +++$+++              Do you think that the material described by Justice Breyer would have been excluded by the trial court as irrelevant if it had been introduced, or cumulative as --             Do you think the prosecutor had an ethical duty to turn over this material?             Well, initially Brady leaves the judgment for, furthering Justice Souter's point, to the attorney for the defense.                      You're saying that the prosecutor can preempt the role of the attorney for the defense in deciding what to offer to the court as material?    And if -- and if -- and if -- even if the evidence is in a gray area, that's for the defense attorney to decide under -- under our Brady jurisprudence, as I understand it.                  Correct me if that's wrong.               It's outside the record and not really relevant to the case.                    Has he been on death row since 1984 or so?            And if so, is that solitary confinement?   Is he not allowed -- if you know?

07-1122 +++$+++               But that --              Well, we didn't think it was a factual question in -- in Brendlin.                 In Brendlin we said even when the wrongdoing -- this is at page 7 -- even if the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the passenger will expect to be the subject of some scrutiny.   And his attempt to leave the scene would be so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in the first place.    And that's why we held there was a seizure.    You're basically arguing with the premise of Brendlin.              Brendlin says no passenger would like -- would feel free to leave during the course of the investigation.       And -- and I would have to agree with that as a -- as a common-sense matter. It would be amazing to me that this fellow said:   I'm not going to talk to you anymore; I'm leaving; and -- and the -- and the police officer would allow it, particularly when the police officer, we know, searched the person.             You -- you don't concede in this case, or do you, that Trevizo had a reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous?                That has not been found for purposes of --             So even if you did not prevail, we would have to remand on that point?

07-1209 +++$+++                In your case did your client attend the initial hearing?               Well, what's the first time that your client knew that this claim was going to be processed at a particular time or the first time your client knew it had been denied?               I just was never clear on the fact of what happened.              If the notice was lost in the mail, so how did she know there was a hearing at all, or did she?              I'm just trying to -- it seems to me at the first hearing, if she in fact is there, they say, well, now you have to give us some notice.    And then at that point -- or some documentation, and at that point, at the initial hearing, everybody knows who has to produce what.              Is there usually an initial hearing?              Okay.              Well, the -- the statute says, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line of questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial error.   That seems to me to indicate that it has some discretion in how to decide the harmless error rules that it will apply, and that it knows more about it, in Justice Breyer's term, than either we or the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.                 Why can't I get that out of this statute?                Well, it just tells that the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.                That's fairly straightforward.
07-1216 +++$+++               Well, but I -- it sounds to me like that you are confirming my concerns.              Oh.      Oh, you're -- you are saying that if our law had been clear at the time, that she still wouldn't have given the instruction?              So your -- your contention is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case had all the guidance necessary to give the correct instruction --              -- before -- before we even announced the rule?              But we do that all the time in cause and prejudice cases.                  We do it all the time --              -- because of the importance of the constitutional right.              But it serves very little interest.    Nothing the trial judge would have done, nothing the plaintiff's counsel has done below, nothing that the intermediate clause would have done, would have -- would have been different if they had submitted what they call the "correct in all respects" rule. If they had filed the "correct in all respects" rule and submitted that rule -- if she had said, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper, everything would have been the same.              I excluded the Oregon Supreme Court from my list of -- of participants who would have done something differently.
07-1223 +++$+++              In that instance is there room for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing?              Can you envisage circumstances in which an ineffective counsel assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim was presented in the State court and then there is a second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on new evidence that the district court might hear?     Does that ever happen?              So you think there could be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second of which could be heard in the district court with evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?
07-1239 +++$+++              By the time this case got back to the court -- the district court a second time, the President had made a determination that this was in the paramount interest of the United States.               The Defense and Commerce Department jointly had made a determination that this is necessary for the national defense.   And it seems to me, even if those determinations don't resolve the EIS statement, they certainly must be given great weight by the district court in determining whether to continue the injunction. If you could comment on that, incorporate it also in what you were going to say about Mr. Garre's argument with reference to the standard.
07-1309 +++$+++               But -- but you -- you would instruct the jury that if these three thefts that are covered by RICO occurred over a period of a year, and they involved lookouts and scanners and so forth, you may infer from these acts an enterprise as defined by the statute?              You would allow that instruction?               Where -- where in your briefs or in the materials do we find the definition of what the enterprise is, other than in the statute, other than the terms of the statute itself?               I mean, in other -- what do I refer to in order to supplement the instruction that I just noted -- that I just suggested?               That's at the bottom of 111 where it said you can look to see what it does and make the inference rather than have -- I forget -- an abstract analysis?
07-1315 +++$+++                He didn't use the word "functional equivalent" in the portions I read.              Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong about that.               And he told the trial judge, "I've got an uphill" --               -- almost perpendicular. And he had -- each and every one of those experts in their affidavits, in their reports, had said that he didn't have deliberation or premeditation.              They were getting ready for that.        And he felt that this would be devastating cross-examination material because the jury had already found the opposite -- they had already disbelieved the expert on this point. Now, it's true, it's true, that knowledge of wrongfulness is probably slightly more extensive than premeditation.    But based on the defense that he was going to present -- he didn't know what he was doing at this time -- he had a very, very difficult obstacle to overcome.              So you are saying the judge had no discretion whatsoever?              But couldn't he also give life.   He could also give the maximum, which was life, couldn't he, or am I wrong?              Well, it's hard for me to believe that he didn't.        He -- he has tried a hundred cases.   He had moot or mock -- mock trials where he was asking the experts these questions with the co-counsel. And you want us to say that he didn't understand the law?   And there is no -- there is no finding to that effect.   There's no finding to that effect:                     That he did not understand the law by the magistrate.                By the magistrate, there was no finding to that effect.               But they didn't -- they didn't strike the experts' testimony.                    The experts testified at some length, the -- the psychiatrist.               So that was relevant to premeditation and deliberation, and the jury did consider what the mental health expert said.                 Please correct me if I'm wrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't -- don't testify as to the ultimate standard.                They testify as to the condition and -- and the symptoms of -- of the defendant, and then the jury makes that conclusion.              Has he served his time so far in a regular institution?

07-1372 +++$+++               Would you agree that there would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme Court said the Apology Resolution dictates our results?                Your whole case rests on a cloud on the title in favor of your clients.                    But you -- you ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered against the State.
07-1410 +++$+++              Well, give me an -- an instance in the statute that is in opposition brief of the orange brief at page 5.            Give me an example of why the last clause "and such disposition shall create no liability on the part of the United States," what contingency was that directed to if not the one that is before us?
07-1428 +++$+++              Well -- well, but you are loading the -- the equation.             The Chief Justice's question I don't think has been -- been fully answered. You are -- you are saying that you can eliminate constitutional concerns because the statute is enacted, which just repeats those same constitutional concerns. It's -- it's like having two tracks on the audio that don't quite fit.              I'd like to talk just briefly --              I would like to talk just briefly about this point that the -- some of our hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet. Here the test has been given.              And I had some concerns along the line of Justice Ginsburg's question.                 She said, well, it's not a vested interest. On the other hand, 2000e-(l)(2) says that test results can't be altered.               There's a statutory interpretation question of whether that means they can't be used altogether.      Two points about the statute. Number one, doesn't that diminish at least the force of the argument that this is a vested interest?    It means the tests are -- have a -- have a certain presumption in -- in their favor. Secondly, on -- and maybe this is a question for the -- for the Petitioners rather than you.                 If we -- let's assume that we relied on that statute and said that there's a Title VII violation here because the statute was violated.        I know you have an interpretational argument there.                Would that give the Petitioners all the relief they need here, or is there still additional relief under their 1983 cause of action?               It can't alter the results.   But let's not get into the statutory interpretation --
07-1437 +++$+++  
07-1529 +++$+++                Well, of course, they know -- it's a death case -- that counsel is going to be appoint -- or it's a murder case -- that counsel is going to be appointed.          Everybody knows that except this defendant.     He doesn't know; of course he doesn't know.               One of my concerns is that Jackson is a formality, but you're arguing for a formality on top of a formality.               I don't know what functional purpose is served by your position that he has to request the lawyer at the arraignment, especially when he's not versed in the law, he's in this stressful situation, and you require a formalistic request on the part of the defendant?       It just makes no sense to me.               No, you're requiring some kind of ritualistic phrase to indicate that he -- that he accepts the appointment.               That he requests the appointment.                 But this is still an artificial framework, because we know that in this case he has to have a lawyer under Gideon unless he waives it after being fully advised.            You couldn't rely just on -- on the failure to make a request not to proceed with a trial lawyer.    Of course he's going to have a lawyer unless after he very, very careful colloquy from the district judge or the trial judge, declines. So it seems to me that this -- this whole framework here is quite artificial.                       Now, I do think there's a Miranda problem here, if we accept his -- the defendant's testimony that the police told him, "oh no, you don't have a lawyer."            I know there's a factual issue on that.     And I -- I think the counsel for the Petitioner may not be quite correct in Moran v Burbine. I didn't have time to talk with him about that.                       There there was no misleading; they just didn't tell him that he had a lawyer.     Here, assuming his version of the facts is correct, they told him, "oh, no, you don't have a lawyer," they affirmatively misled him, and it seems to me that's a Miranda problem, if it's true, and that Miranda is completely sufficient to protect his rights.
07-1601 +++$+++              Well, is Shell liable because it -- it knew of the transportation arrangements?              Whether you have -- you might have knowledge that one chemical broker is more careless than another in the way the product was ultimately sold, I don't see why your theory doesn't make the seller liable as an arranger if it knows or ought to know that at some point in the distribution process there is likely to be spillage which will enter the waters of the United States.              I think that's what your argument implies.       I just don't see that in the statute.
07-208 +++$+++              Well, you've presumed in your answer to Justice Breyer -- I don't know if you fully answered all of the questions he raised -- that this defendant would immediately obey the objection. That doesn't happen.              So -- so you're presuming something that that's -- that's just inconsistent with the reality.    And you answered Justice Alito's question to say well, it's a legal matter; if it's a medical matter I don't comment.          But it's a practical matter; it's a commonsense matter.            We know what goes on, and what goes on is very costly to the State and to the fairness of the trial.               Well, you've got a record in open court here.               Well, Allen was a disruptive conduct case, where he was yelling and he was put out of the court. That's quite different from a defendant who pretends to comply with the order of the court and then repeatedly takes everything off track time after time. That was not Allen and I don't think you can cite Allen for the problem that most of these cases present.              Well, there's a difference between disrespectful and disruptive.                    And the Allen case was disruptive.       I mean, he was shouting, he was yelling.   Everything had to stop.                That just doesn't apply to the case we have here.               It's inapplicable.              Did the trial judge in this case cite the findings and the observations he made during the competency hearing in open court as -- for the support of the ruling?              What about the competency hearing that was held in open court with the defendant?                 Of course, one way to control these defendants is to say:                        Mr. Defendant, if you persist in this irrelevant line of inquiry, the court is going to consider whether or not you are competent under the Indiana standard to conduct your self-defense.    That would get his attention.                Well, now you're falling back on the very psychiatric evaluation in the first part of the trial that you disparage in the second.              I still don't know your "yes" or "no" answer.        Do you say he should have been found incompetent or that he should have been competent based on your present assessment of the record?              Was he competent to stand trial, in your view as you now understand this record?  nuts who could get 90 percent on the bar exam. (Laughter.)
07-21 +++$+++               And even so is, there anything that prohibits the State from confirming the validity of the registration at the polling place?              If we thought that the birth certificate requirement for indigent people was -- was burdensome, are there any States that have alternates to birth certificates?                Do neighbors come in and testify that this is the person?                    And I was going to ask the Petitioners' counsel if there's some areas where this statute -- where the central purpose and the central function of this statute can be preserved but there can be some reasonable alternatives for people who have difficulty?                If we did that, I assume challenges could be made in advance of the election.
07-210 +++$+++ 
07-214 +++$+++               I don't know that that accords with the definition of "claim" in (c).              It says the government will reimburse.              But I meant provide.     It has provided it already.             So in your own school hypothetical, there's liability.
07-219 +++$+++               Do any of those cases say the managerial agent is liable if he violated express instructions from an employer?              Because that's what the last part of your instruction 33 says.                  And it does seem to me that this captain may be managerial for some purposes and not others.         I think that's the way it's going to have to come out.          Maybe not.          But certainly he was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.              But they have not conceded the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33.                  And that's because he was not entitled to set aside the policy on intoxication.              No.      Your instruction says if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable to the corporation.     That's it.              So the corporation's responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply not relevant under your theory of the case, even though that's what you talk about in your brief.              So in your theory of the case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable? That's your theory of the case under instruction 33?              Or the last part of the instruction 36, I think.               Well, but that -- that goes to measures, not to liability.               That was the first phase. And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you have to explain.              Correct me if I'm wrong. You've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says that the appellate court has to examine de novo to determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award to deter.              Well, then, a fortiori, it gives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting as a common-law-type court.                 But the -- the United States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571, has exactly that number.           It's -- for -- it's double the pecuniary loss for a criminal act. And it seems to me, if when we're looking for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference to the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very valuable instruction.              But isn't the measure what is necessary to deter?         Isn't that what we've asked first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?
07-290 +++$+++               So in your view this amendment has nothing to do with the right of people living in the wilderness to protect themselves, despite maybe an attempt by the Federal Government, which is what the Second Amendment applies to, to take away their weapons?              I agree that Miller is consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to me Miller, which kind of ends abruptly as an opinion writing anyway, is just insufficient to subscribe -- to describe the interests that must have been foremost in the framers' minds when they were concerned about guns being taken away from the people who needed them for their defense.              You think Madison was guided by the experience and the expressions of the right in English law, including the Bill of Rights of 1689?                Or would you say like protecting yourself against intruders in the home?             Could it also be simply to reaffirm that the provisions in the main text of the Constitution remain intact?             But you were about to tell us before the course of the questioning began about the other purposes that the amendment served.                       I'm -- I want to know whether or not, in your view, the operative clause of the amendment protects, or was designed to protect in an earlier time, the settler in the wilderness and his right to have a gun against some conceivable Federal enactment which would prohibit him from having any guns?             That are not appropriate to --              It seems to me that Miller, as we're discussing it now, and the whole idea that the militia clause has a major effect in interpreting the operative clause is both overinclusive and underinclusive.     I would have to agree with Justice Ginsburg that a machine gun is probably more related to the militia now than a pistol is.                But that -- that seems to me to be allowing the militia clause to make no sense out of the operative clause in present-day circumstances.              My point is of any real relevance to the situation that faces the homeowner today?              Well, you're being faithful to Miller.     I suggest that Miller may be deficient.              But Just to be clear -- and I don't want to misstate your position, but my understanding, I at least inferred that you would consider it reasonable to ban shipment of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns in interstate commerce?
07-308 +++$+++               Were there any other cases where they said, well, it's not in the stream of commerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or anything like that?     Are there any complexities like that?              But in none of these cases did they have those sorts of problems?             Here there was a payment. Here there was a payment.             It's different than if you try to enjoin the collection at the outset.             So that argument doesn't work.              Well, but if we -- if we accept your view in this case, they can go in a district court and enjoin them.         It's not a tax.            The Tax Injunction Act doesn't apply.                And -- which is just what Justice Ginsburg's questions point out.                   And earlier I had indicated that in this case they did pay the tax.                So it seems to me there is a distinction.     It may be that you would prevail in your argument.                If they tried -- if they tried -- do you think they could enjoin the collection of a tax refund?                But, I mean, in your argument you say it is absolutely -- that it doesn't apply.   Just get an injunction.              Well, then we'll invent the hypothetical company that is going to go broke and all that stuff.              But you can't have it both ways.   You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes, and then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go through the tax law.              And the same with your answer, what I thought was your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.              Is the interest the same in amount in either case?
07-312 +++$+++ 
07-320 +++$+++              It's not just money.     It's not just money.    It's the quality and kind of speech. You're saying, the government is saying, the statute says, that the underfunded candidate has less access to coordinated expenditures with the party than -- than the other party -- than the other candidate.                 And the cases have acknowledge, the statute acknowledges, that coordinated expenditures have a particularly potent force, and you are saying candidates are treated differently in the access to this kind of speech. And I know of no precedent of this Court that says one party is entitled to assistance from a certain segment and another party is not, based on the -- the content of the speech.               And that's exactly what this is.             But it's in the statute and it's part of the challenge.             I agree that it's been given a relatively minor position, but it's of great concern to me because it puts this Court, it puts this statute, in the position of preferring one kind of speech over another.     And we simply do not do that.             Are you saying that argument is not properly before us when we are judging the validity of the statute that's been challenged?               But the provisions --              The provisions of the law which prefers one candidate over the other with respect to coordinated expenditures has an impact on campaign strategy.              Mr. Solicitor General, you're defending this statute on its face, I take it.              And it seems to me that this is a facial invalidity of substantial proportions.             Do you want us to write an opinion which says that independently wealthy candidates generally have different sorts of views than other people?
07-330 +++$+++               Well, if this were to be a more frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we were to rule for you and court of appeals generally would do this, then a defendant might think twice about appealing in a complex case.              Because there's nothing that could happen -- once the district court rules and the seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that anybody can do to raise it.
07-343 +++$+++               Both -- both sides have something of a dilemma with Coker, because if you say that it does not control this case, then the consensus or the lack of consensus -- or the consensus is more reliable.    If you say it does control this case, then the consensus is not so reliable; and both sides have that duality that they have to confront.             But there was some indication that in most cases the prosecutors, in part to see if they can get a plea bargain, begin by saying they're going to charge with the death penalty.                 And I'd like you to comment on prosecutorial discretion.                 Again, it cuts to weight.      In one sense, it's -- it's a check, so that only the most egregious cases are covered. On the other hand, there's a temptation to overreach, and it's an argument that Petitioners make for saying that the death penalty should not apply.             If you were asked to draft this statute that we have here and you have just the definition of the first statute with the -- what we call aggravated kind of -- and you have the age limit, would any other limiting categories occur to you as being inconsistent with sound statutory drafting and sound policy?             And that's prior conviction --             -- not prior offenses?
07-371 +++$+++ 
07-411 +++$+++               Do you think it's inherent in Montana exception number 1, that an Indian tribal court in the course of adjudicating commercial dealings has the capacity to elaborate common law?              Tribal common law?              And you think that's necessary for regulating consensual relationships?              Well, and I suppose --              Well, suppose it were the first occasion?   I mean, what's the rule?                    That doesn't help me.              In other words, if you go -- if you make a mistake 14 times, you're bound to 15? That's kind of an estoppel.              In your view, does jurisdiction follow all regulatory authority?                If it's within regulatory authority, then is it your position that there is necessarily jurisdiction to enforce in a tribal court --             -- in civil cases?             In your position, is regulatory jurisdiction concomitant with civil judicial jurisdiction in the tribal court?
07-440 +++$+++               Then how could they hold them in jail?               He was held after he saw the magistrate.    Suppose he had been held for three months and you couldn't make bail, we don't need counsel?               I am asking what the constitutional rule is.               We have here a proceeding before a magistrate; this results in custody.                And my question is, suppose this were weeks, would counsel be required to be appointed?              If we said that when a defendant is ordered held in custody, that there is then a right of counsel, would we be contradicting any of our precedents as opposed, say, to extending them?              Well -- no.     But my assumption was assuming that the defendant is remanded to custody.    I added that.                Can you give me -- can you give me some idea, or some empirical assessment, or tell me where I could go to find out, as we sit here, how many people are being held in custody after a probable-cause determination and do not have counsel appointed for them and do not have the right to have counsel appointed to them until some other critical phase takes place?                So then there was just a misapplication of the statute here when this man was held for three days, and then he requested counsel?             Well, I'm talking about the first phase before there was an indictment, just the probable-cause phase.        You say even then there is -- under this Texas statute there is a right to have counsel in one day?
07-455 +++$+++              I take it that one of the reasons you make your argument is so that if you prevail and you go back to trial, you would argue that this is not in relation to?     Is that correct?             If you prevail in this case and we say "in relation to" is part of the statute --                 -- and then you go back to the trial court, I assume you will argue to the jury that the government can't show that it's in relation to.                 That's right.                 But it seems to me that in a prosecution, in this prosecution, it might be somewhat difficult to establish in relation to.                 And that would be -- even assuming the jury was properly instructed, et cetera, et cetera.                 All right, but doesn't that show the necessity for the very interpretation the attorney general has argued for here?                      It is just too difficult to establish and very dangerous?               You think on this evidence, on this record, that a jury, if it were instructed to -- that it had to find "in relation to" could return a conviction of guilty including the "in relation to"?               If this case had been instructed according to your theory of the statute and on this record and on this evidence, could a jury find your client guilty?               That's exactly why the attorney general says he needs it.
07-463 +++$+++ 
07-474 +++$+++                Do you think Olech was correctly decided?               And public employment is different just because it's going to be a big problem? What --             Well, but we're presuming that there is an objective reason for promoting or retaining -- the person has a college degree and so forth -- but that that person is rejected anyway because of dislike.             That's the hypothetical. Why is that hypothetical case different than Olech?             But then we say that there is a subset of unusual cases where we will allow the cause of action?               I'm having trouble hearing both the question and the answer.              But we are concerned about the case -- let's just assume, just take it as a hypothetical case -- where there is an arbitrary and vindictive reason for hiring the employee and it has nothing to do with race, sex, or other recognized suspect or improper categories.               And I thought your answer to me was, well, I might make an exception to that.               It seems to me that you want us to write an opinion that says there are some instances where the government can act arbitrarily and unreasonably.             And that's because of existence of other avenues of redress.              I understood that the argument --              But what authority do you have for us to parse different governmental actions and say some are subject to the Equal Protection Clause and some are not?              Other than the convenience of the government -- it might be more efficient for the government -- you want us to say that the government can act arbitrarily with respect to employees?              But a public employee applies for a 30-foot easement that he is entitled to, and doesn't receive it; and the mayor says and by the way I don't like you, so you're fired:                    A, you don't get the easement, B, you're fired.                Why -- why do we treat the cases differently?         Other than the floodgate argument etcetera?              But that just states your conclusion.   I want to know why this is.               So we should cite there is no constitutional right to be a policeman?                   We can revise that?
07-499 +++$+++               Well, but your position is that it is unbounded.        If the legislature passes a statute requiring specific intent, scienter, concepts of personal responsibility, we don't say this is unbounded.              I'm saying in the general criminal law.     We don't say, oh, this is unbounded. This is what courts are for.              This is what adjudication is for, is to establish and define what duress means, what scienter means, what degree of intent is culpable, what isn't.     It's not unbounded.
07-512 +++$+++                Well, you don't certify questions; you certify orders.               And in the certification of this order, I take it, your position was in support of what the district court did and in support of what the court of appeals did, correct?               You made -- you made -- you made an argument, or did you not, that is consistent with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?              Was the court of appeals' decision consistent with the argument that you made to the court of appeals?              Is the first -- is the first time that you indicated that you were in agreement with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you filed here in this Court?              But it --              -- it seems to me that, in that instance, you seriously prejudiced the Petitioners here, and that that should be weighed heavily against you when you ask to -- for permission to amend your complaint in the district court.             I mean, there have -- there have been costs and time --             Nor did you give notice to the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.                Has the Brooke Group complaint been allowed in the district court or was it --                 Yes, it was?              Well, would you say that absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to deal here?              No.      No.    My question was Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws? Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a duty to deal is because of the regulation.                   So, you use the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the price.   And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.             It's still seems to me that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal.                And You rely on the regulation that far, but you don't want to go to the regulators to -- to argue about the price. You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust law second. Why can't we just look at this case as purely antitrust; and then, as Justice Breyer said, if it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.
07-513 +++$+++              Is there a 1983 violation here?             I suppose if the concern were that the police would become sloppy, then a 1983 suit would be more likely?             And there are three reasons.   One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so they don't have the hazard of felony arrests. Number two is?              And if there were pervasive deficiencies, I assume that's exactly what we would inquire about under 1983?              And would you add 1983 as number four to your list?             Do we use the word or the phrase "good faith" in writing the opinion if we write it your way?              In Hudson versus Michigan, didn't the Court engage in a very broad balancing of the social costs and the potential for increase in violations in saying that there was no necessity for the suppression rule in the no-knock case?
07-526 +++$+++              That, seems to me, not to help you, because if they are the same, then that would apply to both. Justice Breyer was suggesting, as I had earlier, that maybe you can make a distinction between those were under Federal jurisdiction then and recognized tribes now.               The Chief Justice's question, and I was going to put the same question to Mr. Olson, is whether or not there is -- is some canon of construction, some principle of Federalism which makes us be very cautious before we take land out of the jurisdiction of the State.           It sounds to me plausible. Is there any authority for the proposition I just stated?   Have we said that in cases or --               Or have we said the opposite, that there is no --               But is there any overriding principles about which we must be most cautious before we interpret the statute as depriving the State of the ownership and jurisdiction of this land?    Is there anything in the cases either way on that point?
07-542 +++$+++               But the absence of dominion or control works the other way.               That makes it all the more dangerous.        That could be -- there could be guns that other people could get out, evidence other people could get out; and, rather than go through a case-by-case analysis of whether this was true in every case, we just have a bright-line rule as Justice Scalia said at the outset.              It seems to me that the absence of the dominion and control is -- is just a conclusory statement to explain what happens in the case the person is arrested, but it -- it doesn't seem to me to provide a rationale.              It actually works the other way, because it means there is more reason to search.   It's not in our dominion and control.                 We are leaving it on the street.          We want to know what's in there.              That is what they are asking about in this case.
07-543 +++$+++              But -- but doesn't the risk or the potential of a fixed-fund pension plan where employees who are not parties to this action receive less?   Isn't there at least that possibility?             And shouldn't that possibility be weighed in the decision of this Court?              I think that's the line of questioning here.             And there's no realistic possibility that some pensions are based on a fixed fund which has been established already?             But I take it that this decision you want us to write applies across the board to all plaintiffs.               Well, when you say there's relatively little amounts of money, can you tell us what amount -- what the maximum amount would be involved? Are you --              Would it be less than $100,000?              Would it be -- for the whole suit?              Would that be a million -- a million dollars?              But that -- that's a small amount of money, a million -- millions of dollars?
07-5439 +++$+++                 So you're standard is that there has -- well, don't let me misphrase it for you, but there have to be other obvious available alternatives.                So your safeguard one is the only -- you have against Justice Scalia, endless litigation, or does your threshold two do the same thing.              Did you mean to say unconsciousness.
07-544 +++$+++ 
07-552 +++$+++               Can you tell me is this 1,400 causes of action or is it one?              How does that come about? Suppose a lot of people owe the bank -- a lot of farmers owe the bank money, can there be assignment in this one cause of action?              And how does the law express the metaphysical process in which 1,400 causes of action become one cause of action?              Well, there is not a representative cause of action.              What is the magic point at which it becomes one cause of action?              I'm still missing something here.    Can you give me an example of where this has happened in other cases that this Court has heard that are commonly heard?              I interrupted you and I talked over you.   Every Rule 23 cause of action and what else?               Well, associational standing, Sierra Club v. Morton, they are interested in an ongoing injury in which there is a common -- in which there is a common injury.           These are liquidated amounts.             Those are usually ongoing injuries as to which there's a common interest in stopping the injury.        Here you're aggregating liquidated amounts.                I might understand it if was some sort of injunction actions -- in the future please pay what you're supposed to pay.                But that's allowed because the requisites for class actions have been met and that's authorized by the rule.                That's not true here.             There are a lot of better procedures that are in the rules but it is not in the rule.             Do you agree that this could not have been brought as a class action?             Why didn't you bring it as a class action?             Then why didn't you bring it as a class action?      We can all go home.               But why do we have Rule 23 that requires certification of a class action?                     If you can say, well, I don't need Rule 23, I'm going to take 1400 claims and make them one any way.
07-562 +++$+++               Would you have -- would have you been satisfied if your complaint said this complaint does not seek any damages based on the link between smoking and health?              Would you accept that amendment to your complaint, that the plaintiff does not seek any damages based on some link between smoking and health?               So what are your damages?                Mr. Frederick, if I take away from your oral argument that it is your position that this suit is not based on a link between smoking and health, I'm going to have difficulty in accepting your position in this entire case.                   Do you have a secondary position that it is based on a link between smoking and health but it is subject to a general duty, that is, that supersedes or is quite in addition to labeling?                 Your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question was that the state attorney general could not impose a regulation that said you must say that low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular cigarettes.    If the attorney general couldn't do that, why could the plaintiff do it in his lawsuit?             No.      The hypothetical was the attorney general requires this as a regulation under his authority.
07-581 +++$+++               Suppose the employer did have the practice that the Chief Justice suggested, it tells each employee you have to sign an arbitration form, could the union in its collective bargaining negotiations say that you will withdraw this forum and that you shall not impose this obligation?              I'm asking in your view if it came up to it, how would that be decided --              Because I'm concerned it's the same thing as the Chief Justice mentioned, I just don't think the employer is going to get very much under this interpretation.      And that may, ultimately, hurt the employee.
07-582 +++$+++                 I'm not sure that works. I haven't looked at the statistics on one-parent families, working parents, and so forth.                  Those factors both have to be considered.
07-588 +++$+++ 
07-591 +++$+++                It seems to me -- and tell me if this is not the way you want to argue.            It seems to me to make your case you have to say of course this is hearsay; and the question is whether it's testimonial.                And it's not testimonial because these are laboratory protocols, subject to ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific to the case.    That's the kind of framework of the argument you have to make.                And that as a result of that it is not testimonial because "testimonial" is a legal term that's subject to interpretation.               I -- I guess that's the argument you're making and that you have to make.                As I see it.                Of course the problem was in -- I think it was Hammond was the companion case to David.                 The -- the 911 call was done for other -- really other purposes.                  It wasn't testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial. This does seem more directed to trial, so then you have to tell us why even if it is, there are some independent guarantees of -- of reliability that means that we should say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.              Well, do you have to have a machine?    I mean, what about -- what about ballistics? "This bullet came from that gun."                  Does that involve sufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the expert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug testing doesn't? It seems to me that's where you have to draw the line.             And to say that that wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the question we are going to have to decide if you're going to prevail.    I don't think it helps to say it wasn't raised in the case.             We are raising it.             I do wish you would comment on the argument that the State of California -- a huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems to get along all right under the rule that the Petitioner proposes.             If the State of California and other populous States have for, I take it, some number of years been able to function quite effectively under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to me that's something that you have to address.                Why would it be undue for California and not for -- are you accepting the fact that in California it's a workable rule and it's caused no problems?             That's a non- answer.          We are asking what's the rule?                Can you submit it on the affidavit, as the Chief Justice said under your theory of the case?                You'd try to have some different hypothesis?              But you have to have some boundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to have some explanation.         You started talking about a machine.    There is no machine in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, so it seems to me you have two different rationales floating around here and -- and neither are tethered to a specific rule.                Well --              It seems to me you have to do that because there is all sorts of machines that have to be interpreted.      There -- a chromatic spectrum analysis; the person has to say what he saw there, what she saw there.              So just because the machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a sensible rule based on that.              Could you comment on the California experience, please?
07-6053 +++$+++              If it was -- if it was testimony.   There are a lot of declarations that are not testimonial, and the rule is very important for those.             There are also declarations that are testimonial, in which case we look to the confrontation concept.             But to the extent that Crawford is confined simply to testimonial statements, any number of statements --             -- that will come in under the California evidence rule are simply not controlled by the Confrontation Clause anyway.                    It's just -- it's a standard hearsay problem.               Does the record show or did the trial indicate anything that he told the police on the prior occasion?        They went into different rooms and they each gave statements?               Well, I think it's an astonishingly broad exception you're asking for.                     On the other hand, testimonial statements are all that's involved, and so that's a narrow class, and maybe that balances out.    I'm not sure. But may I just ask and you can comment on it if you -- may I ask:       The defendant gave notice that he would testify?               California law requires that?               Or it does not require it?               All right.             Suppose the unavailability is caused by the defendant's negligence.                 Defendant negligently runs over the victim.             I mean over the declarant.             Suppose it's negligence.
07-608 +++$+++              -- that that -- that that doesn't particularly help you.               Elements usually refer to each component of the actus reus -- you entered a dwelling with a weapon.         You would say "elements" for that, wouldn't you? And it seems to me under your interpretation the statute should say "elements."               Well, I mean when we are gasping for straws I'm not sure anything is insignificant.
07-610 +++$+++               Well, one of the difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position with the sort of all or nothing approach.                 But you seemed to be taking the mirror position of that.                    Your argument is all or nothing on your side.                 I don't get much help from either side as to what the standard should be.   I know germane is obviously a malleable word, but we are looking to see if there is some test that we can use that's not all or nothing.              I haven't heard from either side yet what that would be.
07-615 +++$+++                 But how is that affected -- how is that affected depending on whether or not the judgment is executed or not.              Would the Iran tribunal have the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the judgment, but to just hold the funds?                I don't know that it's the subject of the award.        And it's really not at issue; it's just recognizing that there has been some prior transaction.             But Iran might say in the tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this claim that we brought against you, the United States, implicates a breach of obligations that you have that are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment.                And then the United States would say, no, that's not true.                So they would have to examine the Cubic judgment.                So that means it's at issue before the court.             There might be in the setoff proceedings.     There might -- there might be an argument that there are two obligations, and there is a setoff or that there is a setoff.              Well, I think we might get --              -- substantial -- a substantial degree of argument on that point.
07-636 +++$+++                  Well, are the provisions of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?             Did the Court of Appeals give short shrift or overlook that point?             Would you like to argue the question that is here?
07-665 +++$+++               Those are time, place, and manner regulations, with which we are all familiar.                   But my concern is that this -- this case is an example of the tyrannies -- of the tyranny of labels.                   Because it's a public forum, as Justice Scalia indicated, for parades, for protests, which are limited temporally, it -- it -- it just seems wooden and rigid to say to all of a sudden say, well, it's a public forum for something that will last 30 years for which there is only limited space.     It just doesn't make common sense.             You're saying the last generation had much more freedom than the present one?             Well, your -- you can stick with it as long as you want; that's what the -- the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say that we were unconvinced by the comparison between speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy. Would that be the end of your case?
07-689 +++$+++                 Intentional by those who draw the district?              I won -- I'd hoped that you could have a brief time to discuss your third rationale because it's going to require determination of how people would vote.
07-6984 +++$+++               Well, you're saying that (2) has a negative implication.              You are saying that (2) had a negative implication.            In other words, the time shall not be counted while it's pending and that it should be counted if it's not pending and you are not diligent.
07-751 +++$+++                 Well, you would agree he could make the -- the arrest by himself.                  Assuming he was a police officer --                -- he could make the arrest by himself.             But -- and -- but you are saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest effective in all cases.        There has to be some exigent circumstance.             Well, it seems to me that in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are exigent circumstances.               Well, that -- that's a different point and I have some question about that.              It seems to me the police are never quite sure exactly what's going to happen.              It seems to me that this is an area where the police do need guidance, and I need guidance.   I find this -- I find this very difficult. It seems to me that we could have learned a lot if the -- if the courts of appeals had addressed this question.             Which is what they do in Saucier.             Which is what they would do under Saucier.              So the police say, you know, we made a mistake.           We should have had a warrant, but we have our man in there now, we have got to do something.     The police cannot send assistance?               No.      You say they have created the exigent circumstances.               So -- so my first statement was correct.         It's illegal for the police to send their assistance, the other officers in?               And you say as a practical matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can endanger -- we must endanger the officer?               No, no.         The hypothetical is that they have to send people in to assist him.                     But the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent circumstances.              It seems to me that dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on your proposition that if the police create the exigent circumstances, they cannot rely on it.                  I seriously question that proposition.              No, no.         I want to talk about the general rule.              You want us to write an opinion saying that any time police create the exigent circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had the time to get a warrant.         And I find that a dangerous rule.
07-77 +++$+++                But suppose they didn't have that footnote.      Suppose they said:               We hold it void ab initio.   Then, what's your answer to Justice Scalia's question?             I'm not sure that in those cases you had what you had here, which was a declaration, let's assume, of invalidity ab initio. Let me give you this hypothetical.                 A county council goes to the board of commissioners or the board of supervisors of the local county or legislative branch and says:   The legislature has just adjourned; it passed a lot of laws, and one of the laws it passed is that that you now have to set the qualifications locally for certain officials, so we have to act on this right away. They pass the legislation.                 Three weeks go by.   The county council says:            You know, I made a mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed by the governor.    What rule?           What result?              Well, suppose it had been precleared?             That's not just an implication.    That's your whole theory.
07-772 +++$+++                 The gloss that the Washington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the same as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in this case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the state of the law was, got it right.             Was there an objection?              The objection was based on the defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely, close to the model penal code that says you have to have the same -- is anterior principle, and that's not necessarily the law in every state. So the defense bears some responsibility for not -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent theory either.              No objection from defense counsel.               And your answer to Justice Breyer incorporated the -- the principle that the defense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of this case, that you must have the same scienter as the principal, and that's not necessarily the law.               It can go on in some States but not -- it doesn't have to be the law as I understand it.
07-773 +++$+++              Speaking of gymnastics, can I ask you if you had foreseen this problem, could you have brought a declaratory judgment action to establish that your Federal claim --             -- controls this dispute and could you have then said that you wanted this arbitrated?             Why didn't you do that? Why are we here?             I mean, could you still do that after this case?             Is the Petitioner's -- I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to ask the Petitioner -- is the Petitioner's argument for a limited look through compromised in any way by the Beneficial Bank case which allows removal if there is a Federal defense?             That's of course in the context of a defense, as opposed to a counterclaim.
07-8521 +++$+++              The government's principal concern in this case is the possibility to potential, assuming the Petitioner prevails, of appointment of counsel in State post conviction collateral proceedings, i.e., when there are unexhausted claims.               Apparently the Sixth Circuit in bank addressed this, and in your brief you indicated there is a number of additional claims. Is that the principle thrust of your concern rather than clemency?                 You think there is no way to interpret that the statute so that it could include state clemency proceedings but only federal post conviction review proceedings in judicial -- before judicial tribunals?
07-854 +++$+++ 
07-869 +++$+++                Now --         Let me just establish something at the outset.    You had conceded below, and I thought I saw this in your brief as well, that as to the State of Idaho, its determination not to allow the deductibility is permissible.              All right.      So, we begin with the proposition that a State may do this if it chooses; i.e., this -- refused on its own to have the payroll deduction.              And if -- and if a State had a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by local entities -- were routinely controlled by the State, the State did all the pay roles for the local entities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility would also be permitted, I take it.               Suppose the State at the State level says this is a contentious area, we want to stay out of it.   We are going to be neutral.           We are simply not allowing payroll deduction for right to work clauses, for union clauses.            We don't want this.     If the State can say that, and your concession indicates to me that it can, then why can't it tell its subdivisions you have to be efficient, we don't want arguments from one city to the next city about payroll deduction that's going to consume the time of the city council's, the time of the citizens, we want to take this off the table for you just the way we've taken it off the table for us?                Well, of course, that's the interest.   This is a very strong Federal interest in allowing the States to organize their governmental systems the way they choose.             Our gun control registration case, where we said the Federal Government cannot tell the counties that it has certain duties for gun control.                I -- I -- I'm not sure that's right.   I'm not sure the State isn't saying we want to determine how our government is structured in this respect.              I'll read Russo again, but I didn't think Pocatello, Idaho, was part of the state of major.              Could you help me with this?    Would you object if we analyzed this as a constitutional condition case?               I don't know that you would prevail or not.       But it -- the forum analysis doesn't seem to me to quite fit.              Why is that? (Laughter.) MR. COLLINS -- the problem with constitutional condition -- if it were a condition on the local governments, then it's not really --
07-901 +++$+++              Are you saying it would have to be a bifurcated proceeding?                Is there historic evidence that bifurcated proceedings were required before Apprendi?                But statutory interpretation questions aren't for the jury.
07-9712 +++$+++              Just to explore the issue of breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same facts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired and objected to in the district court.             The defense attorney says, well, now, if you look at paragraph 8 and so forth, and the government says, well, Your Honor, well, he committed another crime.           And then the judge says -- and we are not going to move for the recommendation.                        And the judge says:     I will assume that you made the recommendation, and I will just tell you right now I wouldn't take the recommendation anyway.                      I'm not going -- I wouldn't give a lowered sentence even if you made the objection.       What result?                Is it?          Because in Santobello there was no reason given for the prosecutor to violate the plea agreement.                Here there's a good reason.   Can you distinguish Santobello on that basis?
07-984 +++$+++               So do we decide -- we decide this case on the assumption that this is fill? Do you agree that this is fill?              Well, then the question that we've put earlier is whether or not a single pipe contained both, and you say that it can contain both.              It's one -- visibly, it's one stream, but you say it consists of two things.              Is it both slurry -- is it both fill and non-fill?             You say this is 404; it's not 402 --             It is 306?              But it is fill.
07-9995 +++$+++               What -- what case would you cite for that proposition?             And you can't say Michigan versus Long.             Isn't this Johnson versus Standard Oil and that sort of thing?              For the reasons that have been discussed, it may be that we won't get to the merits of the Petitioner's argument, but assuming we do, the Petitioner talks about the -- I don't have -- the "unlawfully constituted jury."              Is -- is -- what is the extinction distinction between the hypothetical case of the juror who isn't a resident of the county and the State says you have to be a resident of the county -- what is the distinction between that and, say, a non-Article III judge sitting on a court of appeals panel?   Why is one structural and the other not?              And this would -- this would be a little different than the juror who might be biased or might not be biased, because this goes to a hard qualification.     It's just a hypothetical in the case, but it's a -- it's a linchpin to the Petitioner's argument.              Well -- but the hypothetical is it doesn't -- the juror doesn't satisfy the requirement because he or she is from the wrong county.              What was that case?              Oh, Illinois --               I will use that as an examination question but let's hope it doesn't come up.              But don't some of those courts, rather than focusing on the qualifications of the particular juror, look to the -- how close the case was?              There are any number of alternatives that we can adopt in ruling for your position.   If we were to rule for your position, what do you think is the most straightforward rationale?

08-103 +++$+++ 
08-1065 +++$+++                What's -- what's -- what's your best authority for the proposition that there's liability in the case the Chief Justice put?                 What's your best case?             You will have to refresh my memory.    Wasn't that a Fourth Amendment violation ultimately?             So that -- so that's not --                Well, could you answer Justice Breyer's question, which I -- I think raises a -- a critical point in terms of Justice Alito's examples of talking to the witness.            Why isn't that at some point -- I think in Buckley, the "judicial phase."                         Why is this the judicial phase?                No, but probable cause doesn't work because you have -- you have probable cause once you fabricate the evidence.              That's circular.              Suppose the prosecutor isn't sure there's probable cause and he calls -- calls in the accountant, the CFO, and really doesn't begin to believe his story, so he starts probing and finally he gets the CFO to change his story with the plea -- plea bargain.   Would that be part of the judicial process? Or is that still clearly investigatory?              Well, he's trying to find out.   That's what --

08-1107 +++$+++ 
08-1119 +++$+++ 
08-1134 +++$+++              I didn't hear.     Proper --             I was going to ask whether or not in -- on the facts of this case, the client could have waited until the final judgment, not appeal, but then come in under Rule 60?             So then the client is not required to -- the creditor is not required to appeal?             All right.    So I don't think they could have -- and of course, you don't think it's void.   It could come in under 60(b) if it's void, but you don't think it's void.             All right.    So you have to show mistake or surprise, and you doubt that there was a mistake or surprise here.             Let me just ask this and maybe I have bankruptcy law wrong.                My -- my understanding is that if creditors are not listed, they are not discharged, correct?             I think that's right in most cases.    If you don't list the creditor, the creditor is not discharged.             I'm -- if you're having problems with this --             I m just wondering, doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not listed and then they come in later and say the debt is not discharged?    I mean, doesn't that happen all the time?             And is -- is the rationale that that -- that that discharge would be void as to them, or that they are just not covered? Suppose the bankruptcy judge makes a mistake and lists a creditor by name as being discharged, but that creditor never received notice.             Is it void?             Well, is this -- is this case all that different, then?             He got notice of something that was void.             I mean, that -- that -- that assumes that he got notice of something that was legally improper.              Well, I'm not sure there was proper notice.     There was not a notice that there would be a contested hearing.             Or that there would be an adversary hearing.              I'm -- I m not sure that there was a proper notice.              Well, of course that's the problem in the case.     Sometimes we decide cases that don't make a lot of difference and that once we decide the rule everybody will know what the rule is.             But in this case, the Petitioners say that if we adopt the rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted, it's going to be extremely burdensome and costly on -- on municipalities, on -- on those who give student loans, et cetera.          And that -- and that you are just creating a tremendous burden on an already overburdened system.             On the practicality point, you talk about electronic notice.           I suppose that that -- that the creditors for student loans could have the automatic electronic thing where they say, we insist on a hardship hearing.    But that doesn't solve the problem, because they d then have to go back and see whether or not there was a hardship hearing in the case. So that -- that means they have -- they have -- they have to -- they have to inquire into every case whether or not the proper hearing has been made.             Oh, you mean they can't ask for a hearing unless there is a reasonable ground to believe that there is no undue hardship -- can t even ask?
08-1175 +++$+++              Could you tell us where that is?   I think you mean page 479, but I'm not sure.                What page are you on now?               We could write that down. It could be the next case. (Laughter.)                Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that's the case.     The remand in Long was only to address another issue.     The Long Court took its determination as being binding on the issue that was before the Court in Long --             -- in that case.             And in each time, it said that it was by extension from Miranda.             It always linked it, and that was the question that was presented in the State court --             -- that it certified.             That's the whole reason we have jurisdiction, so that Miranda will not be confused, and so that it won't be a hazard on the landscape when people say "Miranda" and they mean something else.             And it's not at all clear that the Washington -- that the Florida Supreme Court could in this case go back to the Constitution.                That's -- you can't get that out of Long.             It's -- maybe in some other case.    Not necessarily in this one, because Long leads to -- to the contrary.             But you have no case in which the Florida Supreme Court has explicitly said that we have a warning that is more strict, more rigorous than what Miranda requires?          You have no case?              Well, except the words that it quoted from the lower court opinion -- that is, we are talking about the -- the Fifth Amendment, and by extension, Article I, section 9.              So that seems to me to indicate that it s incorporating, not going further.              I think the opposite.        I think the repeated linkage shows that they think they are the same.
08-1191 +++$+++              Is the government going to tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign exchange test, is based on considerations like those suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge hypothetical?             Would the limitations on discovery give you substantial protection were we to adopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange test with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes account of the government's test?             Is it a consideration that this discovery alone would be an offense to foreign -             Suppose there were litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause of action under the securities law.                     Would -- would the fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in this suit?   Or would the test be just the same in your view?             Well, then you give no weight to the fact that it was on the Australian exchange?
08-1198 +++$+++ 
08-1200 +++$+++ 
08-1214 +++$+++          Do you take the position that the cause of action for interference with a contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is concerned?         What is your position on that point?         Do you -- do you -- does your client take the position that that law is correct, that the Federal law has pre-empted State law actions for interference with -- with contract relations?         All right.     So then you are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional interference with contractual relations?         Well, isn't that the effect of your argument here?          But if it's outside 301, where does pre-emption come from, Garmon?          If I could interrupt just for a moment?    Allis-Chalmers was 301.          Allis-Chalmers says 301 covers contract, and, therefore, there s a pre-emption.    So I take it you re not talking about Allis-Chalmers pre-emption.          You are talking about Garmon or Machinists or something.          But if you say both of them, then we re back where we started.            If 301 pre empts, then it should be within the ambit of 301's jurisdiction to the Federal court.
08-1224 +++$+++          I didn't hear.   You think they have a power to --         Because the government --         Well, suppose, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, he caught the communicable disease in the prison as a result of poor prison conditions.         No, no.        The hypothetical is that his sentence ends, and they want to commit him to a Federal health facility.         Yes.           Well, there is -- there is in the sense that the relation between the prisoner and his or her State is disrupted for, say, 15 years, and then this person is just a derelict.
08-1301 +++$+++ 
08-1314 +++$+++ 
08-1322 +++$+++              I m having trouble with this aspect, and it may -- may be that it varies from State to State.    But as a general matter, under State law, let's say that the employee makes a contingency fee arrangement with a lawyer to sue the employer and wins $50,000.   It's a one-third contingent fee.                The -- the employee already owes the employer $40,000.                  It would seem to me under the general principle of offset that the employer has to only pay $10,000, and the attorney is not going to get his full fee.             And that's just --       that's just the law of offsets.             Because again, it's the same party.    If they created money by suing some third person, then that's different.             And -- and so I -- it seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for is just contrary to the standard law of offsets.             And it's even worse because the Federal statute says that there shall be this offset first as a matter of priority.             Well, in the generalized sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described to it, sure, the attorney has a beneficial interest, but he's not going to be able to collect it vis--vis the employer who is entitled to an offset.             Do you calculate the fee under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending on the case?     Do you ever calculate it under both so that you get some under each?             The -- the -- you calculate it under both so you get some under each?                Right.
08-1332 +++$+++              I certainly -- criminal defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want to look at these.    They would want to see if there is exonerating evidence, under the rule that all exonerating evidence has to be submitted.                      It would seem to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens' question indicates, that there is going to -- that these are going to be discoverable.              But you re not -- you re not a police officer who is making arrests.                      I mean, this -- this is part and parcel of determining probable cause and mitigating evidence.             And he's talking with a girlfriend, and he has a voice mail saying that your call is very important to us; we ll get back to you? (Laughter.)
08-1341 +++$+++               Well, except that I think most trial judges would have admitted this evidence with the proper instruction to the jury, that it's background evidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and just begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to them.              Now, I agree there was not a proper instruction here, there should have been an objection, and so forth.      But in an ordinary trial, this evidence would have come in with the proper limiting instruction.             Of -- of -- of course, the jury would have to be instructed very carefully.              And this was a long -- a long jury deliberation.             Well, you can be pleased that I was not the trial judge. (Laughter.)               Well, I -- I thought what we have said that it's just a violation of due process to convict someone for conduct that was not criminal when the conduct was -- was made.                 It's -- it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process violation.   It just -- it's a serious due process violation.
08-1371 +++$+++               Well, there are very few universities.     But why doesn't this just all work out? If the Christian Legal Society has these beliefs, I am not so sure why people that don't agree with them want to belong to them.      What -- doesn't this all just work out?               And doesn't it work out that the Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican club and run for officership anyway.               So why -- what s -- what interest does this -- does the school have in this policing mechanism that it's imposing?              It's also never happened from, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with this group has applied for membership.              I mean, that's -- that's what so puzzling about the -- the case.              The predecessor group --              -- and obviously uncomfortable with their position, so he or she left.              That's the way it works.              And what if we think that the policy has not been evenhandedly applied?                 Can't we decide the case on that basis, and then we could just assume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice Stevens' question.              Let me just say, suppose it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you d have no problem with our saying that it s then unconstitutional.
08-1394 +++$+++                Excuse me.   What was the page?   Nine --               Were -- were these colloquies that are reported, the -- the pages we have just been reviewing, heard by the entire jury pool?               Or were they just -- where the person -- the juror was standing in front of the bench for this?             It's hard for me to think that the voir dire would have been much shorter even if there had been no showing of pervasive prejudice.             Five hours sounds to me about standard for a case of this difficulty.             Well, a concession that a bribe or a kickback scheme statute would not be vague is hardly a concession that this statute as written is not vague.   In fact, I thought that was the point.             The point is that the Court shouldn't rewrite the statute; that's for the Congress to do.             What authority do I look to, to see that some employees are fiduciaries and others are not?              If I look in the Restatement of Agency, and they have a section that applies to fiduciaries and non-fiduciaries, both of whom are employees?              I would assume that any employee, even at the lowest level of the corporate structure, who has corporate property, a car or something, has a duty to protect that car for the employer.
08-1402 +++$+++          Well, that's policy. Can't you say that that is systematic exclusion because it's part of the system?
08-1423 +++$+++        Well, in their brief, the brief for the National Library Association indicates at the bottom -- the American Library Association indicates at the bottom of page 38 that "made" might mean cause to exist, cause to appear, and so that it applies the first time that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so that if you lawfully import it into the United States, it would then apply at that time.       And it makes the exemption work, then, too.       Well, in your example, if there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good, then if you interpret "made" as causing to exist of appear or under these laws, as the library brief suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate.
08-1438 +++$+++        And I'm -- this one question may be covered, but can you give me any examples where States have turned down money under the Spending Clause, say we don't want it, the restrictions are too great?     Does this happen all the time, or ever?       Where States tell the Federal Government:     No, thank you, we don't want the money.       Under programs like this?       I mean other States - they say, oh, the liabilities are just too great, we don't want it?       You -- you have already addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of your friend on the other side of the case is that with the Spending Clause you have a contract.     The State has some extra protection, and therefore we need not be quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers of immunity, because you have the contract. Can you comment on that argument?     And - and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is potentially so sweeping that the State should have special protection and we should be particularly careful about the clear statement rule. Or do you think the clear statement rule applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth Amendment?
08-1448 +++$+++        Why couldn't you make the same arguments with respect to the obscenity statutes?       Why shouldn't violence be treated the same as obscenity?       Well, the courts -       The courts struggled for many, many years and are to some extent still struggling with obscenity.     They came up with basically what we might call the Miller standards.     And -- and the State has said this gives us a category that we can work with, with reference to violence.       You could make all those arguments with reference to obscenity.
08-1457 +++$+++              Well, I don't know how you could write the sentence without the "ed" unless you want to say -- to make your point, if the statute had been written the other way, to any group continuously being designated.             Suppose -- suppose our first inquiry were agency law, and we concluded that under agency law when the principal ceases to exist the agent may no longer function.            Let's assume we conclude that under agency law.      Could you then cite us a case or a rationale for saying that agency law should not apply to a government agency, to a problem of this type, and if so, what is your authority?             But that is like the de facto officer doctrine.          It could be that, if the Petitioner prevails here, the de facto officer doctrine would leave in place everything that has been done.              But it seems to me that's quite a different -- different point.             What -- what authority does an ALJ purport and in fact exercise?              He's not acting or she's not acting for the board?             Under the Petitioner's theory, if there is no quorum would those appointments then be invalidated, too?
08-146 +++$+++               Well, what do you do with third party beneficiary assignment assumption?               Well, in a way that was where one of the parties, without the other party's consent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary.               Here in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement to come into play.      That's their theory.
08-1470 +++$+++              What's your best authority for that proposition?             Well, he -- he didn't say anything.   You -- I think you could say that his conduct implied the very kind of statement that Justice Alito suggested in his hypothetical:             I'll listen to you guys for a while.             I thought, in order to test his knowledge of English, they asked him to read one or two paragraphs.              I don't see how you square that with Moseley.               Your argument would be the same if this was compressed to 45 minutes? Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
08-1498 +++$+++               Can they -- can they advocate to the association?              There are many kinds of advocacy.     You can advocate to the world that they are right.   Can you advocate to the association that you should change your ways, that you should use Lexis to find international law precedents, et cetera?              And suppose the organization's board of directors agrees with that and wants them to address the general membership on that point, and they are doing it with the blessing of the organization.                Do you stick with the argument made below that it's unlawful to file an amicus brief?                I think I'm right in saying it that that was the argument below.             But Justice Ginsburg's question is:     Can you advocate peaceful means?                 And let's assume that if they embrace peaceful means, they get more interest in their organization, the organization becomes stronger for all purposes.                Can you do that? That was Justice Ginsburg's question.              And here's how to do it. And here's how to go to the U.N., and here's how to apply for aid, and here's how to file an amicus brief.               But -- but I have the same --               I had the same question as Justice Stevens.   It's a very odd as-applied challenge because there hasn't been a prosecution.             And vagueness as applied, I think as Professor Cole can answer, is, it seems to me, if, you know, that it applies, it isn't vague. I don t understand that, but --               I -- I can't -- I can't think of a case in which the Court, pre-prosecution in a declaratory judgment, has said that it's improper as applied to certain things.         Or maybe I'm wrong.      Maybe I am missing some case.
08-1521 +++$+++              And it was also the Harlan view, although a separate opinion in the Griswold case and in Poe v. Ullman. Do you think that it best describes the approach that the Court has used over the years?             I was going to ask Mr. Clement what test he thought the Court used.              If you looked at all the cases, you think implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?             But I thought its rationale was that because of its fundamental character, the right to bear arms must be understood as separate from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all people, most people in the United States.                 The public meaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an individual right to bear arms, and that's because it was fundamental.     If it's not fundamental, then Heller is wrong, it seems to me.               What is the due process liberty --             But would self-defense be part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of the Due Process Clause?             And you ve given -- you said there were two reasons.            So you have given us both in your answer to Justice Alito's question?             Without repeating that and just so I understand your position, how could some member of the Court write the -- this opinion to say that this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was correct?              But there -- but there are provisions of the Constitution, of the Bill of Rights, that have been incorporated against the States, where the States have substantial latitude and ample authority to impose reasonable regulations, rights respecting -- rights respecting property, the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.     We look to see what the political process does.   We look to see -- why can't we do the same thing with firearms?             Do you think there is existing authority with reference to other provisions of the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate just the core of Heller with respect to the States? Just the core of the Second Amendment with respect to the States, along the lines to this question Justice Stevens was asking earlier?             And if so, what's -- what case do we look to for that proposition?
08-1529 +++$+++                And Carlson is your best authority for that?     Even though I don't think Carlson is directly on point, Carlson is still your best authority?               In a different context, but that -- but Carlson is still your best authority for that proposition?
08-1553 +++$+++              Well, how -- how does the Chief Justice's hypothetical work with the language of the statute?   They -- it just goes to Los Angeles and it -- there s a railroad track right by -- by the wharf, and it's the Union Pacific Railroad.
08-1555 +++$+++               And your red light has gone off.    I could just add -- make an addition to that same question.     I would agree that the State Department might have some expertise in telling us what the facts were:     Who was the government, who was -- who was in office at the time, what the policies were. But it's just not clear to me what body of principles the State Department looks to, to make this determination that, as Justice Scalia said, Smith is immune and Jones isn't.             But I take it your answer to Justice Scalia with reference to the indictment against the Secretary of Defense, is that that's not covered by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.                 And if a state interprets international law to allow the suit, then it goes forward.               But that just goes back to the Tate letter era, where we wait to get an e-mail from the State Department to tell us what to do.               I thought that was the whole purpose of the Federal -- of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
08-1569 +++$+++                That s -- yes, that s Harris.         What's the -- I don't want to interrupt your nice organization here.            But what is the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to support the distinction between 30 being necessarily an element and 7 a sentencing factor?            What's the general rule here?         Other than, this is just --         -- other than how awful this is.         Please.              Is that just based on empirical studies or is there guideline support for that?          I understand.     I understand that.        It's a collateral point Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't you have to find that the machinegun is operable?
08-192 +++$+++                  The call -- does the call have to be completed -- I mean, if he gets an answer saying "Your call is important to us, but we're serving someone else"? (Laughter.)              Carry -- carrying a weapon.   A lot of statutes punish more severely for carrying weapons.              But it -- can you tell me, how does it work?    The district -- the United States Attorney in one State, one district, has a case like this where there are four different phone calls; and he doesn't like the looks of the defendant, or for some reason he can charge him, and in the neighboring jurisdiction the United States Attorney does not.               Are there guidelines?    Does the Department of Justice control this in each case?           Is there some manual where we could see what the rules are for charging?               Is it all at the discretion of the United States Attorney?
08-205 +++$+++               But that judgment was validated by Buckley's contribution-expenditure line. And you're correct if you look at contributions, but this is an expenditure case.              And I think that it doesn't clarify the situation to say that for years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work at all have to have a speaker-based distinction, exemption from media, content-based distinction, We've never allowed that. time-based distinction.              But if you -- if you insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in Thornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati?             What about the Thornhill doctrine?             It is not cited in the briefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant without standing to object to a particular form of conduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order that the statute does not have an ongoing chill against speech.    And there is no place where an ongoing chill is more dangerous than in the elections context.              So you are asking us to have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied challenges which are based on, as I indicated before, speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly against.             Let me ask you this. Suppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations could not be covered by the statute.                   Would that -- would the statute then have substantial overbreadth?             But suppose we were to say that.   Would the statute then not be substantially overbroad?             But I am asking you to assume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction. Then the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall because, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the language.             But under your position, if corporations A, B, and C, are called to Washington every Monday morning by a high-ranking administrative official or a high-ranking member of the Congress with a committee chairmanship and told to tow the line and to tell their directors and shareholders what the policy ought to be, some other corporation can't object to that during the election cycle.         The government silences a corporate objector, and those corporations may have the most knowledge of this on the subject. Corporations have lots of knowledge about environment, transportation issues, and you are silencing them during the election.              When other corporations, via -- because of the very fact you just point out, have already been used and are being used by the government to express its views; and you say another corporation can't object to that.               In the course of this argument, have you covered point two? (Laughter.)               And I would like to know what it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.             And to undercut Buckley in so doing?              But he was talking about contributions in that context.            That's quite clear.             You say it's been on -- it's been on the books forever.             But, No. 1, the phenomenon of -- of television ads where we get information about scientific discovery and -- and environment and transportation issues from corporations who after all have patents because they know something, that -- that is different.         And the -- the history you applied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of expenditures.
08-214 +++$+++                Well, surely there will be some incidents in which the employer in good faith thinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for               For you to tell me oh, this will just never happen, I mean, that's not the way the world works.              Well, of course there are going to be disputes, and the question is whether or not, just from the standpoint of filling professional responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if we agree with your position, which changes completely the settlement and the bargaining aspect.               But you can address -- you can address that.               If I thought that the lack of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal point or a relevant point for our decision, other than the representations of counsel, where would I look to verify that?               The -- the -- that there is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take maintenance and cure cases.
08-22 +++$+++                I want you to be able to elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance standard has -- has much to recommend it.                   In part it means that you don't have to inquire into the actual bias; it's -- it's more objective.                   Now, of course it has to be controlled, it has to be precise.                   But I just thought that you know that I -- I do have that inclination.               And we're asking -- we're asking what substance we can give to the constitutional protection.                I -- I think you're quite right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is that the reason -- why is appearance never constitutional?     Why should that be?                   Can you talk about that?              But our whole system is designed to ensure confidence in our judgments.              And it seems -- it seems to me litigants have an entitlement to that under the Due Process Clause.              And then debt of gratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running out, have you said what you need to say on debt of gratitude?
08-240 +++$+++           But Justice Breyer asked you for a test.   Maybe this would help you.           If you are the trial judge, how do you instruct the jury to determine when there has been a constructive termination?            You have to have an instruction.          I'm quite frankly amazed that you say you don't have a test.          You re coming up here and telling us that there s such a thing as a constructive termination, I mean -- but then you don't have a test for it?         I may be incorrect.      I -- I thought your friends for the Petitioners said there is no case in which there s a constructive eviction but where the lessee remains on the premises.             Maybe I misheard. What is -- what is your principal case where the lessee remains on the premises, but there is a constructive eviction?         -- that says the dog doesn't bark.   I mean, there is this huge body of landlord/tenant law, and you have just a few cases, and one of them, at least, doesn't appear to support you.
08-267 +++$+++              You might say that there is a lurking constitutional question and that we ought to interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional concern.             When you say it's lurking, you're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional avoidance?             Okay.             In the civilian courts or the military courts?                Well, let's assume it raised because Justice Breyer asked the question --              -- and I would be interested in the answer.                In coram nobis cases in the civil system, do courts appoint special masters when they're an appellate court and they have to find out if coram nobis was --                Or do they use district courts as special masters?                In this case, the court had to invent a procedural device:                   There's going to be a new court-martial, which is a little odd because it's a new court-martial sitting in judgment on somebody who isn't even in the military any more.                 But all of that is extra-statutory in your -- this instance?
08-289 +++$+++              Well, it seems to me very odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision which says funding must be equal in each district.               Then you find one district that's way behind, and that is, we will assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing language education.     You are saying that if the court orders more money spent for that district, it must automatically order money -- additional money for every other district in the State?              But -- yes, but that seems to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the answer you gave Justice Scalia.              But, again, what you're -- you're saying that any time a district court in a single district orders more money to remedy a constitutional problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to every other district.      That just can't be.              And if -- and if it is, then that is a very good reason for the district court to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.              Did the district court on the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its incremental funding determinations that it had made earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?
08-295 +++$+++               Well, as to the 1986 order it seemed to me that the counsel for the Petitioner might have answered the question posed by the Chief Justice with the traffic accident hypothetical:              That is an interesting question of subject matter jurisdiction, and maybe there is subject matter jurisdiction, maybe there isn't, but that issue as to the 1986 order is final.     Now, that brings us to the -- the later order, 2004, 2006.     And then the question is whether or not that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a further expansion of jurisdiction that could be reached. Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have given that answer?                But, putting aside questions of notice, if these parties had been represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it was incorrect; but it's done.                So then it's just a question of personal jurisdiction and notice.             It is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction, because subject matter jurisdiction can be concluded in an earlier order and there can be no collateral attack if you've been a party.              Settlement clauses often release future claims; standard stuff in a release clause.              But that is subject matter jurisdiction and that is foreclosed.                     Now, if you are talking about personal jurisdiction that may be something else.              But you're talking about subject matter jurisdiction and that has been foreclosed by the earlier Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion.                     And the court of appeals' opinion that we are reviewing now seems to conflate that issue.
08-304 +++$+++                I'd like to go back to Justice Ginsburg's very first question.                   I want you to assume that in category 1 it means State or Federal. Maybe you disagree, maybe you don't.                   I want you to assume that.   If we assume that, does it make any sense to confine category 2 to Federal only?               And what's the practical -- your answer was, well, that's because -- I want to know the practical rationale for that, the practical reasons why that should make sense.
08-305 +++$+++               Suppose we thought it were sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the school district is presumed to have made the correct diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case, that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it out of the sky. Is -- is there some authority in the statute that would give us warrant to do that?                   Or is there some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to establish a presumption of that kind in order to recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do some work?             If the --             If the parents are entitled and the child is entitled to the special education and the school doesn't give it, and there are two schools -- private schools in the community, A and B.   A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the other is considerably less.            And they both have adequate programs for the child.        Is the hearing examiner entitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is the parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the more expensive school?
08-310 +++$+++                Well, it says "vessels of all kinds are liable to taxation as property in the same manner as other personal property."             But your answer it seems to me does put the issue squarely before us in the terms that the Petitioner has presented, that is to say, sure, suppose you tax the vessel and you tax trailers and small vessels and a lot of other things, but as to all of the latter category, you have -- you have an exemption.   So the -- the only people that effectively pay the tax are the tankers.             And I thought that that was the way the case was presented.                 Now, the question is what is imposed here?     My understanding from the yellow book -- do you agree the yellow brief is accurate in its factual descriptions, perhaps not in its conclusions that it draws?                 See, we have a problem with the facts here.        But my understanding of the case, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that sure, Valdez has tax authority and tax statutes which would cover a considerable amount of personal property on an ad valorem basis.    But because of exemptions, only the tankers pay this tax.               Was my statement correct?             How do you define revenue base?              But the answer to Justice Stevens's question is we can take this case as presenting to us the fact that the ships pay more than other property?              And you say that doesn't make any difference.
08-322 +++$+++               Well, is the burden that the Act puts on the State irrelevant consideration?              How many people in the Department of Justice -- what's the Department of Justice budget for preclearance processes each year, do you know?              Thirty attorneys.      Do you quarrel with the assessment -- the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that it costs the States and the municipalities a billion dollars over 10 years to comply?              But you think that is -- that is relevant?              But yet -- yet the Congress has made a finding that the sovereignty of Georgia is less than the sovereign dignity of Ohio.              The sovereignty of Alabama, is less than the sovereign dignity of Michigan.       And the governments in one are to be trusted less than the governments than the other. And does the United States take that position today?              Well, then my point stands.   You say that there is a basis for treating States quite differently as to the -- this fundamental right that we all agree on with respect to voting.              And what's happened in part is that because of section 5 preclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is protected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered jurisdictions.              This is -- this is a great disparity in treatment, and the government of the United States is saying that our States must be treated differently.    And you have a very substantial burden if you're going to make that case.             No one -- no one questions the validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the Voting Rights Act.    The question is whether or not it should be continued with this differentiation between the States.    And that is for Congress to show.             Well, the overall historical record, Katzenbach said there had been unremitting and ingenious defiance, and that was certainly true as of the time of the Voting Rights Act. Democracy was a shambles in those -- that's not true anymore, and to say that the States are willing to yield their sovereign authority and their sovereign responsibilities to govern themselves doesn't work. We've said in Clinton s New York that Congress can't surrender its powers to the President, and the same is true with reference to the States. Wouldn't you agree?                In covered States as opposed to noncovered States, if I can add that to the Chief Justice's question, please.                Just one thing on bailout. It's like Eurystheus keeps telling Hercules, "Oh, you did a good job, but now you've got another -- got another thing to do."       That's the bailout provision. Anybody who has tried to fill out a government form realizes they make a mistake, so that the DOJ rejects it, that counts as a rejection.               You have to have a -- what, a clean record for how many -- how many years -- before you can preclear?         I mean, this is simply impracticable.    And it seems to me a cornerstone of the Act and of your argument for upholding the Act, and if we find that it doesn't work, that it's just -- it's just an illusion, that gives me serious pause.             I think that's absolutely right.   Section 2 cases are very expensive.                They are very long.   They are very inefficient.                I think this section 5 preclearance device has -- has shown -- has been shown to be very very successful.                 The question is whether or not it can be justified when other States are not covered today.             Well, the brief filed by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think makes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory acts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor Percelly, makes an important point about crossovers in different -- my concern is it's just not clear to me that Congress addressed this for the rest of the country.   That's my concern.

08-441 +++$+++                 The Solicitor General says, well, this is going to affect Title VII.                  It's going to affect all kinds of other acts.                This is a watershed.             You -- pardon me?             Because it's statutory.             Let's -- let's assume we have authority to incorporate the Title VII jurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice. Are there reasons why there should be distinctions between the two regimes?             Are there reasons of administration or fairness other than -- I recognize that one is statutory and the others would -- would be our case law.
08-453 +++$+++               Does any of this bring us back to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between Justice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many States?              You -- you began on that, and I never did hear --
08-472 +++$+++ 
08-479 +++$+++                I'm not quite sure where we are in your answer to the question of the Chief Justice's question.     He asked you a hypothetical case. And you said that's a nonstarter because in this case. And the hypothetical is that there is a very dangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and consumed that afternoon. Does that make a difference in the permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of the search and the scope of the search?               So you don't mind our judging this case as if they were searching for meth?               That's the way -- we should -- we should judge this case as though they were searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen, have I got that?   The fact that it was ibuprofen is irrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were meth?                 I don't think I understand that based on your answer.            I'm -- I'm asking you -- you said that the nature of the drug makes no difference, It's a nonstarter.                 Insofar as the rule that we -- that's because in this case you don't think there's a reasonable suspicion to begin with.                 But that doesn't answer the hypothetical.                 We're trying to announce a rule.   And your rule, your submission, as I understand you and as I understood the government, is that the nature of the substance they're searching for is irrelevant.                 So that goes back to my earlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the case as if this were a search for meth that was going to be consumed at noon?                 Thank you.              Let's go back to Justice Souter's question.      We assume that there's meth, something very dangerous, going to be smoked at noon, there's very strong suspicion of this student.              The assistant principal says I'm going to give you a choice: we're going to engage in an intrusive search, same sex people, like what went on here; or we're going to call the local police department, we'll have probable cause to book you and they will search you at the jail house. Which do you choose? Would the school administrators be violating their duty if they did that?              They give the student the choice.     They say we'll do it here with a nurse right here, where you know everybody, and there's nothing wrong' or we'll call the police, and they'll do it down at the police station.              Which -- which would be the less traumatic of the two choices for the student?              You think it's less traumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have uniformed police officers take the person to the police station and conduct the search there?              You want us to decide the case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for the student?              In the hypothetical wasn't there a probable cause?
08-495 +++$+++              And -- and why would you be reluctant to do that?         Would you just spell that out a little bit?                 I suppose your answer, it's your first argument, it's the -- it's the offense.              And if for Blockburger purposes or for double jeopardy purposes, you couldn't retry him for those other -- for that additional loss, then that's -- I assume your argument is that that's included within the offense for which he was convicted.              Your position is that in ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?              That's my point.             I take it that that's your whole argument.
08-5274 +++$+++ 
08-538 +++$+++              But she could have said in full.    You can't say she couldn t have done nothing more.   She d put  in full.             Or  100 percent of value.             Now, you ve said that there s nothing else she could do, and I said, of course, there s something else she could do.            In Taylor, the case you cite, they put  unknown.             I mean, I understand your position, but you can't say there s nothing else she could have done.   That's -- that's the issue in the case.               But how do you know that from the form?   Number one, I think both sides have -- have an argument as to what the form means.              I don't think it's at all clear-cut.              As I say, I'm looking for some kind of a rule to tilt the case one way or the other.   All right?    I don't put a lot of credence in the fact that she -- the ambiguities are construed against her. I am concerned that in every case, under your rule, the trustee is at risk unless he makes an objection, and I think that's just going to make bankruptcy proceedings much more protracted and much more complex.               Well, but therein -- the problem was triggered when they put in the word "unknown."             You mean in every single case where an asset is sold, there has to be a valuation beforehand?             If -- if he claims the whole property is exempt?             My question was  - I thought I understood your remark to say anytime there s a sale, there has to be a valuation or an appraisal before the sale.             But that -- but the very fact that it s -- that there's going to be a sale may indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.             Well, once again, Taylor had the word  unknown,  and this doesn't.              And that's the problem.               You mean if the trustee thinks there's a problem?
08-586 +++$+++ 
08-598 +++$+++ 
08-6 +++$+++               But can we get an answer to Justice Alito's question -- a hypothetical, the one he put -- could you put that condition on a statute or a rule consistently with the constitutional of the United States?                Well -- well, let's assume that counsel and the defendant -- after full discussion and being fully advised, say this is too dangerous; we don't want the DNA test; we'll shoot the dice; we're not going to have the DNA test.              He loses.        Can you then get the DNA test?   Or, as Justice Alito's question pointed out, could you have a condition that when you've made this conscious choice, you lost your right for later DNA testing?   That's what he asked.               I still don't have the answer.              Well, you seem to be sympathetic to that position.             But as Justice Alito's question again points out, what you are doing is setting up a game in which it would be really unwise to have the DNA test.   Take your chances.              You have a -- you have a built-in -- you have a -- a built-in second chance.              And that's just -- that's just not sound trial strategy, counsel, and you know that.             On that -- on that point, I just want to make clear:           In the present posture of this case, I take it that if the Federal Innocence Protection Act applied, he would not qualify?             He --             Well, but -- but as the case now stands he does not qualify.               As the case now stands, he does not qualify.               You're -- you're, in effect, asking us -- and you would say the -- the Solicitor General appears here -- you're -- you're, in effect, asking us to say that the Federal Witness Protection Act on these facts is unconstitutional.             May I -- may I just ask one point.             I take it he is not now in custody for this offense?             Not for this offense?             He's being held on other changes.             But he's not now in custody for this offense.
08-604 +++$+++  
08-6261 +++$+++              But can we get to the Brady?    That was one of the questions I had, too.                  Let's say we have the -- we'll call it a private person as prosecuting.             Does that person have a - a right to look at all the government files to see if there is any exonerating evidence?             I mean, how does it work? That's what we want to know.             But how does it work? Does -- does the -- does the person who is bringing this prosecution have the right to go in and -- and look at the -- all -- all of the files that the police have -             -- and that the prosecutor has?     That's the only way Brady would work.             Criminal -- criminal contempt prosecution or civil contempt prosecution?             Well, there can be order to show cause, but you are saying that every state allows a private person to have a criminal prosecution for criminal contempt?             Well, a -- a motion is different.               Then the courts decide - then the court decides based on the position of the defendant, of the person who is charged with contempt -               -- whether or not to proceed.   And the court certainly can appoint a prosecutor, and does in many states.              Well, if there were a finding of innocent, or not guilty, by this prosecutor, could the official prosecutor then prosecute again, or would there be double jeopardy?               If you are saying they are somehow separate, does the double jeopardy clause apply?                Well, but that was the same authority.                So you don't think this is a Bartkiss-like case, like Bartkiss v. Illinois?                That a State prosecution doesn't bar a later Federal prosecution.
08-645 +++$+++             Well, you could say that the limitation on the custodial right is the right of the husband to visit once a month or 3 -- 3 weeks a month.     I -- I think that's slightly an artificial approach.            But that -- that cuts both ways so far as you are concerned, because it includes -- might mean that custody includes the right to insist on living in a specific country.            But, textually, that s certainly plausible.            I had one question for the other counsel and didn't have an opportunity to ask it.   If the Respondent were return to Chile, would she face criminal charges or contempt charges?            Well, but the ne exeat order --            And I was --            I was going to say the ne exeat order, under your view, is the one order that can't be enforced anyplace.            But that -- but that's a defense to a removal order.
08-651 +++$+++              Well, then you are saying that the more the defense counsel strays from his only professional responsibility, the more at risk the government is.     That seems odd.              Well, why shouldn't we just adopt an amendment to Rule 11 in which the judge says, any collateral consequences with respect to your plea are not the concern of this court and will not be grounds for setting aside this -- this plea?             Well, everyone at the counsel table I assume agrees that the plea has to be voluntary.   But  voluntary  has various meanings: Number one, it is not coerced or forced.            Would -- isn't your argument that  voluntary  does not include being fully informed?             Well then, about important collateral consequences.     Is there -- are there any cases that address this point one way or the other? That is to say, the extent to which  voluntary  includes the component of being informed about major consequences, significant consequences of the plea?              Can I go anywhere to -- to read a discussion of this?
08-660 +++$+++  
08-661 +++$+++             Well, do we have to ask what was the intent at the beginning, as kind of an originalism thing?       Everybody sits around and says: Let's have a football league.               And 20 years later, they say:     You know, the sale of hats and shirts is a pretty good thing; let's get into that business, too. That would -- that would -- that's case 1. Case 2 is, when they formed the league initially, 30 years ago, they said:                  And be sure we will sell hats, and -- I don't understand the base point from which I find that this is a single entity.            Well, do you take issue with my question that this is a relevant inquiry?              Is it part of the original agreement or isn't it, and why is it that the original agreement is somehow sacrosanct?     I don't understand.
08-67 +++$+++               Well, on that first theory, and your theory that a retrial on hung counts is always permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of appeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on that point, or am I incorrect?              A different question Suppose you prevail.     The hung counts are retried.          And the jury hangs again and the jury hangs a second time. Is there any point at which the district court can intervene in the exercise of its own authority and discretion just to dismiss the charges?             Then the government can try year after year to get a conviction and were the defendant down?    Nothing the Court can do so long as there's a hung jury?             Is that the rule in all of the States?    Don't some States give authority to the judges to say, enough is enough?
08-674 +++$+++               But the rationale is the commonsense notion that it's a presumptively reasonable rate, and if that's true, how is that altered by the identity of the party that attacks it?                Well, why is -- why is it not presumptively a commonsense notion when some different party attacks it?           It -- it's still a determination that this rate, as a commonsense matter, is presumptively reasonable.                Yes.     That's different than Mobile-Sierra, although Mobile-Sierra did invoke market forces of another kind -- of another kind.
08-678 +++$+++  
08-680 +++$+++ 
08-681 +++$+++               Are there other cases in which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing standard applies to appellate courts?                   It seems to me clear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual determination at the trial court level.
08-6925 +++$+++               How about pick pocketing, would pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a touching necessarily?              I guess a very good pick pocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not touch the person, I'm not sure.              It's really a question for Petitioner's counsel, and I didn't have time to ask as your white light goes on.         I take it your position is that if you do not prevail on your argument, that this is under Roman -- small Roman 1, that if -- you have to remand for small Roman 2?              Is there an argument that you anticipate objecting to that remand?               Or is this absolutely clear-cut that we must remand?
08-724 +++$+++              Well, if -- if the strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to some extent, Justice Scalia have outlined is a correct strategy, would you go on to say that the implementation of that strategy was substandard? It's rambling, you have to -- in order to get Mr. Cordray's very succinct explanation, you have to go through a couple of pages and drift it out, as Justice Sotomayor said, his argument was fine, and Justice Breyer -- but that is not the argument we have.             What -- what is the case that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme courts, where it is said that the implementation of the strategy was just inept -- totally inept. I mean, is that what your argument is here?             Again, that depends on, oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom. This -- this is very hard for us -- you know, he was trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously. These are things that are very difficult for us to assess.
08-728 +++$+++                 Just for my -- just for my information, what's a motion to -- to waive?          I mean, why does he need permission to waive?             I see.
08-7412 +++$+++              If we look just at deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference in life and life without -- life with parole and life without parole is just not a factor in deterrence.               I -- I don't know how I'd confirm that one way or the other, but let's -- let's assume that there is some basis for that intuition. Then, insofar as the deterrence prong is concerned, since it's not a deterrent, and if you assume that there is rehabilitation, what is the State's interest in keeping the accused, the  - the defendant in custody for the rest of his life if he has been rehabilitated and is no longer a real danger? What's the State's interest?             And you could say retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case basis deciding when there should be retribution.             But it seems to me the deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation.             Can you tell us just a little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the policies with respect to rehabilitation programs?             If they don't have parole, then you might say, well, they don't need rehabilitation programs or that they might need them more. Had the rehabilitation programs been increased or decreased since the phasing out of parole? Or is it about the same?       Or are they -- are they non-existent?
08-7621 +++$+++               That wouldn't apply to the Eighth Amendment?              We re talking about the first sentence of (B), I take it?             What age was he at that point?
08-769 +++$+++                 I have one more -- one more question along the lines of Justice Alito.                  Forget this statute.     Under a properly drawn statute, suppose that bull-fighting or pitbull-fighting is unlawful in every State.     Could a theater have a live broadcast of a pitbull fight in Japan and charge ten dollars?                  And let's add the hypothetical fact that a lot of the revenue goes back to Japan and promotes more bull-fighting.    Could a properly drawn statute prohibit that?   And then perhaps Justice Scalia, Alito, has a follow-up question on his own hypothetical.                  Could a properly drawn statute prohibit that, that speech?             We are asking whether or not that specific instance could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute, just like Justice Alito's hypothetical was under a properly drawn statute you could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that conduct.             So your answer to my hypothetical is yes it could be prohibited under a properly drawn statute?              Suppose an argument -- excuse me. Suppose an argument had been made to the Court in Ferber, that, you know, it's really good for people to see molestation of children because then they will be outraged and they will enforce the statute more. I just can't see the Court accepting that argument for a single -- for a minute.              But that's the argument you are making.              Well, it seems to me that we ought -- if there is a significant chance that Congress can affect an illegal market, an illegal activity by a statutory regulation we ought to defer to Congress on that ground.         I think you still have speech arguments.              On this economic causation, I think we have to defer to Congress largely.                 What was your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical about human sacrifice?
08-810 +++$+++          They have not had --         You re being careful not to not to say "bad faith."        There was no bad faith here?         I'm looking for -- I'm still not sure of the standard.         I'm the district judge, and I want to defer in -- in case A and not in case B. What -- what's the difference?
08-861 +++$+++              But that's -- that's the history and tradition of this board, which isn't very long.   But the history and tradition of boards like this is that their investigative powers are independent. Now, you say that there could be a rule, but that just isn't the way it works.      And if you refer us to history and tradition for other purposes, we ought to look at the operational principles, operational assumptions of this board.             I want to ask -- I want to ask one thing:   You want us to imply or find -- or you want us to infer from the statute that there's a power in the President to remove SEC commissioners for cause? You want us to find that that is implied in the statute?             All right.   What is -- what is the authority for us to find that there is an implication in the statute to remove just for cause? There s -- wouldn't that be unique in our precedents?             I mean, if there is a removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all purposes?   How -- why can it be limited to just for cause?   What authority do we have to do that?              But we are talking -- we are talking about independent or quasi-independent agencies, and I understood Solicitor General Kagan to say that it's quite all right with an independent agency for the President to phone them on an ongoing basis and say, do this, and do that. Do you agree that that's what a President ought to do with an independent agency?              Call them on a routine basis, to supervise what they are doing?              Well, they -- they -- this board has authority to -- to tax those people it regulates, to issue subpoenas, and so forth.               But this isn't subject to the operations of the President, if he has to go through an independent agency.       Are you encouraging the President, on an ongoing, daily basis, to instruct an independent agency what he wants done?             No, no, Humphrey's -- Humphrey's Executor was not a specific issue.                It was just the general qualifications.             I -- I --             I -- I understand that.
08-876 +++$+++               Well, it's a little -- it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an argument that shows a way the statute can be saved cannot be -- cannot be presented.              I mean, he's saying the statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this -- this construction.     And if you do, his -- his conviction must be set aside.              Well, on the other hand, if we just can't find a -- a grounding in the statute for it, then that's because the statute's there.             So if the employee would be fired if defalcation had come to light, that's material?                All right, that's the ball game.                Then that's the ball game. Hypo:   you go to the ball game, the government --                The employer finds out about it, he fires -- so it's material because you would be fired for it.                I'm asking about just materiality.     Just materiality would be satisfied.              You said that if the employer would fire, that is material. And then we had the ball game hypothetical.                Then you said oh, well, and then some other thing.                But we are talking just about materiality so you should stick with that question.              He drives to the ball game in the government -- in the company car.
08-88 +++$+++                But the Chief Justice's question, I'm interested in it as well, are there instances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay and have that not attributed to the State?                 Is it always attributed to the State --               Just because he's State --              There is a delay, but it's not attributable to the State.
08-905 +++$+++              Well, it does seem to me that even if we adopt your theory of the case, there is some problem with the allegation that there was fraud, because Vioxx did not -- because Merck did not disclose that the hypothesis was only hypothetical, and the FDA August letter made that clear.             So it seems to me you may have a problem as to that aspect of the case.             But, again, I'm not sure we would parse that out up here.             Oh, well, you mean we have to look to see how the analysts react?
08-911 +++$+++              But we are talking about what s  specified  under subchapter 2.              I think that's an important word, in addition to "under."              And motions to reopen are specified, and it doesn't say discretion.      It just says there shall be a motion to reopen. Do you get any mileage from that, or you seem to rest your argument instead on the regulations? And I think that's almost a weaker argument.             So you -- you consider -- you -- you think it's plausible to have a regime where motions to reopen are not discretionary at all, absent regulation?    That would seem very odd to me.                Do you think absent the special provisions of the -- of the immigration act that we are considering, if it were just under the APA, that a motion to reopen would be committed by law to agency discretion under 702?      Because it seems to me that, you know, there are sources we could look to, to see whether or not it's rationally exercised.             Well, I actually think it helps you because -- there is -- there is something to review, the agency does have discretion.            But this statute strips it, because it provides for motions to reopen, specifically.      But, of course, you --             -- you don't take that --              Now, what -- on what page? Look at page 6 --
08-9156 +++$+++               That -- that brings us to the point of beginning.       And could you give me, in summary form, your best interpretation of both (d) and (e), (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(1), in light of the deference that the Federal courts should pay to State determinations? It seems to me that, if you use -- if you reserve (e)(1) for cases in which there's a hearing in the District Court, then it's somewhat counterintuitive because the strongest standard applies to the accused. He has the greatest burden, when the State hearing was the least effective. On the other hand, if they overlap, there -- then (d)(2) is often superfluous, so I have a choice of something that is counterintuitive or superfluous, and I don't know which one to take.              And -- and -- but maybe there is -- is some more general theory that you can give me.              Res judicata doesn't work.              Although I think Congress might have had something like that in mind.               Well, I don't think they've been handling it.         I think there's a tremendous confusion, and I -- I find it very difficult to write an opinion to give them guidance as to when they can set aside hearings, to what extent they have to review the entire record. To me, I think many courts of appeals and district of -- and district courts think that it's just like a clearly erroneous standard.                It's very hard to -- to use these standards to give you any concrete guidance in this specific case.
08-964 +++$+++               Was the State Street case a machine-or-transformation test?              You talk about the State Street case in your brief, and it's complicated because of the Federal statute that followed it.            If you had just the facts of State Street before us, and forgetting the Federal statute was enacted after it, how would you decide this case?              That's what I thought. And is it -- is it machine or transformation, in your view?             Well, that was one of the reasons I asked you about it, I suppose.              Just looking at the whole case, do you think the State Street holding -- the State Street invention was patentable?              How would you come out in the State Street case today, if all of the arguments were made under your test?              That's -- that's a problem I have.             You thought we -- you thought we d mess it up.
08-969 +++$+++              Could you satisfy Justice Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by saying that if there were a corporation that went around to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and that would be closer to your case?             Well -- well, you're certainly consistent and persistent on that point.                But it -- it would seem to me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to differentiate this case.          And isn't that consistent with RICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?              So do you say then that proximate cause is in part established because of the specific intent?    Is that --              Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad you said that, because the Associated Contractors said specific intent is not --              But in -- in the world and in the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there proximate cause because this was the business model? How do I explain that in terms of proximate cause? There's not specific intent.              I know.        But there is no other -- take a case which was put to you as the seller who has many reasons for selling from out of State. They have a good catalog business, it's a well-established name, and so it's not just to avoid taxes.   How is that different from what happened here?              Okay, and in terms of proximate -- the universe of the law that we call proximate cause, how do you explain that?                   It's not specific intent.
08-970 +++$+++              Were -- were expert witness fees reimbursable in this case, under -- under the statute?     I noticed they were cut down, but I didn't know if he cut out all of them or just part of them.             All right.
08-974 +++$+++ 
08-992 +++$+++                 Insofar as the ongoing rule is concerned, let's assume that as of the time of Doctor, which was a Third Circuit case, 1996, the Pennsylvania rule was then clear, Pennsylvania for the first time having made its rule clear.                    Would it be improper to apply it to this defendant, because he escaped before Doctor made it clear?                     I -- I just don't understand why the general rules of -- of -- of waiver apply in this case.      It -- it doesn't affect rational conduct.   It doesn't trap an attorney.                   Why can't we take the rule as it was when we heard his case after he had been returned as a fugitive?              Do I -- Do I take it that -- that Justice -- Justice Breyer's question, repeated by Justice Scalia -- just take that fact, that's the only question before us.                      If it was discretionary and it's now mandatory, just focus on that only.              Then your client isn't hurt?   If you take --                 But all -- all those books on our wall are the first time it's ever come up.                      I mean, that's how the law -- that's how the law is made. So -- the whole point of the adequate independent State ground, it seems to me, is part we don't want to affect rational conduct retroactively --                  not applicable here. Two, we don't want to have the State court use this as a subterfuge or a device to avoid a Federal right.                      I don't think that's applicable here.                      You might want to argue about that. So it seems to me that the fact that it's a completely new rule in the case of an escape may mean it is still an adequate ground.             But those weren't escape cases.   Were they all escape cases?             Well, that's the point. Why isn't escape sui generis, and how can we ever say that?              Were you still answering the Chief Justice's -- I had -- had one more.              I didn't mean to interrupt. You said there was no post-conviction review.    I -- I thought they in this case went on to ask -- to exercise a limited review.                     They didn't reach the Mills v. Maryland point, but they did give a limited review to determine the sufficiency of the evidence, whether the death penalty was a product of passion or prejudice, whether the evidence fails to support the finding of the aggravating circumstance, whether the sentence was extensive or proportional.                    They did give post --              -- -conviction review on all those points.
08-998 +++$+++              Without the word "projected"?             Without the word "projected"?
09-10245 +++$+++        Well, here the agreement at various points says that the parties agree on the calculation of the guideline.     I think it's paragraph 11 and 12.     They say that the sentence is according to the guidelines.     So there's reference to the guidelines throughout, and the court made the guidelines calculation.       So it seems to me fair under the statute to say that it is based on the guidelines.       And there are other provisions in the agreement you might argue about.       Well, they do come up with a recommendation, which is three levels below the otherwise applicable guideline.       Yes, but that's all based on the guidelines.       But that doesn't mean that the court can't base its conclusion on his independent -- on its independent judgment on the guideline.       Well, you're talking about what "based on" means, and that's an important part of your argument.     If I could just, while I've got you, jump to this question of what happens on remand if you lose the case.     On remand, I take it, you're not bound by the agreement because of the last -       -- the last of section 24 says the defendant argues for any sentence other than the one to which he has agreed to and breached the agreement.       Would you -- what would that mean?       Well, it's got guilty pleas on all of the counts.     We know that.       In your position, in your view, would the government be able to take the position that the guilty pleas stay in place, but it now wants maximum?       Maximum guidelines.       Yes, except that the agreement does.     The agreement relieves you.       Of any obligation.     I see what you mean.       So you say the judgment's final, so the fact that the plea -- that there's a breach of the plea agreement is irrelevant at this point?
09-1036 +++$+++        In what percentage of the cases is there a representative?       And you say -- you say that 80 percent of the time there is a registered -       -- advocate or counsel?       Stone was somewhat mixed, though.     It was a motion for reconsideration of the agency, whether or not that tolled the time to go to the court; am I correct?       That's sort of a hybrid problem in the context of Justice Ginsburg's dichotomy.
09-10876 +++$+++        Well, let's say that this Court holds that the Confrontation Clause requires the presence of the actual analyst to testify about the sample.     Is there anything in the law that says that that testimony is suddenly excused, and you do not need the analyst if there's another sample available for the defendant to test?     That's not the rule, is it?       But I'm saying that analytically that does not bear on the question whether or not the sample that's introduced by the State requires the -- the analyst to be present.     They're just unrelated.       That may -- that may show that the confrontation rule is a silly rule.     But it doesn't -- but it -- there's -- assuming confrontation is required, it's not excused -       -- by the presence of another sample.
09-1088 +++$+++        All right.     And this goes back to Justice Scalia's question.     The question which we granted -- question 1 is whether the Federal court may reject a State court adjudication of a petitioner's claim as unreasonable based on a factual predicate for the claim that petitioner could have presented in the State court but did not.     And that describes what you're talking about in response to Justice Ginsburg. Now, the Petitioner, unaccountably, has told us a few minutes ago that this is a new claim, which I think changes the whole question.     But it seems to me the claim is whether there's ineffective assistance of counsel by reason of the mitigation evidence.     And in that case, we go back to Justice Scalia's opening question to you:     Was it the court relied on different evidence, evidence that was not in the State hearing? And that's the question, whether or not they can do that, if this evidence could have been presented. And certainly it could have been presented.
09-11121 +++$+++        But you say associated with a reasonable man, and when we construct the reasonable man, you're asking me to think of a 25-year-old sitting in a seventh grade social -- social studies class.       That's a little hard for me to imagine.       I'm sorry.     I just -- the only statements that could be suppressed -- I just didn't hear.
09-11311 +++$+++ 
09-11328 +++$+++        There is something ironic in your position that the defendant who lives in the circuit that is most clearly wrong is treated worst.
09-115 +++$+++        But underlying Justice Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do that?       But you are taking the mechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program that is optional, and you are making it mandatory.     It seems to me that's almost a classic example of a State doing something that is inconsistent with the Federal requirement.       Just so you know, I interpret your answer as confirming the implication of Justice Breyer's question, that there is a very substantial difference in Federal and State law on this point.     I mean, you've told about -- you know what lawsuits are about.     If you're -- if you're home free by a driver's license and Social Security inspection under Federal law and you're not under State law, that is a difference -
09-11556 +++$+++        Of course we know it's too loud.     It's always too loud.
09-1156 +++$+++        Well, I thought this might come up.     At some point, do we look at scienter and then go back from that to whether or not it's material, i.e., the argument would be the company knew that this would affect the price, and that's why they didn't disclose it, and therefore that shows it's material?     Or do we do this with two isolated boxes -- one, materiality; two, scienter -- and we don't mix the analyses?
09-1159 +++$+++ 
09-1163 +++$+++        Well, if the -- if the agency has a rule that says put explosive A in building and put explosive B in building 2, that's hard for me to explain that it's just a personnel rule, other than, as Justice Scalia says, everything -- all functions have to be undertaken by humans.       Well, what about my hypothetical?     Why -- why is that person -- primarily or solely personnel rule?       But that goes back to the point that -- I forgot about a computer age, but, forgetting that, humans have to do most things now.       Would you classify those as internal procedural rules -- personnel rules?     And would you also classify architectural specifications as internal personnel rules?       What about architectural specifications?
09-1205 +++$+++        Well, of course, you're arguing the principle.     What would have happened if the class had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class had gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West Virginia court had denied class certification?     Would that preclude a later Federal court from granting class certification?
09-1227 +++$+++        Your underlying premise is that the individual has no interest in whether or not the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was framed on that theory.
09-1233 +++$+++        They had a -- they had a cutoff date of some 2 months before the trial -       And that was a -- and - but before that point, the experts that were -- had testified were aware of the conditions that existed.       What about the argument that there was evidence that should have been admitted but that was not, with reference to new construction?       I have this question, and this goes just to remedy.       I recognize the district court has to be given considerable discretion. It shows the 137.5 figure because it's halfway between 145 and 130.       I think that certainly the Prison Litigation Reform Act means that you have to, if you -- if there's going to be a release order, it must be releasing the minimum amount -       -- that will effect the purposes of the remedy order.     There was substantial expert opinion that 145 -- 145 percent would be sufficient.     Isn't -- doesn't the evidence indicate to you that at least 145 ought to be the beginning point, not 137.5?       That there was no -- and I understand -       There were more -- correct me if I'm wrong -- there were more experts that testified that 145 would work than there were that 130 was necessary.       And -       But the experts -       The experts that -- who were testifying were quite aware of the fact that overcrowding related to the constitutional violations. That was their whole theory.       And any number of them suggested that 145 would be sufficient.       I see no evidence in the record that the State -- that the -- pardon me -- that your clients said that 145 wouldn't work.       I -- I don't see a finding by the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be an efficacious remedy.     I know that it -       I know that it would for 137.       If you take the State's concession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the Federal court order is 2 years, we're talking about 3 years.     Is there any indication of how fast the State's remedy would click in?     Are we talking maybe about a percent differential for the last 3 years, or -       No, no.     I'm saying, assuming -       Compare what the State concedes that it will do with what the court has ordered it to do.
09-1272 +++$+++        Well, I -- I think the Court is interested in taking the case on the question whether or not the police may create exigent circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to enter.     Now, whether or not there were exigent circumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it seems to me, a subsidiary question.
09-1273 +++$+++        Well, I -- I don't understand why what Justice Scalia said isn't the same as what you said.     You said no, Justice Scalia, Restatement of Contracts.     But what he said the question is whether or not did the parties intend -- and it's an objective intent -- to confer these rights on a third person.     And -- and you said no, no, that's not it.     But then it seems to me that your answer that you gave was just what Justice Scalia said.     I -- I missed something.
09-1279 +++$+++ 
09-1298 +++$+++        I have this -- this question about due process:     The components of the due process analysis, it seems to me, are what is reasonable, what's necessary in the case, what's unconscionable.     That it seems to me is just an extrapolation of what Reynolds said, and I don't know why we don't have that just as a law of -- of -- the Federal common law of contracts.     I don't know why we need to elevate this to a due process analysis.       Assuming that we're -- we apply Reynolds, which -       Well, that -       That just restates the question of what -- what do you do if you apply the Reynolds principle to this case, and they would say, well, you could have put it in your contract, too, and I think that's almost a wash.       We can -- we can do it as a member -- as a matter of the law of contracts.     And when we look at the law of contracts in Reynolds, Reynolds talked about the moving party, and I'm not -- I'm not sure that that phrase either had or has really definable content in our law.     It seems to me it's just a question of the burden of persuasion. At one point, the contractor has to proceed. He makes -- it makes a certain showing, and the government has to go back and forth.     And if at some point, the person with the burden of persuasion invokes the privilege, then we have to ask whether it's fundamentally fair as a matter of the Federal law of contracts.       Did the contract -       Did the contract contain the term "moving party"?       Well, in a whole law of contracts, you could say, oh, the contracting parties could have put this down, anticipatory breach, we don't need to have rules on that, that the parties could have negotiated that.     That's not the way the contract law works.
09-1343 +++$+++        Does your argument depend on whether the manufacturer is the manufacturer of the whole machine as opposed to a component part, like Asahi?     Suppose there was a little battery or lever that was manufactured, I don't know, in France, and it was sent over to this English manufacturer, and they were - this part is incorporated in many different kinds of machines, but the part then -- and then the facts are the same:     It goes to the Ohio distributor and New Jersey, but the part is what causes the injury. What results?       Well, it's like Justice Breyer's hypothetical.     He wants to sell to the entire universe if he can.       But -- but you were cut off before you finished your answer.     I want to make sure I understood it.     I -- I make the inference that you -- you would say that if there is an advertisement, not a sale, just an advertisement on the Internet, replacing the trade show, that that is a significant availment -- a purposeful availment, and there can be jurisdiction in New Jersey.     Same factors here - somebody who doesn't go to the U.S. trade shows, but he does put it on the Internet, the same result?       I want to know what your position is.       But was the sale here negotiated in -- or part of the sale negotiated in Nevada or the person just -- the New Jersey manufacturer just was interested in the machine and then later contacted the Ohio distributor?       No, I'm -- I'm trying to relate what happened here to the Internet hypothetical. I have the -       -- Internet hypothetical where there's just an advertisement.       And, at first, I thought you were saying that's sufficient.     Now you say no, because they have to be part of the contract.     I'm trying to make the Internet equivalent to the trade show.       Okay.     But not just an advertisement?       Even though that's the cause for the buyer's interest in it and he pursues - pursues his -- his transaction after finding out all the information on the Internet, but he phones the Ohio distributor?
09-1403 +++$+++ 
09-1454 +++$+++        Well, but Justice Alito's question was addressed to the Ninth Circuit.     In the Ninth Circuit, it's not going to come up again if we assume that our public employees are going to be law-abiding.     They're bound by this in the Ninth Circuit.       And you -- and you want them to be bound, and yet you say there's -- that the case is moot.     I just don't understand it.       But there's nothing in the record that indicates that you're withdrawing your Monell action against the municipality, is there?       But isn't it -- isn't a motion to reinstate it still pending in the district court?       All right, so it's still alive.     And -       -- there's nothing in the record to indicate that you won't ask that it be reinstated.
09-1476 +++$+++        Well, under -- under the First Amendment speech clause -       We have said that an employee's, public employee's, right to speech can be regulated, can be confined, can be restricted beyond what the State could do for a nonemployee.     Are you saying that if -- if the Petition Clause is involved there is no right to restrict what the -- employer does?       Then you have to offer a test and you don't want the public concern test, so what's your test?       And you would be content to apply that analytic, broad analytic framework to the Petition Clause?       In the Garcetti case, the district attorney was disciplined for sending a memo because he disagreed with how the trial strategy was supposed to unfold, and then he actually made that argument in court and was disciplined for that. Would he have been protected if he had just gone to court to sue the office of the district attorney on some sort of a prospective injunction saying, with reference to all search warrants you should follow the following procedures?     Would that have been protected, even though the memo was not?       Would you have objected if the same analysis were used in the Petition Clause case as in the actual case?     Just take the -       Just white out "Speech Clause" and put in "Petition Clause" and file the same opinion?       I want to know how the analytic framework differs.       Well, you're the expert in this area, but that -- that surprises me.     I thought it was quite common in the early 1800s for you to go to all your neighbors -- and the book "Quarreling About Slavery" explains this, where there were petitions signed by many of the constituents in the congressman's district.       And there were scores, scores of -- of signatures on these petitions.     So that's like your card table.       That was the Calhoun position, not the John Q. Adams position.
09-1498 +++$+++        And I can't stand the suspense.     I -- I would like to hear about the delay point.
09-150 +++$+++        I didn't hear the end.     In locating and?       Apprehending.       But I think you might have another -       Perhaps there is another answer that I would like to hear.       I thought -- I thought the rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable.     You can certainly question that.     But I thought that that was the rationale that the courts gave.       On your death bed before you're going to meet the maker, you're not going to lie -- I think that was the test.     So it was a reliability component, correct?       Now, suppose that there is a universe of instances that we can identify as questions in order to alleviate and stop an emergency to prevent a crime from becoming aggravated and continuous. Let's suppose we can have a universe of those questions.       Is -- is there an argument that responses made for that purpose are more reliable? Is that what -- is that what underlies the so-called emergency exception, do you think?       So it -- so -- well - and, of course, Davis certainly does not rest on reliability -- or Crawford, rather, doesn't rest on reliability.       But isn't that really the only way to explain the 911 exception?       Isn't there a reliability component that underlies this whether we like it or not?       But isn't -- isn't the reason we accept that is because it's reliable?     It's an excited utterance.     It's an account of an ongoing event. It's a contemporaneous observation.     Therefore, it is reliable.       But you -- you were the one that drew the line between a past event and an ongoing event.     Suppose the sniper says, I've shot you now, and I'm going to shoot three other students, good-bye.     That's a past event.
09-152 +++$+++        Under your view, when does the manufacturer have to come forward and acknowledge that there is a defect in the design?       But if the manufacturer is slow or remiss or negligent or willful in not giving the information to the Government, there is nothing the injured person can do.     There is still complete preemption, under your view?       The warning doesn't have to say, "Warning:     We could make something better if we wanted to." (Laughter.)       I'm still not clear -- I'm still not clear what answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg's question, saying:     Why didn't Congress put this out in plain words:     There should be no liability for design?     Is the answer sloppy drafting? Are you reluctant to give that answer?
09-1533 +++$+++ 
09-158 +++$+++                I think you are right, but MCCleskey was pre-AEDPA.               What was the answer under AEDPA to Justice Scalia's problem?             But we just found that to be successive under the words of the statute?                What -- what case do I read that supports that proposition?             I -- I had thought that law of the case issue preclusion would apply.             Well, the old -- the former rule of course, was that you could bring writ after writ after writ.                Was it -- was MCCleskey the first time that that -- that that was foreclosed? No.                That -- that just -- that just incorporated a whole body of law which was very much like issue preclusion, was it not?
09-223 +++$+++ 
09-291 +++$+++        So you're saying an employer could adopt that policy?       Are you saying an employer could adopt that policy?       -- that's proper or improper?       But the -- the persons - the two people in the hypothetical that are fired can't sue?
09-329 +++$+++        You talk about the plain meaning or -- I thought you agreed that the -- that the regulation is ambiguous.       I thought you did.
09-337 +++$+++                 When it's below them, you mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary company?             I have one -- one question about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture on it.     Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got this big award for  B.E.S.T. 4 ?             Pardon me.  I -- Your Honor -- clearly, as             How many -- if you have a ,000-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read?             But this is the first one.             The one I pointed out to you with the mistake, that s the first one.
09-338 +++$+++               And in that case, one of the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?             In -- in Arizona.
09-350 +++$+++        But then you're not really hurt if -- or the system isn't really hurt by the rule that the city asks for.     If it's so easy to establish a policy or custom requirement in cases where prospective relief is sought, then that's the answer.     You can establish it.     End of case.     But you don't get it unless you establish the custom and practice.       Well, I'm -- I'm not sure I understand your submission.     And it could be I'm just obtuse on this point. I interpret your remarks as saying that Monell does apply when there's an injunction.     Do I misinterpret you?       And you say, oh, it's so easy to do, it doesn't make any difference.     Well, then, why are we here?     Why isn't the city right?       But the Ninth Circuit didn't think so.       Did or did not?     The Ninth Circuit did not?       You agree with that statement, yes?
09-367 +++$+++                Well, I just want to make clear where we are.      Justice Breyer said, can the defendant appeal?     You said yes.             Suppose he said, must the defendant appeal?             Must?             Even though -- even though he says the restitution shall be held in abeyance pending receipt of information?              You attach no significance to the fact that in this case the judge said:               I shall order restitution?      It's the same as if he said nothing at all about restitution, so far as you are concerned?              I suppose that an answer to the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and -- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil -- civil liability, and they take their chances. But that -- that points up a difference between this case and Montalvo-Murillo.                 In this case, finality is central to the system, and that wasn't -- that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo.
09-400 +++$+++        Well, why isn't this just governed by the standard principles of tort for concurrent actors?     Actor A was not negligent; actor B was; they both contributed to the accident.     And we look to the Restatement of Torts, which is whether or not the wrongful actor made a significant contribution.     That's -- that's the end of it.       But we're -- but we're talking about the test.     And the test I gave you is quite different from the "cat's paw" test.     And if you use the test something along the lines that I formulated -- I don't know if that's precisely what the Restatement says -       -- but to that general effect, the instruction given to the jury was really overprotective of your client, under the standard concurrent -- concurrent causation analysis.
09-448 +++$+++              The government in response to questions about the significance and the consequences of its position said, oh, this is a unique statute. ERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute. Do you agree that if -- if we rule for you, it would be applicable primarily to ERISA and it wouldn't have an effect on these other statutes?
09-475 +++$+++              But isn't one of the reasons that they litigated the injunction was that by its terms and because of its issuance the agency on remand could not have adopted some partial measures to allow controlled planting?             But -- no, but isn't that -- isn't that the reason that the manufacturers, Monsanto, contested the injunction?                       They said -- because once the injunction is issued, as the government has told us today, they cannot issue some partial regulatory scheme with -- with safeguards.             But that -- but that is substantial.     It takes time, and the district court injunction that's now in effect prohibits that.                          And they have standing to challenge that.             Or at least that's their argument.              Yes.               In deciding irreparable harm, what weight if any should be given to the proposition that there was an environmental impact regulation violation, as opposed to just a regular suit between, say, two farmers over a nuisance?                  What weight do we give to the fact that -- let's assume -- there s a -- a violation of the rule requiring an environmental impact statement?             That is not alone a sufficient harm to justify an injunction, is it?
09-479 +++$+++  
09-497 +++$+++              After this --             After this suit was filed and both parties are going up the steps to the court, could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an arbitrator?     Could they do that?             No, then -- then the --             Then the employee loses. He says:    Oh, you have to have an open door; this was -- this was not properly before the arbitrator.             Because, you see, if you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the question is why can't they do it when the contract's signed?             Let's assume that the answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an arbitrator.    If that's so, how can you prevail in this case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of this issue to the arbitrator?             I'm -- I'm asking, assume you do?             But which is the stronger case for arbitration?       Case one, you attack the arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration contract only, as being unconscionable.                  Case two, you attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable.                  Do those both stand on the same footing, or is one a stronger case for submission to the court than the other?             I find that somewhat paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's the law.                So if you do go to the State court, suppose the State court says:                  I can't really decide this question about the one clause unless I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that. Do you have to wait and say:                  Stop, you can't do that?                But suppose the State court judge says that he has to look at the whole contract.   Do you say:        Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we have to go back to the arbitrator now?                What's your -- no, it's a hypothetical case.                What would your position be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?             And what do you think the judge should decide as between those two possibilities?
09-520 +++$+++        Well, it may be because the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely large that there's a much greater room for -- a much great danger of discrimination.     We know all States have property taxes.       Then you need to give us a test, and the test is whether or not the railroad is singled out as a target group for discrimination.       Something like that -- for discrimination, something like that.       What -- what authority do you have for the proposition that the clear statement rule applies to the exercise of the congressional power under the Commerce Clause?     Is that -       -- some general rule that we've always had?
09-5201 +++$+++              And each of those 4 years included 54 days of credit?             Well, they are just not vested until the year has -- the full year has passed.                Well, I -- I use it just in the calculating sense.               We -- if we disagree with that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think, suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?               Well, how do you explain the Granderson case?               The Granderson case.               I had thought that in that case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable.                     I know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either. That was a parole revocation case. But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the Rule of Lenity apply?       If the Rule of Lenity is thought of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that?                     It's a check against the power of the State, so that you simply mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the individual.   In a case like this, apply the Rule of Lenity.              Well, the Granderson case is cited in the brief for the National Association Of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies to this area and it seems to me that it ought to. I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal statute.   I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all the impact and force of the State detaining a person for a criminal act.             But the cumulated -             But what -- what we were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than Marbury versus Madison.
09-525 +++$+++        But there was -- there is nothing in the record to indicate that that statement was attributed to JCM.       You can -- you can play with the words "make" as you choose, but do we take the case on the assumption that you can show that it was attributed to JCM?     I -- I see nothing in -- in the record that would justify that.       You think attribution to the actor is not necessary for the actor's liability for a statement?       Your point is that -
09-529 +++$+++        Are there other areas - and I can't come up with the name of the case.     It was suggested by counsel, your friend, in the -- in his opening argument. I thought there were cases in which a subdivision is not -- a political subdivision of a State is not allowed to build a dam by State law, and yet it can go to the Federal Government, get a license, and build the dam anyway and just bypass the restrictions put upon its parent.     The agent has more powers than the principal gives it because it relies on Federal law.       In -- in this case, could Virginia sue VOPA in Federal court?       You think it could or could not?       Well, it would be the parent suing the -- the subsidiary, and -- and VOPA is not the State.
09-530 +++$+++        Well, I -- I have to agree with the implication of Justice Ginsburg's remark, at least what I imply from it. Look at the private employment sphere.     It seems to me that for a sensitive position, a bank who has people taking care of -- its employees taking care of other people's money, or the medical profession, that the employer could be sued and would be remiss if it did not ask this question. Do you know anything adverse about this person whom we're going to hire for a very sensitive position?       This is done all the time, and we do it with -- a judge said below, with our law clerks.       Question 42, do you have -- pardon me.     Question 7 on Form 42, the -- the standard one -- do you have any adverse information about this person's employment, residence, or activities concerning, and so forth -- a violation of the law?     Are you saying that private employers cannot ask that question?       The prospective private employer?       I -- I'm asking whether or not a private employer can ask third persons the question that's at Form 42 question 7.     I thought your representation to me was that private employers cannot ask that question.       But that was enjoined by the court below; was it not?       All right.       You said there are 22 people at JPL that are involved in the employment?
09-5327 +++$+++              And also, just in the course of your argument, how -- how often do these deadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA cases?     Do you have any statistics on that, or can you tell us from your experience?             I -- I -- I didn't hear. You say there has been discipline or there --             If we or -- this would probably be the Congress -- assuming some rule maker had probably be the Congress, assuming some rulemaker had authority to do this, would it make sense to say that the State is going to be subject to equitable tolling on a rather broad standard -- we re going to give equitable tolling often -- unless the State has attorney discipline procedures, so that this happens only once and then the attorney can no longer practice in the Federal courts?              Obviously, what we re looking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline, and if we re going to accommodate your friend on the other side, to have -- to have some rule about exceptional -- exceptional cases.
09-559 +++$+++              Was that pursuant to the Public Records Act that we re talking about --             -- or was that part of the initiative and referendum structure before the Public Records Act was passed?             So -- all right.        So this -- the public record -- pardon me.                The -- in California, we call it an initiative and referendum process -- existed and was in place before the Public Records Act added this additional feature of disclosure?             So there was a judgment at one time by the State of Washington that it didn't -- that it didn't need the public records disclosure?             What about a business boycott?             What about a business boycott?     Suppose that were a -- a likely outcome of disclosing the name?             This case will likely be controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because that's the most fully developed. Did you look at the Petition Clause at all? In the early days of the republic, the petitions were the way in which you communicated with your legislator.             And I tried to look it up. I have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those petitions were sometimes put in the Congressional Record.   But did you look at the history of the Petition Clause?               But, of course, that can cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a vote.   And there -- there is strong interest in keeping the -- the vote private.             Do -- do we take this case on the assumption -- do you make the contention before us that the Secretary of State and those who assist it are not capable of determining whether the petition signatures are valid?             I mean without public disclosure?
09-571 +++$+++        But at the -- but at the outset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to have a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train case.     You didn't mention that.       This is a failure-to-train case; is it not?       Well, I think that's very important.       And Miranda and proper supervision of affidavits in support of search warrants, and proper instructions that tell the police not to exceed the scope of the warrant.     So this is -- our course is expanding.       The -- the point of concern here is that we're going to have to go through a list, case by case, of everything there has to be training on.       Well, of course, there's a --       There is a causation problem here.     Even assuming training, if Deegan was going to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as he admitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lack of training is just irrelevant.       But I'm very concerned about that causation aspect.
09-5801 +++$+++ 
09-587 +++$+++        Well, of course, Johnson had given so many inconsistent statements at the outset that he was a weak prosecution witness.       It seems to me the defense could have pinned a great deal of hope on that.       But if -- if the expert says that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess it's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could not argue otherwise to the jury?       All right.     So, that's a reason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief Justice puts, in many cases prefers not to have experts, just so they can punch holes in the State's case. That's a -- that's a legitimate strategy.     And this counsel was very -- an adept cross-examiner.     There's no doubt about that.
09-60 +++$+++              Can you tell me what --             What would happen if there -- forget the State.         There are two Federal offenses. The first Federal offense is drug possession; the second Federal offense, drug possession, but the prosecutor is not quite sure that he has a strong case or she has a strong case for recidivism because of the first conviction. So the -- on the second go-around, the conviction is without the added finding of recidivism. What does the INA do with that case?             What -- what would --             If -- if I could just finish on this one -- this one.           In this hypothetical that we re discussing, the -- the two Federal offenses but no finding of recidivism, does the INA have the authority to question the first conviction because it was uncounseled or in effect collaterally question the first conviction?               No, what -- our hypothetical here is Federal.               Right.             What -- what case do I read to establish that?             Right.             Well, but Almendarez-Torres was a different offense; was it not? I mean this is -- this is a drug offender who -- it's not like a burglar who stops burglary to take up a new trade.    This is -- this is a drug offender who continues to repeat under the drug offense laws, and I thought the position was that this shows a particular propensity, a particular immoral attitude that s not being corrected. And so that the recidivism makes him a worse person.
09-6338 +++$+++              When the judge considers the adjustment motion under the -- under the section, does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison; i.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give the -- the reduction?             But he -- but he can t go below. The -- the Petitioner makes the argument metaphysically that there s just a new sentence.           In your view, is that refuted by the language of (c)(2) because they talk about in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then they say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the words "a new sentence shall be imposed"?           I assume that s your argument.             So, it's a one-way ratchet?                The Petitioner's brief opens with a statement about his rehabilitation.                We don't know if that has been contested.              You don't respond to it.   But let's assume that's all true.              He established schools, and he helped young people and so forth. Does the Justice Department ever make recommendations that prisoners like this have their sentence commuted?                And isn't the population of prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?                I think it is.   And were there -- how many commutations last year?                 None.   How many commutations the year before?              Five. Does this show that something is not working in the system?     185,000 prisoners?              I think that s the number.
09-658 +++$+++ 
09-6822 +++$+++        Well, but there are two explanations for your hypothetical.     One is there has been a real change that affects the judge. The other is where you -- where you began, I thought you were going, where the judge is evading the court of appeals.     Those are two different things.     I mean, one may happen, and one may not.
09-737 +++$+++        Except that it begins, 2(a), "Although courts normally do not review the denial of a summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity is an exception to this rule."     And that's -       That's the opening.     That sets the stage for what follows.       Now, it may be that everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended the rule because there are some cases that depend on an assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but that's not what the Sixth Circuit said.       I suppose there are some cases in which the failure of the court to give a requested instruction preserves the issue, and perhaps 50(b) is not required there. Were there any instructions proffered and denied in this case that would have preserved the issue for appeal?       One -- one way to make the formulation work is to say whether or not the issue depends on an assessment of the record.       Well, but we've been through this.     I think it was Justice Alito who gave the hypothetical -- suppose that everybody agrees on what happened; the question is whether or not the right's clearly established.       That's a pure issue of law.       I didn't hear your -- your last -- are adequately preserved when?       So you're saying that if there's anything in the record of the trial that indicates that the judge ruled on the issue, there need not be a 50(b) motion?
09-751 +++$+++        But that simply --       That simply points out that all of us in a pluralistic society have components to our identity; we're Republicans or Democrats, we're Christians or atheists, we're single or married, we're old or young.     Any one of those things you could turn into a public issue and follow a particular person around, making that person the target of your comments, and, in your view, because this gives you maximum publicity, the more innocent, the more removed the person is, the greater the impact -- the Justice Alito hypothetical in -- in the grandmother case. So I -- I think -- I think your -- your public concern issue may -- may not be a limiting factor in cases where there is an outrageous conduct and where there should be a tort.       But your position is that you can take this and you can follow any citizen around at any point?     That -- that was the thrust of the questions from Justice Kagan.       And -- and Justice Alito, and it seems to me that there -- you should help us in finding some line there.       But in the -- but the hypotheticals point out that there can be an intentional infliction of emotional distress action for certain harassing conduct.       But torts and crimes are committed with words all the time.
09-804 +++$+++        Well, that seems to me like just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you must recover under the plan, because if reliance is not required then there must be some basis on which you must recover, and that recovery must be under the plan.     So it's -- it's -       I mean, if you say -- if you say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see how the SPD can give you recovery, unless the SPD is the plan, which brings us right back to the argument, which is your argument, under the first -- under the first section, under (a) -       -- (a)(1), (a)(1).       So there's a -- there's a presumption that everything in the plan is favorable?     I still don't see how you get it both ways.     If it -- if it understates the benefits, that doesn't count?       So you say under standard trust law once you show there's a breach, the burden shifts to the trustee to show that there's no harm?       I mean, I understand that to be the Second Circuit rule, but I didn't understand that to be the rule generally in the law of trusts, and I quarrel with the Government's brief on that.     I think the Government's brief is quite wrong to suggest that this is part of the law of trusts.       Now, it could be the law of ERISA under the Second Circuit, but that's something quite different.       But that's not under trust -- trust law, or correct me if I'm wrong.       Under your proposal, I assume, if you prevail, under your position, the -- the summaries will now become part of the plan.     So that even if there's no intent to mislead, there can be a class action if the -- if the SPD is in anyhow at variance with the plan -       -- and to the -- to the detriment of the employee.       The minute you get away from contract -       Well, if it's a contract case as you're submitting, then the burden-shifting rules, it seems to me, that apply in trusts don't apply.       Well, and in all of that -       -- I think, under trust law, there has to be a showing of breach and harm before there is -- the burden shifts on causation.     And your brief left out the -- you indicate the burden shifts just so long as you show that there is a misstatement.
09-834 +++$+++        It's more of a question for the Petitioner's counsel than you, but are you aware of any cases in any other jurisdictions where there have been proceedings, actions for retaliation, based on complaints to third parties, like complaining to the press?
09-837 +++$+++  
09-846 +++$+++        Isn't it well established that part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when it requires an accounting is to give damages for breach of the trustee's duty?     That's Hornbook.       No, I'm talking about historically in equity.     No.     Historically in equity the trustee who breaches the trustee's duty in the equity court is required to give damages.       It's not common law, it's not common law, it's equity.     It's old law, it's equity.       What about this -       When you are in the CFC, don't you get -- you aren't you asking for compensation for losses and injuries from the commingling or the misappropriation of assets?       But your brief makes the -- seems to make the point that that's all just interest on capital.     It's not for lost capital.     But even as you described it, it sounds to me that you get damages for loss of capital plus interest.       My problem is that I read the CFC complaint as including both.     I will take a look at it.     And I intruded on Justice Breyer's question.       But in your case -- now, let's assume the government prevails.     You go to the CFC, and you prevail on everything.     You get all the findings in your favor and so forth.     There is some relief that you don't get. I take it, unless I am missing something, that you could then, after the CFC suit is finished, go to district court and say:     Now we want this added protection, this added relief.       And the statute wouldn't have run generally, because if you are seeking the injunction, it's only latches bars you, and you are not barred by latches because you couldn't have gone sooner.
09-868 +++$+++        So after a conviction in the State, if there's an appeal with a number -- on direct review, with a number of issues, improperly admitted evidence and so forth, you -- the lawyer can't add:     And, in addition, he was sentenced under the wrong provision; he was given 5 years too many because the judge cited the wrong provision.     You can't say that on direct review?       Is there a citation for that, that you have?     Is it your -
09-893 +++$+++        Suppose that this doesn't have what's called a blowout clause.     Suppose that that kind of clause was not in there.     And the consumer opts out of the arbitration.     Arbitration doesn't -- doesn't go well.     Anyway, can the consumer then insist on the arbitration that the consumer bargained for, the individual arbitration that the consumer bargained for?       So then the bank has to have -- liability exposure for two different proceedings?       But you are saying then California can say it's unconscionable to allow the parties to agree that there will be just the single arbitration proceedings?     I don't see how the third parties are necessarily protected.     If you say that the consumer still has the election, that certainly isn't what they bargained for.     Maybe I'm -- maybe that's just a quarrel with the content of the unconscionability standard.       Rather than FAA, but I think it does bear on at least section 4 of the FAA.       If you stick with the theory that the test is whether or not the law in question is inconsistent with the idea of arbitration - whose idea of arbitration?     What about, suppose it's the bank's idea of arbitration, that we -- we want this settlement, say; we do not want that; that's the bank's idea of arbitration that the parties agreed on.

Well -- well, that doesn't quite give us the added formulation that some of the questions suggest we need, if we're going to adhere to Dotson and still rule for you.     There has to be some slightly different qualification.     I'm not quite sure what it is.       I -- I was going to ask if you have a few moments to address the Rooker argument. What -- what is your response to the Petitioner's counsel's explanation of why there is no Rooker here?       But -- if I can have just 1 minute.     Then if you do not file an article -- in a State court at all and you just go to 1983, you're back under Heck, and you haven't given us a qualification that works under Heck.
09-907 +++$+++        What we are talking about is a paradigm of someone -- we're comparing someone who has a $470-a-month car payment and he gets -- and he gets the deduction.     Why is that, in light of the second sentence -- let's see, the third sentence of the statute, which says, "Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts."     I mean, that would be the car company. And has -- has that point been litigated?       No -- no, but it would -       It would eliminate the anomaly that -- one of the principal anomalies.     There are many anomalies in each position.     It would eliminate one of the principal asymmetries that seems to concern the counsel and the Court.       That it?       Well, I -- excuse me, Chief Justice.       No, but the -- but the gravamen of Justice Scalia's question is:     Why are you running away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel relied on?     And if that were clearly relevant to this statute, it would seem to me to answer the question. Are you saying we -- we don't look at this because it's just simply an interpretation; it's not a regulation?     What is -- what is -- in your view, what effect do we give to this language that Justice Scalia quoted?     Nothing at all?       Suppose we -- suppose we think the word "applicable" is ambiguous and difficult to construe.     Do we then look at this language at 1a, or do you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all respects?
09-958 +++$+++        So, what is the best authority in our cases, other than Ex parte Young, or in a treatise or in recognized statements of the difference in law and equity for the proposition that in this area we can make a distinction between law and equity after centuries in which we've tried to say that that distinction ought to be blurred?       I mean, do you want us -- would you want us to write an opinion and say, oh, there's a difference in damages at equity?       What do I -- other than Ex parte Young, what do I cite for that?       I know, but see --       But that -- but that wouldn't explain the case like Gonzaga where there was no State entity.     Gonzaga was a private institution.       So, I'm -- I'm wondering. I understand the Eleventh Amendment dynamic, which --       -- as Justice Scalia points out, was the whole driving force of -- of Ex parte Young.     Is there -- is there any other basis for us to say that there has to be a law/equity distinction? You say, well, that's because there is no adequate remedy at law.     But that's circular; that assumes because there's no cause of action -- so, that doesn't work.       The Supremacy Clause says that judges in every State shall be bound thereby, but if you want to amend it so that judges in every State and all administrators should be bound thereby, then you have a Supremacy Clause action against every Federal agency.     That doesn't make sense.       Number one, it doesn't say that.     There's no -- it doesn't say "all circumstances." It doesn't say that.       I'm -- well, no.     Justice Scalia's question was related to a Federal agency.     The Federal agency does something that's inconsistent with the statute, arguably, and you say there's a Supremacy Clause violation?     That's novel.
09-987 +++$+++        I'll -- I'll give you credit, Mr. Bender.     In your brief, you say if you're wrong on that point, that you're folding your tent and leaving.     There's -- that there's no standing and that there's no -- no violation.     But I must say, I have some difficulty that any money that the government doesn't take from me is still the government's money.       But that's the whole theory of your case.
09-993 +++$+++        Does the -- does the -       What is your -- what is your explanation for why Buckman isn't applicable here?       Well, the suit was brought by the injured person in Buckman.       And it's similar in that respect.     And in Buckman there was a -- a formal relationship which did not permit the cause of action, and it seems to me you could at least argue that a fortiori there should be no cause of action when there an informal relationship.
09-996 +++$+++ 
10-10 +++$+++        Is it correct for me to think of both the Petitioner's argument and your response as a Mathews v. Eldridge problem?       Well, it -- it does seem that absolute right and Mathews v. Eldridge is not quite a -- a good fit, but it seems to me that most of Mr. Waxman's argument can be subsumed within the Mathews v. Eldridge framework.       But just -- just assume that we could somehow block out that category.     If you could focus just on the domestic relations support proceedings, would there be a basic change in the way those proceedings are being conducted in other States, if we ruled in favor of Petitioner and said there's an absolute right?       Yes, and I -- and I suppose you could say that in -- in advance that the judge and the appointing authority simply wouldn't know.       It's a little difficult to write the opinion, if you are to prevail, saying there's no absolute right, but there might be in some other case, depending.     We don't give much help to the system that way, because it might be that ultimately we would find that the balancing test is more complex than simply appointing the counsel.       Well, then you do think we should lay out the factors?     And, if so, what are the factors?       Well, I -- I just don't know that all those things are properly before us.
10-1001 +++$+++        But those -- those were --       -- cases in which you could not raise -- pardon me -- in which you could raise the particular issue at hand.     But that's not this case.       The question is whether or not the rationale of those cases, which you state correctly, is applicable to a different set of circumstances.       But -- but those were, correct me if I'm wrong, cases -- those were not cases in which the issue could only be raised on collateral.       Well, Justice Kagan's question indicates that there are States, as you know, where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary hearing on IAC.     And as I understand your answer, is if that happens, the proceedings that precede the resolution of the issue on direct appeal, being probably conducted by the same counsel who is taking the direct appeal, can be conducted and he can be -- and the counsel, he or she, can be inadequate in the conduct of those further inquiries.     That seems to me very strange.       You're suggesting that there's no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on direct, when he conducts some supplementary proceedings.     That's very strange.       Well, not if you adopt the -- the one-proceeding rule that I think counsel for the Petitioner was suggesting.     He suggested Arizona is one of those few States where you could only raise this issue on collateral, and, therefore, you are entitled to effective assistance of counsel on that collateral. Then he would stop there, for statistical and for -- reasons, probability reasons, rather.

CARDOZO common law presume damages from the nature of the violation.    That is what was carved out, the ability to 3     presume it, rather than present evidence and subject it 4     to proof.      In -- in your argument, do 22     you have to avoid the concession that the term might be 23     ambiguous?

10-1121 +++$+++        It -- it seems to me that this answer is -- is so confusing that the Court probably should consider whether or not an opt-in requirement is -- is preferable.     I -- we're talking -- in the first exchange, you had with Justice Alito, he gave you a very simple question:     90 percent and 10 percent.     Then, it's reversed.     Special assessment for 90 percent political.     And the point there was that you're taking someone's money contrary to that person's conscience.     And that's what the First Amendment stands against.     And you simply wouldn't answer that question. You would -- and then you say, well, maybe that it's -- it's fungible, it's hard to --       It seems to me that you're avoiding --       -- a very, very critical question on the constitutional rights of these objecting members.       Let me ask you this --       -- by way of background In collective bargaining negotiations, do the unions consider the -- as one factor the importance of ensuring that the governmental employer has fiscal stability?       Well, isn't that ultimately a political judgment, so that even collective bargaining involves a core political judgment?       But you -- you concede, in ordinary collective bargaining, there are critical and important political -- significant political judgments that are being made by the union in the course of collective bargaining with chargeable expenses?
10-114 +++$+++        Well, I'm -- I'm not familiar with Louisiana standards of pleading. Afforded -- under 16 at page 41, the rights, privileges and immunities afforded Petitioner by our Constitution, Federal, and laws, State and Federal.       It would seem to me reading the complaint would permit that.       I -- I don't know what degree of specificity is required.
10-1150 +++$+++       We're talking about 22     summary judgment.    It seems to me, rough rule, that 23     summary judgment would be much more -- much easier under 24     101 than 102 and 103.      Why couldn't someone come up with the idea that at a level which is in the range 2     that's within your patent, if at a certain level for a 3     certain -- a person of a certain age, you administer a 4     new drug, you have a new result?    Why isn't that like 5     the fax machine?      But the --      -- Petitioner is saying 13     that if you think about that, it's an infringement. 14                 MR. BRESS vulcanizing rubber, which Firestone patented many, many 18     years ago, that involved you heat India rubber to a high 19     temperature, you add sulfur and mineral salts, and that 20     way you cure rubber into a usable way of using it. 21                 Now, many years later in Diehr, this Court 22     looked at a -- an improved process, if you will, for 23     making rubber which -- which involved continuous 24     measurement and the use of the Arrhenius equation to 25     know when the rubber was cured.    Now, there's no doubt that if somebody came out with a second one 10 years 2     after Firestone had gotten the patent on -- on 3     vulcanization, they would have had to pay patent 4     royalties for 10 years before their second one would 5     have been free of patent royalties, right, because they 6     would have had to respect the patent that Firestone got. 7                 So, the simple fact, in other words, that 8     there may be further improvements to what you've done 9     isn't where the Court has ever drawn the line.    And I do think that in conceptualizing where to draw these 11     lines -- because at the edges they're indeterminate, 12     they're elusive, and you're going to be somewhat arbitrary.    This is judge-made law.    I think that what 14     you've got to look to is what you've done before. And if we take this case in the spectrum of 16     what this Court has looked at, where you've got Morse on 17     one side, on that same side you've got Benson, which was 18     simply a formula for converting binary coded decimals to 19     pure binary, which the Court said you could use for an 20     infinite number of uses.    It was way too broad. If you look at Bilski, a general way of -- a 22     general -- the concept of hedging.    Now, Bilski was 23     limited, admittedly, and this Court discussed it and 24     said, well, they've tried to limit it with the conventional step of having the inputs determined by random analysis techniques.    I'd like to focus on that 2     for a second, because the Court said that was not 3     significant extra solution activity.    It wasn't enough 4     to either render the process a physical one in the world 5     or to narrow its scope.    Well, why is that?    Because 6     random analysis techniques are themselves just an abstract idea.    So, you were adding one abstract idea to 8     another one, and it's no wonder the Court found that it 9     didn't narrow it to a patentable scope. Now, on the other side of the line, we've 11     cases Tilghman.    Now, if you look at Tilghman, Tilghman 12     was a patent on the fact that if you use water at a high 13     heat and high pressure, you can separate out from fat 14     bodies the fatty acids, on the one hand, and the glycerin, on the other.    And this Court approved a -- a 16     patent process on that.    Now, that's of course a natural 17     law, Justice Alito, no question about it, in terms of is 18     it a law of nature that makes you do that?    Yes. But the Court was comforted in that case by 20     the fact that the patent wasn't trying to generally 21     patent -- monopolize the idea that water at high 22     pressure and temperature is going to in general break 23     bonds of chemicals.    And it wasn't trying to either 24     monopolize the whole idea of how you can separate fat 25     acids and glycerin from fat bodies.    There are other ways, including the use of sulfuric acid. Let's place this case in the continuum. 3     Now, we're not trying to patent the general broad idea 4     that you can use metabolite readings after you've administered a drug to determine what the likely -- what 6     the best level of the next administration might be. 7     That would be kind of like the Morse patent, and that's 8     not what we're doing.    What we're talking about here is 9     (a) a very specific class of drugs, the thiopurines, used for --

I give substantial deference?     This was all discussed -- page 9 of your brief, you summarized what the majority opinion of the en banc court did.       And in that connection, on this same line, do you -- do you agree with that summary?       Well, in line with Justice Breyer's question, can you give us an example of some other agency review proceeding that is somewhat like this, or is this just unique?       And you agree with that?       I -- I noticed that.
10-1259 +++$+++        We don't need to get into it, but "Live Free or Die" was spelled on the license plate. (Laughter.)       Why does it have to be cost-free?     Suppose the police department says:     We've got two things; we can put 30 deputies on this route and watch this person, or we can have a device with a warrant.     What difference does it make?       But suppose what they got is nothing more than what they would have had if they had 30 deputies staked out along the route.     That's all. They'd get the same from 30 deputies.     A constitutional violation?       Well, no.     We're assuming that there's no initial trespass, which is a problem in this case.       You're saying it's -- it's the quantity and -- of the information seized and the time over which it's seized.     And that's the proposition we're testing.     And it seems to me what you're saying is that the police have to use the most inefficient methods.       I'm fully aware of the 1984 ministry of love, ministry of -- of peace problem. But this -- your argument, it seems to me, has no principled distinction from the case that I put.       But you're --       You're mixing -- you're mixing two things.     You're the one that -- I thought your position was that the initial trespass is not important.     That's the narrow way to decide the issue. You don't want us to do that.     So, now we ask you about Karo, and you say, oh, well, there was a trespass.     So, that's -- that's not -- that's not a responsive answer.       Lots of communities have, including Washington, cameras on -- at intersections on stop lights.     Suppose the police suspected someone of criminal activity, and they had a computer capacity to take pictures of all the intersections that he drove through at different times of day, and they checked his movements and his routes for 5 days.     Would that be lawful?       You think it would be?       You have -- you have a targeted invasion.     It's over a period of time.     It's over a long -- it's over a wide space, and it seems to me that -- it seems to me you have to answer my question "yes" to be consistent with what you've said earlier.

We will just expect it as a matter of course, if you prevail.     Isn't that the necessary consequence of this case?       Well, I mean, even you did in this one.     You said now remember you're on television, which was just, you know, giving an added incentive for these vulgar comments.       But, I mean, isn't it inevitable that this will happen?       By "sanctioned," you mean punished as -- as opposed to "blessed" sanctioned?       Well, we -- well, we have to anticipate what the natural results or consequences of our decision will be.       As I understand it, the same rules that we apply to obscenity for printed material, under your view, would apply to television.

10-1399 +++$+++        Well, then we're back -- we're back to (b) overrides (a).     You -- you're saying that (a) would be interpreted in favor of the Petitioner but for (b)?       Because I agree with the Chief Justice.     Without an award, it seems to me it tends to help the Petitioner.
10-1472 +++$+++ 
10-1491 +++$+++        Can you tell me why --       Can you tell me why you think they did that?     I mean, for us, the -- respondeat superior is so simple.     Why isnt it a big deal in international law?       Well --       -- I wonder if you don't concede away too much when you say, well, there's a difference in substance and -- and remedy and questions of jury trial, damages, and so forth.     That's domestic. Those were the concerns that the U.K. and the Netherlands addressed in their brief as saying why corporations shouldn't be liable for acts committed on foreign -- foreign territories.     Those -- that was the whole reasoning of -- of the U.K. brief.
10-1542 +++$+++        What would --       Mr. Kinnaird, what would happen if the child remains with the grandparents in Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6 years until they can afford to take him.     Is the parents' residence then imputed to the child so that when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to have been there for 6 years?       Mr. Kinnaird, I'm having trouble figuring out, is your view that non-imputation is just unreasonable per se, or is your view that they didn't explain non-imputation properly?       Is -- is there some advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for early lawful permanent residence?     Because under your view, parents wouldn't have to bother to apply for it at all.     I'm -- I'm wondering about the --       -- the consequences of deciding in your favor.     And the other one, quite distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would not be some floodgate of -- of imputed residence cases.       Right.
10-174 +++$+++        We can concede that, but we still have the displacement argument -
10-179 +++$+++        Excuse me, I just couldn't hear.     On what grounds did he reverse himself, do you think?       Is -- is?
10-188 +++$+++        But that's the way the Second Circuit defined its own, or limited its own definition.     But why isn't it -- why isn't the Ninth Circuit incorrect -- pardon me, the Second Circuit incorrect when it says that this is not a governmental end?     It is a governmental end.
10-209 +++$+++        What -- what is the judge supposed to do?     Let's say the remedy is it goes back before the judge.     We're trying to unwind the clock or whatever the metaphor is.     Does the judge have to prescind all knowledge of what he learned in the trial?       Well, I'm asking what -- I'm a conscientious decisionmaker, and I'm asking for your advice on what I should do.       I know the details of this crime, which were more horrific than I would have expected, because I've heard them at the trial.     Do I just somehow forget about that, prescind that?       So, the answer is "yes." I -- I ignore everything that I learned during the trial.       Well, you say that.     But, as an administrative matter, I think we have to have some concern that these plea negotiations and discussions are in myriad circumstances.     The defense attorney is by the water cooler; the prosecutor walks by and says I'm thinking of offering you a good bargain in the Jones case.     He knows he's going to have that prosecutor in court the next day and really beat him. He thinks he's going to soften him up.     So, he doesn't communicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later says withdrawn. We're going to have inquiries post hoc on all of these negotiations and discussions.     And it seems to me that, absent some other rule, which I don't think we have the authority to impose, that all plea offers must be in writing and be stated with specificity, that if -- what you're proposing is simply unworkable.       I think you can --       -- answer the Chief Justice's question.     The Chief Justice said how are you going to know -- you have to show prejudice.       How are you going to know that he would have?     Of course, he's always going to say he that would have, but how is the trial judge going to make a credibility determination on that -- on that issue?     I guess it's just a credibility determination. I don't know how he's going to do it.     I think you can answer the Chief Justice's question yes or no.       Right.       Right.       You're saying it was unfair to have a fair trial?       You're saying it's unfair to have a fair trial; isn't that correct?       That has to be your position.
10-218 +++$+++       But as -- but as the Chief 8     Justice is indicating, I think, this concerns who owns 9     the bed; and that's different from navigable waters of the United States. And some of the answers you gave to Justice Alito about -- that the purposes and the reasons 13     for navigable waters of the United States are quite 14     different, really, than for the considerations we have 15     about riparian ownership.    Navigable waters of the 16     United States can be controlled by the United States for 17     many purposes, but that is concurrent with a separate 18     document -- doctrine for underlying ownership of the 19     bed.      And it's not clear to me 22     that the test for navigable waters is the same in each 23     case as to the whole river.      Would you help me with this?    Navigable waters of the United States for 2     purposes of Federal jurisdiction over many activities 3     such as boating is one concept.    Navigable waters of the 4     United States for purposes of State ownership of the bed 5     serves different purposes.      And -- and if there is a 15     difference, can you tell me a case?    And I think 16     Justice Scalia basically was asking this earlier. 17                 MR. GARRE      Yes.      But it is conceded, is it 21     not, that -- if we rule for the power companies in this 22     case, there still may be a situation in which these 23     waters can be navigable waters of the United States for 24     other purposes, other than ownership of the bed?    Or am 25     I wrong on that?      Did he write that during 6     his 30-day -- 32-day portage? 7                 (Laughter.)
10-224 +++$+++ 
10-235 +++$+++        Do you think that the phrase in the statute "in whole or in part" allows juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?       Why -- why not?       You're in the jury room and a juror says:     This wouldn't have happened but for the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be liability.     What -- and assume the jury has all of the Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read. What -- what is there for another juror to say that this is wrong?       Well, at -- at -- at least that, it seems to me, is a jury question.       But -- but -- but it was not instructed on foreseeability?
10-238 +++$+++        Do you think that one reason for people to decline participation in the program is because they do not want to deter independent expenditures?     And let me -- we'll talk about independent expenditures for just a few minutes if you don't mind.     You indicated independent expenditure has gone up.     I thought there was some data in the record that showed the population has gone up and so there's an argument about that.     But just as a common sense matter, if I'm someone with the capacity and the will to make an independent expenditure, why don't I think twice if this is going to generate an equal amount on the other side, which might be better spent.     Sometimes an independent expenditure is not really that effective, it's in a bad market, it's a bad message.     But this results in cash to the participating candidate, who then can use it in the most effective way.       All of which is designed to probe this idea that this somehow does not deter independent expenditures.     I frankly am tempted to believe the opposite view, so you can tell me about that.       Are you saying that anything that has to be disclosed can also be prohibited?     I mean, I just don't see the equivalence here.       It seems to me that this law has a severe criticisms leveled at it, severe legal invalidities alleged, quite without reference to disclosure.       Well, in your hypothetical of the -- of -- of a participating candidate who spends up to the limit, what happens if independent expenditures are then made on his behalf?       No, no.       There's -- there's - there's two participants -- there's two candidates, one who's a participating and one who's not.     The participating candidate spends up to his limit, he can't spend any more money.     But then he gets a lot of additional support from independent groups, correct?       I mean, that could -- that could happen?       But the -- but the point that you made that the participating candidate is limited leaves out the fact that there can be additional expenditures on his behalf by independent groups?
10-277 +++$+++        It's not clear to me What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?       It's -- it's hard for me to see that the -- your complaint faces in two directions.     Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that's going on.     Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there's an inconsistency there, and I'm just not sure what the unlawful policy is.       Well, is that disparate treatment?       Well, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought the Teamsters case was an action by the government that wasn't a class action case.       Pattern or practice, that's correct. Help me, if you can, with this.     Let's - let's suppose that experts' testimony, sociologists and so forth, establish that in industry generally and in retail industry generally, women still are discriminated against by a mathematical factor of X.     You have a company that has a very specific policy against discrimination, and you look at their -- the way their employees are treatment -- are treated, and you find a disparity by that same mathematical factor X, does that give you a cause of action?       The -- the -- the disparity with -- that women are subjected to are the same in the company as they are -       -- society wide, but the company does have a policy against discrimination.       Would that be true even if you could not show deliberate indifference?       Where there's no deliberate indifference and a specific policy prohibiting the discrimination, can you still proceed?       Well, if it's standardless and -- and recordless, then why is there commonality? It seems to me that what you -- your answer that you just gave really is a -- shows a flaw in your case on commonality.
10-290 +++$+++        Well, there are case - there are cases in which the presumption disappears?       Yes.     Well, I mean, there -- there -- there are instances in which a presumption disappears and then the -- the parties begin again with burden of persuasion, et cetera.
10-313 +++$+++ 
10-382 +++$+++        What's your best case that you have on that in the private trustee context?     I had thought your answer was going to be that in that case, the fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of the trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds might be dispositive and might give him the privilege. But you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions from the Court, that, other than this distinction you make between what the personal liability is and how he ought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky distinction, that the documents have to be disclosed. What's your best case for that?       Which means you can't get preventative advice, which is one of the most important kinds of advice an attorney can give.       But it also has broader authority, and that's just their point, I take it, for many other areas.     The sovereign can't easily divest itself of its responsibilities.     A trustee can so conform and shape its business that it doesn't have conflicts.     A government just can't do that.       Is this true regardless of the fact that the government may have a very powerful interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would become watered down?
10-444 +++$+++        Well, suppose the case in which a plea offer's made, not communicated, and expires.     Then there's a guilty plea hearing.     And he doesn't -- and the defendant enters a -- a guilty plea but doesn't know about the prior offer.     Is -- is there injury?       No, is the plea involuntary?     Is it -- pardon me.     Is it unknowing?       And what would he -- what would he have done had he known?       Well, you know, Judge, I'm really sorry I didn't accept responsibility 3 months earlier.
10-507 +++$+++        Does -- do we owe -- do the courts give some deference to the director's position?       Is it 30 percent of his time over his career or that month or in a year?
10-5258 +++$+++ 
10-5400 +++$+++        Suppose -- suppose the case in which the judge is going to sentence to 2 years no matter, but there is a 2-year rehabilitation program, and the defendant is -- the prisoner is receiving that. Would you say that, at that point, the prisoner is receiving an imprisonment term and rehabilitation?       Hypothetical.     The term isn't affected by the program, but the judge recommends the program, and the prisoner is receiving it.       Would you agree the prisoner is then receiving both an imprisonment term and rehabilitation?       I -- so then, we can use those two goals of sentencing in -- in the conjunctive -       -- and you can have imprisonment and rehabilitation at the same time?       I'm just talking about a matter of diction.     You would agree there are instances, in a hypothetical -       -- case, where you can receive imprisonment and rehabilitation at same time?       We're -- we're talking about what the statute says, and the question indicates, the hypothetical indicates, that those are not mutually exclusive.     You can have imprisonment and rehabilitation at same time.     Now, this case is a little different because she didn't get it, but let's just talk about the hypothetical.       Suppose the judge said I'm going to sentence you to 12 months.     Now, there is a particular facility where there is a drug treatment program that you can really benefit from, and you'd be a safer citizen, but I'm not going to mix up imprisonment and rehabilitation.     I'm not even going to make that - I'm not going to consider it.     All I'm interested in is imprisonment. Is that an abuse of discretion?     The failure to consider the factors that Congress set forth, including rehabilitation?       No, he said I -- no, he said I'm not going to consider that.       Right.       All right.       So -- so then he must consider rehabilitation in the context of imprisonment?       It -- it does seem to me that the principal trouble I have with your argument is that, as Justice Scalia mentioned, the judge can't be certain that the treatment will -- will be provided. And in an answer to an earlier question you said, well, 90 percent of the time the judge's recommendation is followed, the program is -- is offered. Suppose we're only 10 percent of the time? Suppose only 10 percent of the time could or did the Bureau of Prisons follow the judge's recommendation, wouldn't your interpretation of the statute then be very difficult to sustain?       But I still find it hard, if I were going to write the opinion, to rule for your position to ignore the 90 percent-10 percent hypothetical problem I have, to say, well now, 90 percent of the time the judge's rules are going to be followed or the judge's recommendations are going to be followed.     That's an odd way to support the interpretation of the statute that we have to -- that we have to adopt in order to rule in your favor because, as I say, suppose his position, his recommendation, were followed only 10 percent of the time?
10-5443 +++$+++        But suppose in Justice - please continue.     I interrupted you.       Suppose in Justice Alito's hypothetical, two guys on the park bench, and they find out that the man with the gray coat behind them was listening.     They say, we have to get the man with the gray coat.     They turn around and they shoot a man with a gray coat, but it's a different man.     What result?       It wasn't the man that was listening.     They got the wrong guy.       The intent was there.       But then your realistic possibility -- the realistic probability standard just falls out of your test.       Well, I think it's very difficult to instruct the jury, to say, now, sometimes there's realistic probability, sometimes there isn't.     I just don't know what this jury instruction is going to look like.       I don't see what that has to do with the defendant's intent.       Then you have to change your answer -- right?     Maybe you don't -- to my hypothetical where they shoot the wrong man.
10-545 +++$+++        Well, it seems to me what you're saying, and I'm glad you gave this answer because originally I thought I was going to put in my notes the First Amendment doesn't apply to the copyright area -- and that just can't be. What you're saying is, is that this law will pass intermediate scrutiny.     It's an important governmental interest, and it's substantially related to that.       But -- but --       But can you -- can you cite me to some -- some authority which says the First Amendment doesn't apply to a copyright --       The First Amendment test doesn't apply.     There has -- there has to be a -- a test.     Now, maybe -- say it isn't immediate scrutiny but something else.     But -- but certainly the First Amendment is implicated.
10-553 +++$+++ 
10-568 +++$+++        But it -- it seems to me that if you're going to make this argument -- and this is the point we discussed with Mr. Elwood -- there are two ways to do it.     Number one, say this infringes the right to vote, which is a First Amendment right; or you can say that this impinges unduly on necessary rights of association that preceded your election to the legislative post. It seems to me that the latter is the only way that you can make your case and to avoid the force of the argument that the Petitioner makes.       Well, I mean, but that - but that's unworkable to say, you know, that every potential -- I think I might run for office next year and so I'm going to get advice from some committee as to who I can associate with?     That just is unworkable.       What's the standard for vagueness that we apply?     We apply vagueness to First Amendment prohibitions or restrictions on speech.     We apply vagueness to criminal statutes.     This isn't a criminal statute.     It does have a civil penalty.     What is the case that I consult to see what standard of vagueness I apply?
10-577 +++$+++ 
10-6 +++$+++        It is in the red brief, the Respondent's brief, page 26, toward the bottom it says if you find, I have a problem that I do not know that they preserved this objection, but let's talk about what the standard ought to be.     At the bottom it says, if you find that the someone has directly infringed a patent and that the defendants knew or should have known that its actions would induce direct infringement.     So this means to me that in order to be liable for an inducement you can be liable if you knew or should have known.     Now, if we can just discuss this for a moment. It seems to me that this is the important point in the case because if you say should have known, then you have a standard that is less than intentional for inducers. And that means that every supplier, every business person that takes a product from a manufacturer has the duty to inquire and to find out if there is a patent. And it is a standard that is less than intentional and that is a very substantial change or a very substantial burden to impose on those who are selling and distributing products.       Well, if you say should have known, that is the necessary consequence of the holding.       Well, as you say, willful blindness was never used really until this Court and this Court has never in a full opinion for the Court adopted it even in the criminal context.     So can we talk about knowing as opposed to should have known.       But you're presenting to us the proposition, I take it, correct me if I am wrong, that we should write an opinion that is saying that know or should have known is the standard for an inducer. And I question whether that is a wise interpretation and a necessary interpretation of (b), especially as we are informed through (c) as to what (b) might mean.       If we are arguing about whether or not you can protect your judgement based upon all that's in the record, I think you may have a strong point.     But I am interested in what the standard ought to be.     I'd like you to know what a properly instructed jury should be told with reference to knowledge or something less than knowledge.       So you're saying that (b) should have a lesser standard of culpability than (c)?       You're not immune from liability for direct infringement.     You're immune from liability, under the hypothetical, for actively inducing.     And that is where there is a very substantial policy difference.       So are you saying that the standard of knowledge would be the same for direct infringement as for active inducement?       Would you say, even though you -- I think you disagree with this in this case, would you say that there is a reasonable argument in our precedent for saying that the standard of knowledge under (b) should be greater than reckless disregard?       All right.     Would you say that there is substantial authority for the proposition that it should -- the state of mind should be greater than "should have known"?
10-63 +++$+++        Particularly in a -- in a capital case.       I just have two questions going back to the very beginning, when we were talking about the misaddressed or the unreceived mail.     When the notices come back "no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell," that's just as if it said, functionally, don't you think, "wrong address"?       I mean, it's pretty clear that they didn't get their -- get the mail, get the letter, because it's sent back.       One other thing while I'm talking with you, and it's a tangential point, perhaps. Could the State of Alabama under your laws waive what you allege to be the procedural default?     If you thought there was substantial merit to the underlying claims, even though you take the position that they ultimately should be rejected, could you have simply waived the procedural default and allowed the appeal to proceed?       Has Alabama ever waived lack of timely appeal in a capital case?       Well, this goes to my earlier question, and continuing Justice Alito's line of questioning.     If the State of Alabama had told the State court, in all of the circumstances, we think there should be an out-of-time appeal granted -- you're -- are you indicating that the State court said, well, that's a good idea, but we can't do it because it's not appropriate in these circumstances?       Could the State in -- excuse me.     Could the State in the -- in the Federal litigation have waived the procedural default?
10-637 +++$+++        What's that?     Cause and prejudice?     What's the --       Oh, actual innocence.       Is Griffith a constitutional case?       Would the -- would the Congress of the United States have the authority, looking at this case, to direct Federal courts to issue habeas in this -- on these facts?       Is that then a restriction on habeas corpus?       Is there a rule of constitutional avoidance that we should interpret the statute to avoid?     Any inference that there is a restriction on habeas corpus?       No.     That's not argued.     I agree.       While we're discussing-- on a different point.     What response do you make to Mr. Fisher's point about Graham and Roper v. Simmons?       But do they?       Do they meet the Teague exception?       It seems to me it's not a question of a new trial.     It's just a question of looking at a continuing sentence and seeing the validity of a continuing sentence.
10-6549 +++$+++ 
10-680 +++$+++        No, no.     No, no, that's not the way Miranda works.     Miranda suppresses a statement that is adverse to the person who was questioned.     And the police doesn't know when the adverse statement's going to come.     So, you're running away from the hypothetical.     It just doesn't work.       And what you infer is the rule that incarceration constitutes custody.       But that is --       But that is Shatzer, and Shatzer was careful to say we've never decided that issue.       Well, it states in broader terms.     It says we've never decided whether incarceration constitutes custody for Miranda purposes and, indeed, have explicitly declined to address the issue.       It talks about Bradley, which was definitely where the issue was.
10-694 +++$+++ 
10-699 +++$+++        That seems to me different than the rationale of the D.C. Circuit.     It seems to me you're not defending the rationale of the D.C. Circuit -       -- that there's no jurisdiction.       But it does -- it does seem to me that your position would be much stronger if you said there is jurisdiction, and the President wins.       Because if this -- if this rationale remains the law and is the law, then you have the specter of constant legislative determinations that are not clearly -- not clearly invalid.     And it seems to me that's, again with all due respect, not in the best interest of the ultimate argument you're making.       I didn't hear the third.
10-704 +++$+++       And there's -- he's used a 10     specific gun, a 12-gauge Remington shotgun, and they've 11     -- and they're looking for that.    And these facts are 12     the same.    He may continue to elude the police; he may 13     attack again.    And they -- and they're searching the 14     house, his own house.    They see the one gun.    They see a 15     second gun.    They cannot take the gun, the second gun? 16                 MR. WOLFSON      I'm putting in my notes
10-708 +++$+++       Could you tell -- could 7     you tell me, just with Justice Alito's automobile 8     hypothetical, just as a matter of agency law -- I'm a 9     little rusty on this one.    If the auto repair people 10     phone and say      For you to say he was 3     entitled to it and, therefore, it's an injury, that's 4     just -- that's just circular.    That gives no substance 5     at all to the -- to the meaning of the term "injury." 6                 MR. LAMKEN the public at large. The Court has protected interests as divorced from property interests as the right to obtain 13     information from the government through FOIA or FACA. 14     It can protect your -- your non-property interest in not 15     being defamed.    All of these things are protected.    Your 16     rights to performance of your contract.    All of the 17     these things are protected whether or not there's 18     further economic harm that results. And the no further inquiry rule that's 20     applied in the trust and fiduciary contracts for years 21     is just another example where the law elevates your 22     interest in not having conflict --      I'm not sure about 19     trespass.    The object of my owning property is that I 20     have a right to exclude.    This is what I own.    This is 21     what the law protects.    This is a -- this is a spatial 22     area for --      -- for my -- which is my 25     own domain.      No, but it's essential to 19     my -- it's essential to my feeling of security and 20     dignity and privacy.    Like the Justice Breyer telephone 21     call hypothetical.
10-76 +++$+++        Well, then, you don't defend the reasoning of the State supreme court?       Well, that's an -- that's an odd way to think about general jurisdiction.     General jurisdiction is principally status -- your residence, the principal place of business, the place of incorporation.     And this -- these factors that you're mentioning are -- in fact, some of the factors you mention in the brief are quite different than that.
10-779 +++$+++        What was your page again?       Suppose you had a statute in which the pharmacy cannot give the information or sell the information to anybody; it must remain with the pharmacy.       A copy of the prescription must be given to the State of Vermont.     The State of Vermont then has the same restrictions that this statute has.     That would be LAPD.       And what -- and I want to know what your answer would be.     If LAPD is correct -       Then what ruling would we have to make in my hypothetical case?       It's not exactly not this case but just in the abstract, do we have a rule that if there are two statutes, A, the statute is passed for a bad purpose, B, the statute is not passed for a bad purpose, if the statute is otherwise the same, are they both unconstitutional or just one and why?     And what case do I look to other than maybe Church of Lukumi?
10-788 +++$+++        Well, do you agree that we should vacate and remand according to the suggestion of the Solicitor General?       And why is that?       Is it just because of your view of the evidence, that there's no evidence to justify the remand?       Well, you're saying that this was waived and was just not in the case?     Because usually if the issue wasn't discussed, that's the reason we remand.       Well, but if -- if there is -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that there is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't generally dismiss the complaint if there are other allegations in the complaint that could support liability on another theory.
10-8145 +++$+++        But just on the materiality point, I -- I just have to agree with Justice Ginsburg.     What you're telling us is that when the defense stands up and said, and isn't it true that, in this statement which you just have testified to on direct and which the police have put in on direct, you also said you could not identify any perpetrators of the murder -- and then the prosecutor says immaterial, and the judge says strike it.       I just can't believe that.       I'm talking about the Boatner statement of 3/6/95, in which Boatner told police he could not identify any of the perpetrators of the murder, JA 259-60.       And you say that's immaterial.     I find that just incredible.       Did you concede there was a Brady violation in this case?       Do you now concede--       -- there was a Brady violation in the case?       You're telling the Court that this should have been kept from the defense, all of it?       Under Brady.       Because it was not -- because it was not turned over.     And with all respect, I think you misspoke when you -- you were asked what is -- what is the test for when Brady material must be turned over.     And you said whether or not there's a reasonable probability -- a reasonable likelihood -- pardon me -- a reasonable probability that the result would have been different.     That's the test for when there has been a Brady violation.     You don't determine your Brady obligation by the test for the Brady violation.     You're transposing two very different things. And so, that's incorrect.
10-844 +++$+++ 
10-8505 +++$+++       But the -- the chain of -- 12     the chain of custody are just supporting actors.    The 13     key actor in the play, the Hamlet in the play, is the 14     person who did the test at Cellmark, and she or he is 15     not here.    And if you want to say, oh, this is not -- 16     tell the jury, now, we're not saying that this is 17     admitted for the truth, we're not saying that this is 18     Williams' DNA, the judge would say, well, then it's 19     irrelevant, it's excluded.      And it seems to me, in -- 22     as in response to Justice Scalia, that not only does he 23     indicate that this is hard to distinguish from Bullcoming; in Bullcoming, at least you had an expert 25     say how the laboratory works.    Here, you don't even have that.      You have less here with 4     reference to Cellmark than you did in Bullcoming.      I don't know how that's 5     any different from Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz.      None of -- none of which 24     has anything to do with the accuracy of the test.      As you understand our 25     precedents, would this have been a stronger or a weaker case if a representative, an employee, of Cellmark had 2     come and said, although I didn't do this sample, I want 3     to tell you how our procedures work and why we're a 4     respectable lab, et cetera, et cetera?
10-875 +++$+++ 
10-879 +++$+++        It's not -- it's not clear --       It's not clear to me why a railroad executive couldn't say, now I need to use 10 locomotives in this division because I will be using two of them every week in the repair shop to repair them, right?     I don't know why that isn't use, but you don't -- you don't seem to agree with that.       Now, I know it's use on the line, but it seems to me that the repair shop is an obvious extension of the line.     Everybody knows that it's going to have to spend, I don't know, 1 day a month in the repair shop, and that's just part of -- of the use.       Suppose --       Suppose the allegation is there's a failure to warn workers to use a special kind of mask that's very important if you're working near asbestos.     That's the claim they want.     Now, are you saying that the manufacturer cannot be required to give that warning?       Are you also saying the railroad cannot be forced to give that warning in its repair shop?       No, no.     That was my -- can the railroad be held liable for failing to tell the worker to use the mask?       But you could -- could State law say you need a special kind of mask?       What about an independent contractor who's not covered by FELA?       Under State law which by hypothesis says you need this very special kind of mask. It's required only in Illinois.       Could the railroad be held liable for failure to give that kind of mask under State law if it's not a FELA worker?       Let me ask this question Is it your position that the -- that the engine is as much in use when it's in the shop as when it's running on the track?     Is that your position?       Well, the reason it seems to me somewhat important is that I can't conceive of 50 different State regulations for the kind of gloves and things that the engineer has to wear on -- when he's running the train on the track.     And if that's so, it seems to me it would help you to say that the shop was the same, but you seem to say the shop was different.       Well, do we have to reach this failure-to-warn problem in this case?
10-895 +++$+++ 
10-8974 +++$+++        And what you're -- what you're saying, I take it, in the answer to Justice Kagan, was that there's really a two-part step.     First, was the police procedure unnecessarily suggestive?     And then if it was, are there other reliability -- was reliability impaired? So, you go -- you ask both questions.       What -- what about cases with inflammatory evidence, too many lurid photos or testimony that ignites prejudice in the community? That's -- that's a -- that's reliability.       It is interesting.     I was trying to find a case where some other class of evidence was excluded because it's unreliable.     And as -- Thompson v. Louisville, as you say, is just insufficient evidence, and that's different.     Inflammatory evidence might be an example.       Lurid photos or something like that.       I think there were some early cases when fingerprint testimony couldn't come in, when fingerprint technology was just new.     I don't know if those were due process or not.       Was the -- was the Daubert case, our expert witness case where you have to have a threshold showing -- was that due process or was that just -- that was just rule of evidence.       Is tea-leaf reading okay?
10-930 +++$+++        Well, is he under duty to raise it as soon as possible, at the risk of forfeiture if he doesn't?     That's the import of the question.       Well, that's why I'm asking. (Laughter.)
10-945 +++$+++        Does the record or common experience justify an argument that if you have the person who's stopped just for a traffic ticket, but that person is going to be in custody for 5 or 6 days, that person might well prefer an institution where everyone has been searched before he or she is put into the population with -       I understand most of the general propositions that your side is advancing, but I have to say I was somewhat surprised at the evidence of the amount of contraband that was discovered, the amount of weapons that was discovered that's in the literature and that's in the citations, of course, was somewhat skimpy.     I thought there would be a stronger showing than I -- than I found in the briefs.
10-948 +++$+++        Can you get -- can you get damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the arbitration?       Suppose the case were reversed.     The liability section says you have a right to sue, and the disclosure section says you have a right to sue or go to arbitration.     What result then?       It seems to me that under your -- well, I'll let you answer.
10-9646 +++$+++        Life without parole is the minimum?       That's also -- that's also the maximum because there could be no death penalty.       Are juries instructed that life without parole is a necessary consequence of their decision?     I suppose a defense attorney could argue it.       I would think so.       In the -- in the Petitioner's briefs, the idea of deterrence kind of drops by the way side.     Have there been any studies that show that there is a deterrence value?     I remember in Roper, there was actually discussion among the young people before they committed the crime as to whether or not they could get the penalty.     It was actually right there in the record.     Does the State rely on the deterrence component of the punishment here?       Is it retribution?       Retribution, of course, is related to personal culpability.     We said that in Tison, and that loops back into the minor problem.       Are you aware of any statistics that give us some quantitative sense as to how many juveniles after years and years of prison show significant rehabilitation?     Do we know anything about that?       If the judge were to determine under a rule that the sentence can't be mandatory whether or not life should be imposed, what would be the sorts of factors that he would look at, or do you think those are just too ineffable, too imprecise to be considered?       They're the standard sorts of mitigating circumstances that we see in capital cases, you think?
10-98 +++$+++        Just a point of detail. I -- I may not be recalling correctly.     You said this statute is rarely used.     I thought there were 4,000 material witness hearings a year.     Is that mostly because of the immigration?       Do we -- do we -- do we have statistics for the States, how many States hold - how many people are held under State material witness statutes?       I'm not sure why that just can't be resolved under the issue of materiality.     The magistrate asks the prosecutor why he wants to do this, and he infers from what the prosecutor said that -- just what you say.     Then it's not material.     It's not a case.
10-9995 +++$+++  
105, Orig. +++$+++                 Do you think it includes printing fees?                You don't -- you don't think that --                -- what number here?     You don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge for printing fees?              Well, the reason I ask is because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are in -- in the same sentence.              So if you allowed printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under 1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to witness fees.              Except 1911 may do two things.   Number one it may authorize the Supreme Court to fix the fees to be charged by the clerk.                 And then in the second paragraph it for taxing of those fees, the cost of serving process and other necessary disbursements; so it does two things.
11-10189 +++$+++        But then -- but the comment is that the record has to be done within a very short period of time, and the -- and the trial record isn't even available for -- the transcript, for some 7 months.       So the new counsel on Page 24 direct waits for 7 months, gets the transcript.     In the meantime, let's assume has made some investigation, and he said -- and he tells the appellate court, we have some very important material that we want to introduce and we need to supplement the record; please remand this case.       That -- that has never happened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take it?       Well, but you -- you say it's before, but this -- this indicates how Texas views its system.     And, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, Texas views this system as being one in which the collateral appeal -- or the collateral proceeding counsel is in the best position to raise IAC claims. That's -- that's just where it is.     And the -- the State Bar says -- agrees with the Respondent -- pardon me -- with the Petitioner on this point.       This is -- this is very amusing in a capital case. Let me ask you this question:     Is there anything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps your position?     I'm -- I'm very interested in the State Bar brief.     It's a little hard for me to parse.     It did say there is a conflict of interest in -- between the habeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct. And it also -- it also indicates that the habeas counsel has to file the application in the convicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not later than 45 days after the State's original brief, which seems to help the Petitioner here because the original brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is deemed important for the habeas counsel.
11-1025 +++$+++        But both in Summers and Monsanto the government tells us:     We knew that the governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew that, the question was substantial risk.
11-10362 +++$+++        Okay.     And then -- then take that theory and track through the statute to show me how that theory works, which is what your opening argument was going to do.       So how does that argument help your case?       A prisoner -- a prisoner is supposed to be back in his cell block at 6:00 in the evening, he isn't, he's on the recreation yard, he's somewhat recalcitrant, and two guards carry him back to the cell block.     Is that an arrest?       Well, he's violating the prison regulations.       And that's not a law enforcement function as contemplated by the statute, in your view?
11-1059 +++$+++        Do we take this case on the premise that you would have objected if a judgment had been entered in your favor for the full amount, plus attorneys' fees?
11-1085 +++$+++        Doesn't -- doesn't that assume that the efficient market theory is always relevant to materiality?     And there might be instances in which there is subjective reliance, which we inquire into, that is objectively reasonable, but that does not involve a fraud on the market?       Well, that -- that --       You -- you are saying that, if everyone loses, if it's not material, that's a common issue, and therefore, the trial court at the certification stage does not have to determine it.       I'm not sure how that's different from what I said.     But in other -- in other words, you are saying that market efficiency is just presumed, and everybody wins or everybody loses, and so you can have a class action, even though the trial judge is convinced that there is no adequate common market theory to support the common -- the common injury.       Well, you have the -- you have the burden of justifying class certification --       -- is that not correct?       All right.     Now, suppose there is some real question of whether or not the causal chain hasn't been broken, the causal chain between the misstatement and the movement in price.     Don't you have to prove the integrity of the causal chain?       At the certification stage?       You say it's material even though there is no cause in fact?     I don't understand that.       Well, that then -- that imparts the question of 24 years of economic scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since Basic was decided -- has shown that the -- the efficient market theory is -- is really -- really an overgeneralization.     It could be much more subtle than that and so you have an advanced theory.     But you want us to ignore that.
11-1118 +++$+++        But getting back -- Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought, that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that there is exclusive jurisdiction.     And her question to me pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other areas of exclusive jurisdiction.     If that is going to be your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest. That's all that question meant to me. Certainly -- certainly, you -- you could have cases where there is concurrent jurisdiction, 1983, in which we'd have the same problem.
11-1160 +++$+++        Well, is it a fair characterization of your argument -- is it a fair characterization of your argument to say that the possibility that the hospital authority can use this general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent to the legislature intending that it be used that way? Is that your argument?
11-1175 +++$+++  
11-1221 +++$+++        In the -- in the Wissner case, there was a community property State.     Do you know, under the statute we're dealing with here, is community property in those States also preempted so that the -- the insured is the sole owner of the policy?       Because it was a specific provision on that point in Wissner, and I -- or the Court so read it.     And I take it the same provision applies -- exists in this statute?       But your -- your concern is there might be fraudulent wills?       Well, it seems to me that's grasping at straws.
11-1231 +++$+++        I'm not sure how we can limit this to agency misconduct.     Suppose there is a computer glitch in a program, completely good faith, and the computer just spits out the -- the wrong information, and nobody knows about it.     That's not misconduct.       And -- but --       But you would say no equitable tolling in that case?       I mean, that would be good cause.     It seems to me that would be good cause under the -- under the Secretary's rules.       Well, I don't know -- I don't know why it wouldn't.       You mean to say that if that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3 years?       Yes.       Yes.       Well, I just find it hard -- hard to see why this is -- you're saying that the equitable tolling rule -- the agency does have the 3-year rule.       It is limited to misconduct?       So you're arguing for -- in a way, for a narrower rule than what the government --
11-1274 +++$+++       Are -- are there cases discussing whether or not a government agency has been diligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation? You see, in the private context we have some sense of what the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's rights.    He has to be diligent.    But to transpose that to a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over -- overworked or underfunded?    I don't -- which way do you come out when the government says that?       Well, perhaps I've missed something.     I -- I came in here thinking that both parties were willing to concede for purposes of this case that there was a fraudulent concealment.     Is that -- is that wrong?       I mean, for purposes of presenting the statute of limitations issue that's before us.       That's correct.
11-1285 +++$+++        The general rule in equity was that the equity court would not give a specific performance decree to pay a certain amount of money, was the general rule.     Were there exceptions?       And -- and if so, do those exceptions bear on this case?       We -- you don't view the case as?
11-1327 +++$+++ 
11-1347 +++$+++        Well, except he might have assumed that the issue of fees would still be alive if the Eleventh Circuit ruled on the merits.       And he -- he was just trying to have a single appeal.       Well, appellate courts all the time have issues where they apply different standards to multiple issues in the case.       Well, that, of course -- on your premise, that's right.     On their premise, it's wrong, that -- the issue of custody is still alive under their perspective.     That's what we are arguing about, so you're just assuming your own premise.       But I am -- I am quite surprised that you would say that prior residence can never bear on present residence.     In custody disputes, this happens all the time.     The child spent 5 years in this country, 4 years in that country; now, for the last 2 years, the child has been in this country -- the previous experience of the child has a tremendous bearing on custody. To say that it's only now, prospective only, after the child has been removed, I just think is wrong, as a matter of custody law.       Well, again, you're just assuming that the district judge is right, but that's the whole issue.     And as the Chief Justice indicates, under your position, we give a premium to the very sort of precipitant action that the Hague Convention is designed to avoid.
11-1351 +++$+++        Well, you did -- you did say, in the reply brief, that the point of the Gonzalez Act, it says, "would enable plaintiffs to pursue those claims against the United States."       I know you would have been disappointed if we didn't ask you about this.       And I -- but it -- and Justice Kagan indicated, this wasn't just an aside. This was rather a central theory for your interpretation of the Act; maybe not the only theory, but a central theory.
11-139 +++$+++        Were most of the --       And I --       I was going to ask in conjunction with Justice Kagan's discussion, were the pre-Colony cases that involved splits -- did most of those or any of those relate to the sales of goods and services or were they all real estate sales?     Do --       Well, but the Congress drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's question, when it talks just about goods and services.       And the other reason, it was goods and services.     There's always FIFO and LIFO. I mean, there's -- you know, taxpayers who sell goods have inventory cushions.     And so, the IRS is very, very well aware that that kind of judgment is involved in all these statements.     It's not quite the same with basis.
11-1425 +++$+++        Suppose the magistrate is unavailable because he or she is ill?      Would you agree that that's an exigent circumstance which would allow a warrantless blood sample?       Well, we -- we know the defense attorneys love it when there's a delay because then the retrograde analysis has more and more contingencies that make it unreliable.       I mean, you'd much rather examine the State's expert if the sample was taken three hours than if it were -- after the arrest than one. I mean, that's a given.
11-1447 +++$+++        Suppose -- suppose the agency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let you develop your land, if you contribute a million dollars to our new football stadium?       Well, let's -- let's put -- let's put it this way:     I take it, it's -- it's a given that the government cannot take an easement on your property.     It cannot use your property for its own purposes.     It cannot park its trucks there.     It cannot cut the grass. Why is it that, if it can't do those, it can still force you, as a condition to using your property to its highest and best use, to pay them money?       Why isn't that an equal burden -- why isn't that an equal use of the property by the government?       Well, in Penn Coal v. Mahon, the government didn't enter the property.     It didn't take the property in the physical sense of moving in inappropriate.     It just says, congratulations, you have some coal under your land, and we hope you enjoy it because you can't move it. And we said that is a taking, that is a regulation that goes too far.     And it deprived, as Justice Breyer indicated, the owner of investment-backed expectations, although that word wasn't in Penn-Mahon.
11-1450 +++$+++        Are you -- are you saying that (6) doesn't apply at this point?       Because (6) talks about class action, and it says the duty of the district court --       -- is to aggregate the claims of the individual class members.       But what you're saying in your answer to Justice Breyer -- and I don't think you've really addressed his point -- that the statute number 6 says "shall aggregate the individual claim." What you're saying is that the simplest thing is to evade the statute.     Evasion is simple.     And therefore, we still use that approach because the simplest is the best. That just is not responsive to his question.
11-1518 +++$+++        Was there a finding of recklessness in the State court?       Is the crime of embezzlement proven if you show recklessness?     Or do you need a further criminal intent?       Well, of course, that's one of the things we are arguing about here.     I don't think that's conceded.       Well, a number of embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully intend to pay everything back once things turn out all right.     But there's still an embezzlement.     But there is also a criminal intent at the time, or a wrongful intent, even if -- even if you plan to pay it back. And it -- it seems to me that you're standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means something different than fraud in the first clause, or embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause.       And the problem is, as the -- your friend on the other side points out, that there's two problems with this.     Number one, it's not consistent with these -- with the meaning of the other three terms in the -- in the statute; and two, it's not consistent with the idea that discharges should be freely given so that debtors can begin again.       Unlike fraud -- fraud, larceny and embezzlement?
11-1545 +++$+++        As -- as to that specific provision?       But the -- the agencies have no historic responsibility or tradition, quite unlike Article III courts, of safeguarding the Federal balance.       Unelected Federal bureaucrats. (Laughter.)
11-159 +++$+++ 
11-161 +++$+++        So, I think maybe if you prevail in this opinion, we should say the principle we are adopting in this case is:     Don't trust the government.       But you don't -- you don't -       You don't dispute that the city would have that option if we rule against you.       Just not to forgive the unpaid balances.     The city has the option, I assume.       That's a -- that's a big difference.     In one case, there's an expectation; in the other case, there isn't.       But that just -       That just underscores the promise of the State -- or the city that all owners will be treated equally.     That just underscores the point that that was the understanding and the commitment.       Well, why is that -- why is that a big deal for us?     I mean, that's the law.     You get your -- your choice.       What do you do with the hypothetical about the income tax and the sales tax? So, you don't pay any income tax if the sales tax had gone into effect.
11-166 +++$+++  
11-182 +++$+++        But the hypothetical is that that's all the legislature is doing.       Now, are you talking about 3 now or --       -- or does this argument relate to 2 as well?       Suppose -- suppose -- well, assume these are two hypothetical -- two hypothetical instances. First, the Federal government has said, we simply don't have the money or the resources to enforce our immigration laws the way we wish.     We wish we could do so, but we don't have the money or the resources. That's the first -- just hypothetical.       Also -- also hypothetical is that the state of Arizona has -- has a massive emergency with social disruption, economic disruption, residents leaving the state because of flood of immigrants.     Let's just assume those two things. Does that give the state of Arizona any powers or authority or legitimate concerns that any other state wouldn't have?       And can they go to their legislature and say, we're concerned about this, and ask the legislature to enact laws to correct this problem?       So you're saying the government has a legitimate interest in not enforcing its laws?
11-184 +++$+++ 
11-192 +++$+++ 
11-199 +++$+++        Suppose you have a case in which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge, and the trial judge said:     I now acknowledge that this court committed error in introducing item 10 in evidence.     And the court remembers that when this came into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was transfixed, jurors were weeping.     This was the high point of the trial. That's wrong for the judge to say.     All he has to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1 through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a rational jury -- so, that's the end of it.     Judges do the -- do what I suggested all the time.       Suppose -- suppose the judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on this evidence that that's all they would have looked at, but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible evidence, they would still have found guilt. Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --       -- a proper application of the -- of the framework?       The Chief Justice allowed me to ask one question.     Could I amend your statement so that you would say a rational jury in all the circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard, would have?
11-204 +++$+++        What is -- what is this commitment?     Is the commitment in writing?       Would it be lawful to make it -- put it in writing?       Would it be lawful to put it in writing?       That sounds to me it's not a commitment, unless the doctor says:     Well, I'll look at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your material, I'll think about it. Is that -- is that a --       And that's why -- and that's why it's not in writing.       Well, let me ask you this, and I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the specifics, but my understanding is that the Federal Government has expressed new concerns, has new regulations, new rules about these outside sales. Does that mean that the nature of the work has changed in the last 5 or 10 years, so that the years we are talking about is not relevant?     Would you comment on that?       What's the case that I cite if this opinion is written the way you -- you propose, and the -- this Court says, well, this has been years, or maybe in 10 years if you take the new regulations as setting a new regime, and the Department has never made an objection.     And, therefore, it follows that the Department's interpretation is implausible or improper, and then I cite some case from our Court. What -- how do I write this?       Well, I'd like one. (Laughter.)
11-210 +++$+++        Well, it's a matter - it's a matter of common sense that it, it seems to me - that it demeans the medal.     Let me ask you this:     What do you do with the statute that prohibits the wearing of a medal that has not been earned?       Well, I'm not so sure. You know, the Tinker case with the arm band; it's purely expressive speech, it seems to me.     I think if you prevail here that the wearing prohibition must also be in serious doubt.       But I think it is, if the whole purpose of the person who puts the medal on his tuxedo that he didn't earn is an expressive purpose. That's pure expression.       Well, don't you think that's the case?     There's no non-expressive purpose that I can think of.       That's just the basic definition of fraud in the criminal law.
11-246 +++$+++        What were the provisions, if any, in the Indian Reorganization Act itself that show a concern for the kind of standing that you're alleging here? It seems to me you're talking about environmental effects and so forth under the Indian Gaming Act, but yet your primary suit is under the Indian Reorganization Act.     So I don't see -- I understand how that might give you standing, but how does it give you a cause of action for relief under the Indian Reorganization Act?       The Indian Reorganization Act, just to help pursue the question a little bit further, has a provision about the public interest, but not in the section that you're relying on.     It doesn't say anything about the public interest.       463 does, but you're going under 465.       What is the specific provision of the IRA that you rely on?     You -- do you go back to 463?     Because there's nothing in 465 that answers your -- this question, I don't think.       That's helpful.     Just a different question, going back to what -- Justice Alito's question.     It does seem that we may be wasting our time.     I'm not suggesting that the State -- that the case is moot, but you did wait for some 3 years before you brought this suit.     The building was built.     It seems to me there's a considerable laches problem.     I suppose that's just not before us.       But that was under the MichGO suit, not yours.       Oh, your suit had been filed at that point.
11-262 +++$+++ 
11-338 +++$+++        But -- but, in other words, it goes -- under your view, it would go back to the district court; the district court would try all this.     And, as the Chief Justice says, we know what the law of the case is, if -- if the opinion stands.       And -- and so isn't - isn't it fairly clear, well, we know that the district court must do under the court of appeals' decision?       Excuse me.     This is page 18.     That's -- that's the last page?       And -- and so I'm reading under where it says, "stormwater discharges"?       Thank you.       But then -- but then why -- why isn't your -- aren't your concerns met if we vacate for the court of appeals to consider, in the first instance, the extent to which this regulation may bear on its opinion?
11-345 +++$+++        So what you're saying is that what counts is race above all?       Well, that's the necessary -- that's the necessary response to Justice Alito's question.       You want underprivileged of a certain race and privileged of a certain race.     So that's race.       But the -- but the reason you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of that race who are privileged can be representative, and that's race.     I just --       If I could, before we get to that.       Suppose we -- that you, in your experience identify a numerical category a numerical standard, a numerical designation for critical mass:     It's X percent.     During the course of the admissions process, can the admissions officers check to see how close they are coming to this numerical --       You -- you cannot do that?       But isn't that what happened in Grutter; it allowed that.       So are you saying that Grutter is incorrect?       I'm -- I'm asking whether or not you could do that.     And if --       I just don't understand this argument.     I thought that the whole point is that sometimes race has to be a tie-breaker and you are saying that it isn't.     Well, then, we should just go away.     Then -- then we should just say you can't use race, don't worry about it.
11-393 +++$+++        But there's no Article III jurisdictional problem in Justice Alito's hypothetical, that this is a remedial exercise of the Court's power to explain the consequences of its judgment in this case.       But when you say "judicial restraint" --       When you say "judicial restraint," you are echoing the earlier premise that it increases the judicial power if the judiciary strikes down other provisions of the Act.     I suggest to you it might be quite the opposite.     We would be exercising the judicial power, if one Act was -- one provision was stricken and the others remained, to impose a risk on insurance companies that Congress had never intended. By reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that Congress did not provide for, did not consider.     That, it seems to me, can be argued at least to be a more extreme exercise of judicial power than to strike -- than striking the whole.       I just don't accept the premise.       But I still don't understand where you are with the answer to Justice Alito's question. Assume that there is a -- a substantial probability that the 350 billion plus 350 billion equals 7 is going to be cut in half if the individual mandate is stricken.     Assume there is a significant possibility of that.     Is it within the proper exercise of this Court's function to impose that kind of risk?     Can we say that the Congress would have intended that there be that kind of risk?       But isn't that -- isn't that the point, then, why we should just assume that it is not severable?       If we -- if we lack the competence to even assess whether there is a risk, then isn't this an awesome exercise of judicial power?       To say we're doing something and we're not telling you what the consequences might be?       I don't quite understand about the employers.     You're saying Congress mandated employers to buy something that Congress itself has not contemplated?     I don't understand that.       Based on the assumption that the cost of those policies would be lowered by certain provisions which are, by hypothesis -- we're not sure -- by hypothesis, are in doubt.       But you're saying we have -- we have the expertise to make the inquiry you want us to make, i.e., the guaranteed issue, but not the expertise that Justice Alito's question suggests we must make.       I just don't understand your position.       So, do you want us to write an opinion saying we have concluded that there is an insignificant risk of a substantial adverse effect on the insurance companies -- that's our economic conclusion -- and therefore not severable?     That's what you want me to say?       Is that the real Congress or a hypothetical Congress? (Laughter.)
11-45 +++$+++ 
11-460 +++$+++        But you still have to show that there is a contributor.     And I've been through these sections, and it seems to me that a reasonable interpretation of this section is that there is a violation if a particular permittee violates. And what I'm taking away from your argument is that, once there is a violation, all the permittees are liable, and that just can't be.       Is that the 109 language you cite?       Why is there no -- where do I look to find out that the district is making a discharge of polluted water, other than under the Ninth Circuit's theory that it's in the river itself?       So is your theory that, if the district is permitted to -- on a scale of 1 to 10, to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable for the increase, even though other dischargees might have made this?       I don't get that from what you have read.     I've looked at --   -- the text you've read and it looks to me like it's permittee by permittee.       So if each permittee is allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8; then both permittees are liable?       No, no, we now know the facts because it's the hypothetical.
11-465 +++$+++        Of course, again this is fact-specific to the case.     It doesn't address the rule that we want to address and was the reason for us taking the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment. It seems to me that the Federal constitutional claim was intertwined with and -- and controlling of the procedural matters that the court discussed.     I just don't see the case is here even on your theory.
11-551 +++$+++        So you think now -- you say you don't want us to mention "not to exceed" in our opinion --       -- other than to say that it's irrelevant?       Does the Redbook talk about "not to exceed" as being any different from general appropriations?       Does the Redbook --       Does the Redbook refer to "not to exceed" -- the "not to exceed" language?       Does the Redbook have -- refer to the "not to exceed" language?       So, in your view, if the tribe comes to the government, and they say, look, we've been looking at what you've done with the other tribes, you've appropriated $95 million, and the appropriation says "not to exceed $95 million," but go ahead and make this contract with us anyway, no one cares.     And you say, go ahead and make it.     Right?       That's your -- that's your position, isn't it?       Suppose you did know. Suppose the tribe knew that the 95 million -- let's assume that that's the not to exceed amount -- had already been obligated.     Could the tribe then go ahead and make the government -- a contract with the government, and would the government have to make that contract, in your view?       Is it your argument that the answer to that is yes?       Isn't this more specific language than the general language?     Doesn't this specific language, "not to exceed," supersede the general obligation to make the contract?     Otherwise, it's meaningless.     The "not to exceed language" is meaningless.       You say it's meaningless.       You just go to the Judgment Fund --       -- which makes it meaningless.
11-556 +++$+++ 
11-564 +++$+++        That's your first reason and I don't want you to be deterred from giving us the second, but if we can concentrate on that for a minute. That seems to me a proposition that's equally unacceptable to what the government is saying, that you have no interest in contraband.     The police often, when they have ordinary conversation with people, want to find out the details of what that person is doing, where the person lives, what goes on in the house. "Hello, have you had a nice time at the -- at the park today?     I see you're coming home with your children; is this where you live?"     This is all routine conversation that we always have in order to try to find out what people are doing, what they are like, where they live.     So I -- I think the statement, and you -- you repeated it quite accurately from what you have at page 16 of your brief -- just goes too far.     Our decisions "establish that police action which reveals any detail an individual seeks to keep private is a search" -- that is just a sweeping proposition that in my view, at least, cannot be accepted in this case.     I think it's just too sweeping and wrong.       Well, the police officer talked with somebody at the police station, or walking down the street about what their occupation is, do they work at home.     They're -- they are trying to get information.     That's perfectly legitimate.       Well, then your broad statement simply does not work.       Yes, I was going to ask for your second, your second point.       How is that different from what Justice Breyer I think correctly indicated, our inquiry as to whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy?     In a way, that's circular because if we say there is, then there is, if we say there isn't, then there isn't. But if we're looking at community values in general, isn't it a reasonable expectation of privacy?       Let me ask this.     I think I know what your answer would be.     Suppose the policemen have little microphones on so they can talk into their radio, the microphone on their lapel.     Suppose the policeman goes to the homeowner and he has the microphone in his lapel on so his partner can hear the conversation, and they can -- the two of them talk about it later.     They're talking to the homeowner.     Is that an unlawful search?       It doesn't occur to him that that mike is on.       But -- but maybe it is a reasonable expectation, maybe it isn't.     I frankly think that might be harder than the dog case or that you can make a stronger case for a reasonable expectation of privacy.     If the -- if the homeowner is making a lot of marijuana with -- with odors coming out, he knows that a dog or a person might smell it.       It does hinge on what is a reasonable expectation of privacy.       And that's what we're trying to find out.
11-5683 +++$+++        But the Government is arguing and the Petitioner is arguing for a uniform rule, the rule that the time of sentencing controls.       So that uniformity doesn't quite answer it, unless I misunderstood -       But Justice Kagan's question concerning what interest is served by your position has particular force when we're talking about the sentencing judge.     The hardest thing -- as we know in the judicial system, one of the hardest things is sentencing.     And you're saying that a sentencing judge who knows the law has been changed, who knows the law has been criticized, is nevertheless bound to determine that it's fair for this -- for this person to be sentenced to the longer term. That's a very difficult -       -- position to put the judge in.     Now, I would -       Go ahead.
11-597 +++$+++        And the only difference in that formulation and this case is that it was for seven years and not permanent?     Is that your --       Well, the hypothetical is, suppose it doesn't.     Suppose that there's some land that's up -- that's fairly far upstream from the main reservoir, but it's flooded once every other year.       Your -- but your position seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not the Government.     There's a series of administrative actions and it's not really the Government's water. It's like -- it's like the old moral refuge that the rocket designers take:     You know, I make the rockets go up; where -- where they come down is not my concern.
11-626 +++$+++        We -- we want I suppose to give the courts of appeals a test that works.     I -- see if this is, sums up your argument, or your position. You look to see the objective characteristic, the physical capacity of the -- of the structure, and then you look not to purpose but to its objective function:     Does it carry goods under the statute.     And then I suppose you could under that say that this is a vessel, but that this presumption is overcome if it's permanently moored in a way the Evansville dredge was.     Is -- is that your argument?       Even if it's rather permanently moored with a, with a -- like the Intrepid on the Hudson River --       With about -- aircraft carrier.     But it's really fixed in there with regular walkways and so forth.     Very -- it would cause a lot of work in order to move it.
11-681 +++$+++    But in talking about First Amendment interests, let me ask you this: Is it not a standard issue in collective bargaining for the employees' union to talk about the size of the workforce?   Well, it's necessarily so if they're talking about hours.   All right. And would you think that this is a legitimate subject of collective bargaining for which the nonunion member has to pay?   No, I'm talking about let's say the teachers' union. They're talking about classroom size. They're talking about hours. That necessarily involves the size of the workforce, does it not.   It's not only possible; it's necessarily true. Let's assume that it's true.   Let's -- let's assume that it's true, that a union's position necessarily affects the size of government. Is not the size of government a question on which there are fundamental political beliefs -- fundamental convictions that are being sacrificed if a nonunion member objects to this line of policy? Are there not other union proposals that say -- that State employee's salary must be a certain percentage of the total -- total State expenditure? Does this not also involve the size of government, which is a fundamental issue of political belief?   I'm not talking about a question of public concern. I'm talking about whether or not a union can take money from an employee who objects to the union's position on fundamental political grounds.   And I'm -- I'm asking the justification for that under the First Amendment.   In -- in an era where government is getting bigger and bigger, and this is becoming more and more of an important issue to more people.   Well, you say it's a fair share, but that's the issue in the case if you're looking at the legitimacy of Abood.   I mean, you say it's fair share. The objectors to Abood say that it isn't.   Suppose the young person thinks that the State is squandering his heritage on unnecessary and excessive payments for benefits and wages. Is that not a political belief of the highest order? And -- you know, we talk about free riders, which is an epithetical phrase. Maybe the objecting employee would say that the union is a speech distorter; it is taking views that are not his and making them mandatory subject to bargaining and charging him for it.   So your position is that the public employees must surrender a substantial amount of First Amendment rights to work for the government?
11-697 +++$+++        We need to know about those hypotheticals in order to decide this case.       You're aware of the fact that if we write an opinion with the -- with the rule that you propose, that we should, as a matter of common sense, ask about the consequences of that rule.     And that's what we are asking.
11-702 +++$+++        But you've answered Justice Kagan's question by -- she said, doesn't your own interpretation of this statute require the opposite result and -- or the -- the harsh result? And you say, well, suppose Congress wrote a statute this way.     But that wasn't her question.     The question is --       You -- you said that Congress could write a new statute.     Of course, Congress could write a new statute, but what about this one?       If you do not -- if you do not prevail in this case, can you simply solve this problem in the discretionary removal proceedings?       You just say we're going to -- we're going to order you removed, unless you bring in evidence that this was a minor amount, period.       Well, don't you think it's -- it's, under the law and under administrative practice, that it's an option available to you?
11-713 +++$+++        Let me ask you this Suppose that this -- all the facts are the same except that this is in a State that is not subject to section 5. Would there be a problem in your view with what the district -- with what the district court did, with Judge Smith -- with what Judge Smith did?       Right.       And then we could -- then there would be no problem with using Texas as a benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting point?       As a starting point?       Isn't it odd that this is a section 2 suit, and yet section 5 seems to be driving that -- driving it.     That's the problem with this litigation, it seems to me.       And section 5 applies only to -- to some States and not others.     Texas is at a tremendous disadvantage here in defending the section 2 suit and in drawing -- and in having -- and the judiciary is at a disadvantage in -- in framing a remedy for a likely -- a likely section 2 violation in some of the districts.       Well, I wonder if it should take precedence in a section 2 suit.     That's all this court -- this is the primary obligation of the Texas district court, is to address section 2 violations.       Well, it's not giving effect to the uncleared plan.     It's giving effect to a legislative judgment as to what is workable for all the factors and criteria that Justice Alito referred to, county lines, et cetera.       But could it -- could it look at the district and say, well, it respects county lines; it follows a river; it's got urban and rural. Could it look at it for that reason?       And rely on the legislative judgment as making a sound judgment that the river runs through here, and the county line is there and so forth?     That's -- that's what seems to me the difficulty with saying, oh, you can't look at the plan.       Can we infer from either the ambiguity or -- or the other reading of the sentence that the Chief Justice suggested that, in the court's view, it was desirable to have a minority coalition district?     I draw that inference.       A minority coalition district?       All right.     So, you would defend the plan on the ground that this is a sound result?       Is there anything in the opinion from the three-judge court in the District of Columbia that indicates that there are some likely potential violations that are section 2 violations as well as section 5 violations?       And -- and I can amend that to -- and in the submission of the parties?       Yes.       The second -- the second being section 2 violations as well.       Do you have substantive objections to the plans suggested by Judge Smith in the house and congressional districts?       Oh -- no, do you have some section 2 objections?     Well, that doesn't quite work. You have to talk about retrogression, I suppose.
11-770 +++$+++        I think -- I think we have to take the case on the assumption -- I agree with you there probably was probable cause -- but I think you have to take the case on the assumption that there was no probable cause to arrest, because they didn't -- they did not rely on that authority.       Justice Kagan had the hypothetical of the person leaving to go to work, the :00 to 5:00 person.     Suppose the warrant's going to be executed at 5:00.     Can they detain him at his office so that he doesn't go back -- He always goes right home.     He takes the Number 3 bus, and he will be there in 20 minutes.     Can you detain him at the office under your rule?       No, under the rule you're proposing.       I don't know -- I don't know why not, under the rule that's proposed.
11-796 +++$+++        But correct me -- correct me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.       Could -- could you prevail in this case if we focused just on use rather than make?       I do have this problem that goes back to Justice Scalia's example.     What about the commodity bin that has 2 percent of the patented seeds in them?     Now, you get away from the article by saying, oh, well, almost all seeds are Roundup these days.     But let's have some different commodity where there are three or four different patented items, but 1 percent, 2 percent of the seeds are in the bin.     You can't -- you can't sell those.     That seems to me a very extreme result.       You can't sell them if they know they are going to be used for seeds, and you can't use them for seeds even though there is only 1 percent of the seeds?
11-798 +++$+++        You are saying that you can do by contract what you cannot do by regulation. And I don't understand that argument when there are criminal penalties that attach to the breach of the contract.
11-817 +++$+++        Do you understand the government to disagree with that general position?     In other words, the trial court, if you have an attorney that's really concerned about the training of this dog, they can ask about it.       Excuse me.     Did you say it can or it can't?
11-820 +++$+++        Well, as I recall, correct me if I'm wrong, one of the principal sources the Court cited in Padilla was common sense.       Does common sense change?       I mean, Tom Paine wrote about it, so, you know, since its original.       What is -- what is the standard that you wish us to apply?     A new rule is announced when -- when you fill in the blank.     And after you fill in the blank, is your principal argument that here the distinction is between the direct consequences of the conviction that are under the control of the Court and collateral consequences?     Two different questions.       That's a little bit like the AEDPA standard.       But the second part of my question that you were about to answer was whether or not it's dictated by precedent, and in this case, it was not dictated by precedent because it applied to collateral consequences; or, what's the because?
11-864 +++$+++        One of my -- one of my questions in the case is this:     There was a question to Mr. Estrada with reference to a jury trial.     But there's -- there's -- the judge doesn't really have a gate -- what do you call it -- a gatekeeper function here.     There is no -- there's no jury. And if the judge admits the evidence and if it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of reliability, then he can exclude it.     I don't -- I don't see why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm going to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether this is reliable. This is just a magic words approach, it seems to me.       Well, I -- I take it there is no argument over whether or not the expert is qualified.       The question is just whether his -- his theory makes any sense.       And the -- and the Petitioner says it doesn't.       Well, Mr. Barnett, I -- I can think of -- my initial reaction -- it has been an awful long time since I have been in the courtroom -- is -- is that that's whether or not this man is -- is qualified to give an opinion.       Step one.     The next thing is does this opinion make any sense?       That the court as the trier-of-fact chooses to -- that the -- not reserved to cases where there's a jury?     Is that --       It seems to me that, as I indicated before, that the whole question of weight and admissibility is somewhat less important when the trial judge is not the gatekeeper.     The trial judge, at the end of the day, can hear the testimony and say, you know, I admitted this testimony, but it doesn't make any sense, it doesn't work.       Well, he does what I said, but then he has 100 pages of findings.       No, I think that's where we disagree.     The judge has to make a determination that, in his view, the -- the class can be certified.       And that includes some factual inquiries as -- as to the damages alleged and the cause of the injury and whether or not there is a common -- whether or not there's a commonality.       Well, that's not -- I'll think about it, but that's not my understanding.     I thought the judge has to make a determination that, in the next case we are going to hear this morning, that the representation is material or it affects the market. The judge has to make that conclusion, make that finding.       Well, of course, there matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits stage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702, the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation. I can see a judge saying, well, now, this theory that you're using, this theory works, I think it's accepted in academia.     Then he hears all the testimony, and he says, It just doesn't work here.       I'm -- I'm not sure what I just described is not Daubert.
11-88 +++$+++        But the Chief Justice's question was why did Congress do that?     What were the reasons for that?
11-889 +++$+++        Just to be clear, in your view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property, take water from the main stem in Basin 5?       But my question was, can they take it from the main stem -       Is that the part that, under their allegation at least, is saline?       All right.     Is that the part that -       -- they are referring to -       -- when they say it's too saline?       Well, this is a -- a perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question. At least as I understood it, it's this, I want you to assume -- I know you don't agree with that -- I want you to assume that the Compact gives Texas a right to 25 percent of the -- of the excess - of the water above the cubic foot.       I want you to assume that. Now, wouldn't the Compact be meaningless if Texas couldn't actually reach that water?
11-8976 +++$+++        Isn't it essential to your argument that the very definition of a conspiracy is a crime that continues over time?       And I suppose that a conspiracy is defined by relation to its criminal objects, not to its membership.     If there's five people that conspired to rob a bank and one of the conspirators has said, I'm out of here, I withdraw from the conspiracy, metaphysically, you might argue, well, it's a new conspiracy because it's a new group. But there is no support of the law for that, I take it.       Because it's the criminal objects that define the conspiracy?       And I didn't hear you.       I was just -- I was curious.     In 1997, the Petitioner did report the identity of another cooperating witness to Gray.     You don't -- you don't rely on that as showing that he was, indeed, part of the conspiracy?     That's just irrelevant to your case?       Well, that was -- it was kind of a throwaway line.     But why isn't that dispositive for you?
11-9307 +++$+++        And is there any relief for him in the -- in the regulations of Bureau of Prisons or the government -- other than a pardon, I suppose, of defendants?       Eligible for?
11-9335 +++$+++        But you could say that with reference to the -- to the maximum.     Everything you said could be applied to the maximum, and Apprendi says you can't say that.
11-94 +++$+++        And that makes it clear to you that there's no overlap between property and liberty, so that no matter how much of your property are taken and what circumstances, it's just property; there's no liberty involved?       But you want -- want us to write as part of that decision that no matter how great the fine, liberty is not involved?       Liberty in the sense of what the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth amendment say.
11-9540 +++$+++ 
11-965 +++$+++        Well, I -- I understood the concession as being, that if Mercedes were the only corporation involved in this dispute, there would be specific -- sufficient contacts.     That -- that doesn't tell me anything about Daimler.       I'm -- I'm not so sure that this concession is that troublesome for Daimler.       So how does that answer the question about Daimler?       There has been one?       But I think their concession is quite consistent with the proposition that the distinction between parent and subsidiary is meaningful for jurisdictional purposes.     And that you're not just automatically an -- you, yourself, do not defend the Ninth Circuit's position that, if Daimler gives enough functions to Mercedes that it has to give, that then Daimler is -- is liable. You don't -- your footnote, I think page 35 of your brief, you -- you don't take the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to its full extent.
11-982 +++$+++        Is -- is -- is the Petitioner -- do you anticipate that the Petitioner will agree with you, that this covers future products?       But you have two categories.     You have current and previous, as to which the covenant runs to everything.     Then you have what you say is future, and that has to be a colorable imitation.       So it -- so it -- so it does cover some future designs.     And they're correct about that, and you're incorrect.       That's because it usually sues.     Page -- page 114 of the Joint Appendix says, "Your Honor, over the past eight months, Nike has cleared out the worst offending infringers.     Now, Already remains as one of the last few companies that was identified on that top ten list of infringers." I mean, that -- that's your company's policy.     That's your attorney, I take it.       Well, but that's because you gave them the covenant after you sued them.       They are on the top ten list of infringers. (Laughter.)       You -- you referred, just in a fleeting way, to the fact that they can go to the PTO and to the board?       What about my question, and I wasn't -- it was probably my fault --       -- I didn't quite understand the government's petition.     Is the standing burden any less after there is a -- an administrative adjudication and you go to court for judicial review?
11-9953 +++$+++        I -- I would like to get the structure of your argument.     You began to say there's three reasons.     I would just like to hear those three reasons, so that I can understand the framework for all these questions.       The three reasons that we should affirm.       Okay.     And the second?       Okay.     Thank you.
12-10 +++$+++        But let -- let me -- let me ask you this:     Suppose that you're a Congressman or a Congresswomen, and you are a constitutional expert, and you take your oath to uphold the Constitution very seriously. A funding bill comes before you.     You're the chairman of the committee, and you decide that you're going to fund A, rather than B, because you like their speech much better.     Is that a violation of the Constitution?       Because you like their policies much better?       Well, I'm -- I'm not quite sure I -- I see the difference, that the -- a conscientious Congressperson cannot -- can, in your view, say, I'm going to prefer organization A over organization B because I like their policies better --       -- across the board, with reference to drugs, with reference to guns, with reference to public health.       Let me -- let me just ask -- ask this one more time.     It seems -- because it seems to me that, when you get into the details of your answer, you indicate, oh, well, the government has lots of other criteria it could use, which seems to me just Page 46 an invitation to disguise what the government's real motive is. Suppose the government's interested in preventing and stopping the spread of malaria.     And there's an organization that's marvelous at delivering the proper message for this, but they criticize the United States often.     So they choose an organization that's not quite as good, but is quiet on these other issues. Is that permissible for the Congress to do?       Well, this isn't -- no. My concern was that your position was pretext.     Here, the Congress is right upfront.       And they say, the reason we're not giving to organization A is because it's always critical of the United States, even though its technical skills are better, we prefer organization B. Congress cannot do that?       And your best case for Page 47 that proposition is what?       Well, I'm -- I'm not sure they should if they're going to -- if they're going to be able to establish the principle that allows them to prevail in this case, and that's why I'm asking.
12-1036 +++$+++       Suppose it's a given that we all concede that the complaint is both for private-named persons and for restitution.    Both.    What result?      No, the rest of my hypothetical, part of the restitution goes to the State.      Where's the language?      I have 79.
12-1038 +++$+++    But that -- that was a First Amendment case and the -- and the problem there was that he was barred for a peaceful protest the first time around, and that's not -- that's not this case.   Well, that -- that's a First Amendment case. But let's concentrate first on -- on the argument you make under this statute. It seems to me that the statute should be construed according to normal rules of easements, and the owner of the subservient easement, the easement holder, cannot overburden that easement. It cannot -- I've got an easement on the back of my property for the utility company. They can't hold a picnic there. They can't do that.   That's overburdening the easement, and this is standard stuff. And it's right in the easement agreement with the City of Santa Barbara, that the police -- that the military commander can make reasonable regulations.   Now, you may -- you have a First Amendment argument. I understand that. But let's just concentrate on the property ownership.   You're back on the First Amendment case. It -- it may or may not. If the -- if the commander wants to close the base for a rocket launch, he certainly -- he certainly can. That's set forth in article -- or a condition of paragraph 4 of the easement.
12-10882 +++$+++    Well, let -- let me ask you this. Suppose that the American Psychiatric Association and -- and all other professional associations do use the SEM. Suppose that. It seems to me what the State is saying here in declining to use that, is that it declines to follow the standards that are set by the people that designed and administer and interpret the tests.   But it seems to me that, to follow from Justice Kagan's question, and I think this is a very important question, that we've been talking about here about the -- the inaccuracy, to some extent, of IQ scores, and your rule prevents us from getting a better understanding of whether that IQ score is -- is accurate or not because you -- we cannot even reach the adaptive functioning prong. You prevent it at the outset. And incidentally, you don't prevent it if it's under 65 -- under 70, do you?   But in very close cases, doesn't it illuminate whether or not the IQ test is exactly as reported or if it is subject to some decrease or increase depending on what the evidence of adaptive functioning shows.   Well, I'll read -- I'll read Atkins again.   But I thought Atkins did -- did refer to the adaptive functioning.   But that was even under DSM-IV, correct?   Please, I   Then I misunderstand the case. I thought the Florida court held, in effect, my words, that the IQ was a threshold in order to make this inquiry, and if you had 70 -- over 70, you could not make a showing. But please correct me if I'm wrong.   So you do not get -- if you do not satisfy prong one, you do not get to prongs two or three, period. Right?   But -- but, General --   The -- the last ten people Florida has executed have spent an average of 24.9 years on death row. Do you think that that is consistent with the purposes of the death penalty, and is -- is it consistent with sound administration of the justice system?   That wasn't my question.   Is it consistent with the -- with the purposes that the death penalty is designed to serve, and is it consistent with an orderly administration of justice?   Go ahead.   Well   Well   Well, let -- let -- let me ask -- ask this. Of course most of the delay is at the hands of the defendant. In this case it was 5 years before there was a hearing on the -- on the Atkins question. Has the attorney general of Florida suggested to the legislature any -- any measures, any provisions, any statutes, to expedite the consideration of these cases.
12-1117 +++$+++    What do you mean? He is going to the police station?   Well, objective reasonableness is a -- is at least a mixed issue of law and fact, and it seems to me Justice Scalia is correct. You -- you have the burden to show that this was a clearly established standard, and you say that at a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of reasonableness.   But I'm not clear how that works either. Suppose the police are very good shots, it doesn't hit the public, it just hits the assailant. Is it still unreasonable because it wasn't a public place? And does that mean that the fleeing felon is much better off if he goes to a public place?   I  I don't understand how -- how this bears on -- on the -- on the question of whether or not -- as to the reasonableness as to the driver.
12-1128 +++$+++       I don't -- I don't understand.    Suppose the licensee says:    This isn't covered by the agreement at all; we're not going to pay you anything.    And it starts to manufacture its products.    That's -- that's the whole point.    It's outside the agreement; they are not going to pay you anything.      Or am I missing something?      Well, there would have been infringement if you had refused to pay the royalty, and -- and if they had refused to pay the royalty and you were covered, then -- then there would have been infringement.      All right.    I understand.
12-1146 +++$+++    Are you reading subsection (3), the (A), (B) and (C), and you focus on (C) , any other applicable -- are you reading those in the alternative? I read that they -- that all three have to be complied with.   But then that doesn't help you, because you are right back to where you started. You have the tonnage per year reguirement.  And with the absurd result that follows.   What was that case?   Just to be clear, you're not saying -- or are you saying -- that if you're denied the authority you seek here, there can be no significant regulation of greenhouse gases under the Act? You are not saying that?   And you were going to get to 7475(3), (a), (b), (c) on that point.   I have to say in reading the brief for the States and reading your brief, I -- I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position. Brown & Williamson I think is distinguishable for the reasons set forth in the reply brief. And what are the cases you want me to cite if I write the opinion to sustain your position?
12-1163 +++$+++  
12-1168 +++$+++    Well, let -- let me ask this question: Assume it to be true that an elderly lady who was quite successful and had meaningful communication with over 100 women going into the clinic, before this law, was unable to talk to even one after this law. Assume that's true. Does that have any bearing on our analysis? And does that have any bearing on Justice Breyer's question about whether or not a law can be written to protect that kind of activity but still to prevent obstruction and blocking?   You say there's no -- no guarantee of talking quietly?   Do you want me to write an opinion and say there's no free speech right to quietly converse on an issue of public importance?   I still don't know where you're going to -- this -- this goes to Justice Breyer's question. You -- you cannot write an ordinance that says obstruction, intimidation, blocking is prohibited, and still allow the kind of conversation that I described earlier and that I want you to assume to be true for the -- for the purposes of this question.   But in speech cases, when you address one problem, you have a duty to protect speech that's -- that's -- that's lawful.   But I -- I think what you have to say to this Court is that it's impossible to write a statute of the kind that we are discussing now, and this is Justice Breyer's question.   But the consequence is just what is described by Justice Scalia; that is, the consequence of the statute. Are you saying that the consequences of what you write are irrelevant to this argument?   It seems to me that you should answer Justice Scalia's question, then.   It's very hard for me to credit the statement or the implication that for an employee to say, "We're glad you're here. You're going to be well taken care of. This is a safe facility. It's important for you to be here," it's very hard for me to credit your statement that that's incidental to their function.   Is your concern that, absent this statute, there will be physical obstruction to the entrance? Is that a major concern?   Let me ask, if that's if that's your concern, how many Federal prosecutions were brought in Massachusetts for physical obstruction under the Federal statute?   But the Federal interest that you're the defending is you don't want this physical obstruction statute to be misinterpreted.   But what's wrong with the physical obstruction statute as an answer to many of the problems that Massachusetts is facing?   That's obstruction under the Federal statute.   Justice Holmes said even a dog knows the difference in being stumbled over and being kicked.   Can't -- can't -- you're saying Federal prosecutions can't tell when people are deliberately obstructing --   -- this is beyond -- this is beyond the realm of the law?
12-1173 +++$+++ 
12-1182 +++$+++    But at least if you've adopted a SIP or proposed a SIP, you've given reasons, you have a -- you have a rational plan, and the EPA then must give a reasoned response to it; whereas, if the EPA is the first one, they're writing on a blank slate; and it seems to me that, in some respects, the EPA is more constrained under this process to which you object.   But you're -- you're saying that "significant" must mean only measurable amounts. It can't mean -- pick your word -- culpability, feasibility, responsibility, feasibility. One State finds it guite feasible, from a cost standpoint, to reduce emissions by a factor of 10. The other State is the -- Justice Breyer's example, finds that it can't do it, except if it's a factor of a hundred. Can't you say that the contribution in one case is more significant than the other, based on feasibility? Maybe you can't.   But the word -- the word "significantly" does import a judgmental component. I think that's what the government is going to say. I just wanted to ask you what --   Maybe they'll have a better answer.
12-1184 +++$+++    This is not your best 4 argument.   Well, baseless is at the end of the day -- I mean, you have a case that involves a straight stroke rail that at one end goes in an elliptical arc, and the district judge had to figure this out with all the experts. After he goes through all the underbrush, he finds there's nothing there. And it's hard to say that that's objectively baseless to a district judge who's spent weeks studying this thing. But at the end of the day, suppose he finds there's nothing there?
12-1200 +++$+++    Does that bear on the guestion whether this is appellate? Do you agree that this is appellate, once the district judge -- district court has the matter in front of it?   If there is a judgment in the bankruptcy court, you would concede there is an appeal to the district court?   Yes.
12-123 +++$+++        But then you just -- but then you just lose on the merits.     What the Ninth Circuit says, they can't even argue this.       I -- I thought that what we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional, it's a taking.     Your position is you can't say that.     I don't understand why.     Other than, if you want to talk about Williamson and so forth, we can get into that.       Suppose they do have standing.     Could they raise the claim?       You say no.       Let's assume they have standing.     Could they raise the claim --       -- that this is an unconstitutional taking?       No, no.     In the administrative proceeding where they are charged with -- where a penalty is being assessed against them.
12-126 +++$+++        Are bribed jurors not a miscarriage of justice?       A juror who's bribed, is there no -- no miscarriage of justice there?       But we're -- we're talking about the meaning of the term "miscarriage of justice." It seems to me there -- there are many serious errors that can be described by that general phrase.       Do you want to say it's a term of art?     Fine.
12-1281 +++$+++    Let me ask you this Suppose that we were to conclude that the history is simply too overwhelming to rule in your favor on the "happens" problem. Could we still use history to say that -- or overlook history to rule for you on the inter/intra-session point?   How do we do that?   Is it because of the 80 years or --   Well, the Constitution as it -- as it first was has now been amended and it is no longer a part of the Constitution, with reference to appointment of Senate, uses the word "vacancy" in much the same way as the clause we're discussing here, and I think favors your position, because if a vacancy happens by resignation during the recess of the legislature then the governor can make the appointment. And you certainly wouldn't think that that could happen over 3 days --   -- occur over -- I should say occur over 3 days.
12-1315 +++$+++    Can you tell us, in response to Justice Alito's second part of his question about the other cases -- you talked about the two Supreme Court cases. You said, if you read every Federal decision, since the beginning of time --   Assume -- assume we have an interest, just assume we do, in not having too many suits simply to protect your rights in -- in cases where the copyright may not be worth much or may not be well-established. Which rule, yours or the Petitioner's, is more helpful in this regard?   Could you finish answering my question?
12-133 +++$+++        No.     No.     It's saying that there's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes. It's called arbitration.     And arbitration does not necessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a practical matter involve the costs and the formalities of litigation.       Well, I mean maybe it is litigation if you need a $300,000 report.     But why do you need a $300,000 report?     That's what we're asking. And I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage in speculation about the limits of arbitration in order to resolve in your favor. Now, to be sure, they took a -- a more rigid view below, so we don't have much of a record.
12-135 +++$+++        Could they -- could they opt out?       But -- but how could -- how could they opt out if the arbitrator said -- says, as Justice Scalia and Justice Alito are suggesting, we have -- I have jurisdiction to decide this case.     I decide that there is a class action, all these people are in the class.       Well, let me ask -- ask you this question because I think it's consistent with the answer you're giving to the Chief Justice, a little bit different, though.     Suppose you have -- and this is a hypothetical case, this is not this case because I don't know the facts.     Suppose you have an attorney in a small town, well respected, doesn't have a great big practice, and he's chosen as the arbitrator. And if he arbitrates the one case, he's going to get a fee of, I don't know, $10,000.     He says -- you know, if this is a class arbitration, I can keep this going for 11 years, I will make a million dollars. Does he have the obligation to say, I'm going to decide the class action issue under this theory that is decided here, and after I do that, since I have a conflict, I'll bow out.     I'll just say, there is a class action, and then I will leave it for some other arbitrator.     Does he have that obligation?     And if he doesn't, should that bear on our decision here?       But -- but tell me why -- why is that a factor or not a factor in -- in our decision?     That should not be a factor in our decision?
12-1371 +++$+++ 
12-138 +++$+++    No, but the clerk's office is closed.   No, you can't -- no, you can't say that. You can't say that. There is no arbitration agreement under your -- it would still be for the court.   -- well, you have to -- you have to go first to the court because that's what the arbitration mechanism provides, but there's no arbitration mechanism.

12-142 +++$+++        Do you want me to write down in this case, from my understanding, that under New Hampshire law, strict liability is determined quite without reference to the adequacy of warning?       Now wait.     What's -- what's a factor?     The warning is or is not a factor?       Well, but that's -- that's not the thrust of your argument.     And I think it was a factor here for some of the reasons Justice Kagan has suggested.       I mean, which does -- was the warning relevant or not relevant to the determination of strict liability?       I'm talking about the definition of the duty.     Was it permissible for the jury to define the duty here and the breach of the duty in part by -- by reference to the adequacy of the warning? And I -- I now understand your answer to be yes.
12-144 +++$+++        But this is not whoever it wants.     These are five proponents of -- of the measure and if we were to accept your argument, it would give the State a one-way ratchet.     The State could go in and make a defense, maybe a half-hearted defense of the statute, and -- and then when the statute is held invalid, simply -- simply leave.     On the other hand, if -- if the State loses, the State can appeal. So this is a one-way ratchet as it favors the State and allows governors and other constitutional officers in different States to thwart the initiative process.       That's really -- that's a broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the Court wants to reach it.     The rationale of the Ninth Circuit was much more narrow.     It basically said that California, which has been more generous, more open to protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being penalized for not going far enough. That's a very odd rationale on which to sustain this opinion.       But you're -- you're doing so in a -- in a case where the opinion is very narrow. Basically that once the State goes halfway, it has to go all the way or 70 percent of the way, and you're doing so in a case where there's a substantial question on - on standing.     I just wonder if -- if the case was properly granted.       But that's not the issue the Ninth Circuit decided.       It was hundreds of years old in the common law countries.     This was new to the United States.       So -- so that's not accurate.
12-1493 +++$+++    As to whether or not there was a sale, suppose the facts in this case, it was a Glock, I think --   -- was -- was delivered, and suddenly the -- Abramski finds that it's a valuable collector's item. There were only two or three of these made, had a special trigger or something, and it's now immensely valuable. Could the uncle insist that it be sold to him for the $700, or for the -- for the agreed price? The $400 thing?   Well, if it isn't -- if it isn't, then there wasn't -- then there -- there was a subsequent sale.   Well, I'm asking about that.
12-158 +++$+++       It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.    But let's leave that. (Laughter.)      But you did not give the line to the Chief Justice's question where there was a treaty that intruded on the Federal structure.    You can have a treaty where the President is required to set aside any State law that in his view contravenes a national interest.    That's a structure problem. You've -- you've given us no -- no principle the other way.      Well, is it your precept, then, that a treaty cannot be inconsistent with our constitutional structure?
12-167 +++$+++        I -- I don't want to interrupt your opening because I think -- I just didn't hear your first -- "by foregoing"?       By foregoing.       I don't know when it can happen because there's no colloquy when there's a guilty plea.     The colloquy happens when there's a not guilty plea.       No, no -- you're correct. You're correct.
12-17 +++$+++       Are you -- are you telling us that there is simply no commercial consequences to this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of no commercial value, in any instance?      Well, you were the one with summary judgment.    Now, maybe -- maybe they didn't come forward with the information, but we interpret summary judgment in favor of -- of the losing party. And you're -- so you say you are totally agnostic.    I am concerned that you are preventing them, by the summary judgment, from showing that there -- even with Virginians, there is a commercial value frequently to this information.      It's not just political.       Let's talk about -- let's talk about the Commerce Clause.    You are saying you are agnostic.    You have no idea whether or not there might be some commercial value to this information.    I would think, as an officer of the State of Virginia or as a matter of judicial notice, we could -- we could take notice that there is.      Of course, that assumes the question as to whether or not there is a general commercial interest in these -- in these -- in these documents.    And you say, oh, you are agnostic.    At least that means you are open to the possibility that there might be a commercial interest. (Laughter.)       But Pike is not relevant here.    Pike involves -- the Southern Pacific v. Arizona the -- where there were -- where there were melons - where there were melons, and Arizona wanted to make sure that you had labels and packing of the melons in Arizona.     That was -- that was discriminatory against - against interstate -- against interstate commerce. That's not -- that's not dormant Commerce Clause, but that is discrimination, and there is discrimination here.      You -- you could say the same thing, we don't discriminate against Californians who want to come and pack their melons in Arizona.      It -- it would surprise me if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting a large plant in Virginia, had absolutely no interest in Virginia's tax policies.
12-207 +++$+++        He was held -- he was held with probable cause --       -- and his -- and his custody was restrained.     He was in a police station.       Were handcuffs put on him during the transport process?     Do you know?       But they -- they could -- they could have been?       So his liberties were constrained in all of those respects.     He would have to take off most of his clothes, subject to a patdown search?       They could look -- they could look in his -- in his briefcase?       I think -- I think there is some merit to your argument in that regard.     In Samson, he was a parolee, and he actually, as I recall, signed a -- a consent form as part of the probation.       A person -- a person has been arrested for a felony and is in custody, do the police -- does the justice system have an interest in knowing whether that person committed other crimes?       My question is whether or not the police, who have John Doe in custody for a felony, have an interest in knowing, at the outset or within a few weeks' time, whether or not that person has committed other crimes?       But they also have a reason for keeping him in custody.       And my -- my question is, do they have an interest -- a legitimate interest in knowing if that person has committed other crimes?       But we are also talking about identity.     I assume that, in Maryland and in a number of States, the time between release on bail and return for trial is more than four months. And, if it's found, as an identity matter, that this person has a criminal record or that they are -- suspected of serious crimes, that is a mandatory ground for reconsideration of bail.     And you say there is no interest in that.       Does a felon who's been arrested have a reduced expectation of privacy at the time of arrest?       Does a felon -- does a person who has been arrested for a felony have a reduced expectation of privacy at the time of his arrest?
12-236 +++$+++        But the very fact that it's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very careful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to deter the filing of stale claims.     And your -- your rule certainly undermines that.       It does seem to me, I did not have the opportunity to ask the government this question, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts the government's position that no petition may be filed, as being an absolute.     Because we all know, I take it the government concedes, that there is equitable tolling.       Or there can be equitable tolling in some cases.       You were going to address the shadow trial?       Procedural grounds because the affidavits aren't sufficient or --       Are there regulations or rules establishing hourly rates?
12-246 +++$+++        Well, but, in Berghuis, we found no implication.       So -- so Justice Kagan's question stands.       Well, a few, as I recall.       Well, what is your answer to Justice Kagan's earlier question to -- of the hypothetical of the defendant that says nothing for 20 questions?       Then there's no -- and there's no Miranda warning and no custody.
12-25 +++$+++        I want -- I want to interrupt just -- just one moment.     I may have misheard, or you may have misspoke.     I thought you said that no requests were sent until the suit was filed, but the request was -- the first FOIA request was June 23rd, 2005; the second FOIA request was August 24, 2006; and this Herron suit was filed August 29, 2006.       So letters were sent before the suit was filed.       But the -- yes, but the FOIA suit was made before the suit was filed.       But in anticipation of litigation does come after service of process, and an additional way to harmonize this statute with (12) is to say that, after the suit has been filed, then -- in anticipation of the litigation that that suit will engender, then you may get the information.     But you didn't do that.       That's the way the statute's written.       Well, that's because -- that's because the State is allowing solicitation, and it puts certain conditions on what your solicitation --       You point to page 94, you say, oh, it's just the last line, the whole thrust of the letter was solicitation.     You have to be fair about that.       You have to be fair about that.
12-3 +++$+++       That was fraud under 1343?      Well, was that what the fraud was in this -      But the language did talk about Arthur Andersen and Enron.
12-307 +++$+++        But then why does he enforce the statute?       But let me ask you, suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts about the practice of the President signing a bill, but saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do you call it, signing statements or something like that. It seems to me that if we adopt your position that that would ratify and confirm and encourage that questionable practice because if the President thinks the law is unconstitutional he shouldn't sign it, according to some views.     And that's a lot like what you're arguing here. It's very troubling.       You think Congress can use its powers to supercede the traditional authority and prerogative of the States to regulate marriage in all respects?     Congress could have a uniform definition of marriage that includes age, consanguinity, et cetera, et cetera?       Well, but then there is a federalism interest at stake here.     And I thought you told the Chief Justice there was not.       But you're -- you are insisting that we get to a very fundamental question about equal protection, but we don't do that unless we assume that the law is valid otherwise to begin with.    And we are asking is it valid otherwise.    Is -- what is the Federal interest in enacting this statute and is it a valid Federal interest assuming -- before we get to the equal protection analysis?
12-315 +++$+++    So suppose I'm the trial judge and I conclude that, if Air Wisconsin had said to the TSA, along the lines of Justice Scalia's earlier guestion, We have an employee who was terminated today, he probably knew it, he lost his temper during a test, he might think that some of our employees are out to get him, and there may even be some truth to that, he's authorized to carry a gun, we don't know if he has one or not, we're giving you that information. Suppose I'm the trial judge. I conclude that, if that information had been given to TSA, TSA guite properly stopped this plane to examine the pilot. Do I send the case to the jury?   Well, the Masson reporter for The New Yorker Magazine spent months on this article. They had proofreaders. They had editors in New York. And you're saying the same standard applies to the baggage handler who has only 10 minutes to decide what he's going to say?   So in my -- under my guestion, I first asked you, I'm the trial judge, I have made the determination that TSA would have acted the same way. I still have to submit this to the jury?   No, I thought that, even if the facts had been reported much more accurately than they were, that the TSA still had a duty to investigate.   Can't I make that determination as a matter of law?   Well, I think you're right. They seem to rely mostly on the proposition that this all should have been submitted to the judge.   Well, just pursuing Justice Alito's point about the other statement, the other, that he was terminated today. Well, he didn't get notice. I mean, that -- that's --   And then the final thing, I guess, was the same thing Justice Scalia had in mind, was that he's unstable.   So you want us to say the call has to be made right away, without reflection, without talking to supervisors, without some guiet discussion first? That's what you want us to put in the opinion?
12-357 +++$+++        Just to add to Justice Breyer's question, it's -- suppose the secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with typing the letter "I do not recommend" and they bribe her and she says "I recommend."     She has an interest in her integrity to give an honest transcription.     Under your view, and this is what Justice Breyer is getting at, I think, that -- that secretary has property that you are taking.     That's very far-reaching.       It -- it does seem to me important that you can't give us a common law case because common law is extortion -- at common law is extortion, it's usually the other way around.     It's usually the official who's doing the extorting.       At -- at common law, could anyone ever extort an official, or we just don't have those cases?
12-398 +++$+++        But when you -- when you isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals that make it a probe.       So it seemed to me your - your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well, it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer. Neither can the isolate without some additions.       Now, if it's -- if it's the process or the additions that make it patentable, fine.     But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point of Justice Kagan's question.       Well, we could have said that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the patent was that we have a uniform rule for all industries.       And -- and that avoids giving special industries special subsidies, which is very important it seems to me. Let me ask you this, and it's consistent with my -- my preface.     If we were to accept the government's position that the DNA is not patentable but the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient protection for innovation and research?     And if not, why not?
12-399 +++$+++        And do you -- you want us to write the case as if this is just a standard best interest determination and -- and this federal statute is irrelevant?     I don't understand your argument.       Well, these -- these considerations are why domestic relations pose the hardest problems for judges.     Our domestic relations judges all by themselves every day have these difficult problems.     If we could appoint King Solomon, who was the first domestic relations judge, as special master, we could do it.     But we can't do it.       But is -- is that true under South Carolina law?       Under South Carolina law in this adoption proceeding, the -- if it had not been for the statute, the best interest of the child standard would not have applied?       But -- but -- did you - at your -- when you began, do you use "paternity" in the biological sense?       As -- as you -- as you interpret the statute, "paternity is the biological sense," not -- not an -       -- not an existing parental relationship.
12-414 +++$+++        But just -- just to be clear, isn't that after Titlow had asked for an attorney because Titlow had talked with the jailer, who encouraged Titlow to plead innocent?     So -- so you have to include that preface to this statement, or it's quite incomplete.       Or correct me if that's wrong.
12-416 +++$+++        Would it -- would it help if you were -- were thinking about rules and caps, to consider not what the branded company would have -- would have made, but what the generic company would have lost?     And -- and use the latter as the limit?       Well, you -- you have to make an extrapolation, yes.       Well, if the generic wins, though, its -- everybody's profits are lower.     And you can gear it to just what the -- what the generic would have made.       What -- what do we look at to verify what you say?     Is that -- is that all in the briefs?       Because I had thought, as Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the 180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors, to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et cetera, and that that's a big advantage.       And now, you're -- now, you're indicating that it isn't.       Well, suppose -- suppose that hypothetical is correct.     That's what was my concern, too.     What the brand company can lose is much greater than what the generic can make.     So why don't you just put a cap on what the generic can make and then we won't have a real concern with the restraint of trade, or we'll have a lesser concern.     I think that's the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my concern as well.       Well, but it's not hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the brand companies profits are going to go way, way down right away and generic profits are not going to be that great.       Well, but so then the question still holds.     If you -- if you key your payment to what the brand company will make, it's just a much higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable restraint.       Okay, I will grant you that point that the 180 days is not that big a difference, and that there are many generics out there. But isn't that true in every industry?     You said at the outset, oh, well, now in the drug industry there are a lot of people ready to pounce in.     Isn't that true in any industry?       I think it's correct that to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers. And you then need marketers because the cost of these drugs can be hundreds of millions.     Is there anything in the record that shows the development cost of this drug?       It can be a billion.       Anything in this case?       Anything in the record?
12-417 +++$+++ 
12-418 +++$+++ 
12-43 +++$+++ 
12-462 +++$+++ 
12-464 +++$+++        Is that how they interpret weight of the evidence at this -- the Bail Reform Act says that the trial judge must determine weight of the evidence.     And in practice, and perhaps in reported decisions in the circuit, do the courts say we don't need to talk about weight of the evidence once there's a grand jury indictment -       -- end of inquiry?       I'm asking, perhaps not too clearly, I'm asking what function, what weight, what relevance do courts give in day-to-day hearings on detention to the Bail Reform Act requirement that judges must determine, as part of the bail determination, the weight of the evidence?       But -- but that's two different things.     Is the only thing the judge considers the risk of flight?       So then don't talk about risk of flight.     What weight does the judge give in determining whether or not the charges have merit to the Bail Reform Act's direction that he must determine the weight of the evidence?       I understand that.       But the court must determine that under the Bail Reform Act.       No -       Do you concede that there must be a traceability hearing?       I mean, in the general run case, so you agree that due process does require a traceability hearing?       And the defendants have the burden of proof in that hearing?       What is your view as to what the Constitution requires in that respect?       Mr. Dreeben, one other question.     It's the question I asked before.     I still don't understand.     Under the Bail Reform Act, the issue is pretrial detention.     The defendant says, Your Honor, under the Bail Reform Act, you must determine the weight of the evidence, and this is a skimpy case.     The judge says, the grand jury is all I need as probable cause. Can and do judges say that?     Does that suffice to comply with the statute?       Well, if it's required anyway, then certainly the due process argument that you make is much less weighty.     If we have to go through this anyway for detention, why not do it for distraint of property?
12-484 +++$+++        Do -- do you agree with the government's position that the limited affirmative defense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say, limited damages when there's multiple or mixed motives, would also apply to retaliation cases?       But I thought -- I thought the thrust of Justice Alito's question was that retaliation claims are -- are now quite common, and they can almost be used as a defensive -- as a defense when you know you are about to be hired.     And, if that's true, shouldn't we be very careful about the causation standard?       And so -- so that -- that was the thrust of -- of his question.       Well, but under -- under that analysis, you don't need the final clause on page a of your brief of 3, "because he has opposed."     Race is enough.
12-515 +++$+++    I thought the statute says that there is Federal court jurisdiction over any cause of action initiated by a State or Indian tribe to enjoin gaming activity that is conducted in violation of the compact.   Why couldn't this --   And you don't think that 1166 abrogates the immunity, which provides that, for purposes of Federal law, all State laws are applicable?   And you do not take the position that this casino in this case is part of a compact?   The casino in this case, in your view, is not subject to any -- is not covered by any compact?   But, if the tribe takes such an obscure position -- such a changing position, as to whether or not we are dealing with Federal lands here -- or pardon me, with Indian land, maybe that's a reason that we should confine and limit Kiowa so that it doesn't apply to Indian gaming, and we won't have this problem.   Because I wanted to get the answer to Justice Breyer's question, is it your position that these are Indian lands? And I still don't understand your position.   And if that's true, then maybe this whole idea of immunity doesn't work very well in the context of gaming.
12-5196 +++$+++    That's hard to enforce. Every lawyer's case is an exceptional case. That's just the way it works.   I recognize the problem that if you have sanctions, that he can't pay the sanctions and you're right back where you started. But are there cases in which there are sanctions imposed of an amount such as $75,000, $100,000?
12-52 +++$+++  
12-536 +++$+++        And I have the same question.     You have two -- two persons.     One person gives an amount to a candidate that's limited.     The other takes out ads, uncoordinated, just all on his own, costing $500,000. Don't you think that second person has more access to the candidate who's -- when the candidate is successful, than the first?     I think that was at the root of Justice Scalia's question and Justice Breyer's.       Okay.     But so your answer to the questions that have been put previously from - from me and Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia is that's the law?       I mean, that's -- just to be fair, that's -- I'm -- I'm coming -- I'm coming off the bench -       -- with the understanding that your answer is Buckley has settled that issue; no more discussion necessary?
12-547 +++$+++        Well, I'm -- I'm a little surprised at your answer, and Justice Scalia's question indicates the same.     If the law was as well settled as you say it was in the appellate courts, then it seems to me, certainly, counsel should raise it and is arguably deficient for not doing so.     Whether or not he'll prevail at the end of the day is something quite different.       If you -- if you prevail here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme courts.     State supreme courts, much like us, they wait until courts of appeals have issued their opinions. They wait to see how the practical application of those works, insofar as of the fairness of the trial.     They wait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then they -- and then they take the case. If you prevail, State supreme courts are -- are going to say -- you know, if we don't take this case, even if though it's -- does not present the issue as clearly as some late case might, we don't rush in, then we're going to be foreclosed.     I think you're proposing a dynamic which makes the Federal courts intrude on the way in which State courts choose to develop their law.
12-562 +++$+++        Well, are there cases in which the partnership is liable for a penalty?       I mean, I understand it's all passed through and so forth, But suppose the partnership does something that's a sham, that's a fraud, and then -- and -- and files a partnership information return with that -- with that information, but then the partners find out, either because of a ruling of the court that it's void or because they have second thoughts that they're not going to do that, so they change their individual -- they change their - their own tax return. Could there be any penalty against the partnership in that instance?       Would there be any penalty against the partners in that instance that I put?       Would there be criminal liability for filing a false information return?       But then -- then that - that just fortifies the point that Justice Scalia made, that the applicability of the penalty, it's -- it's always going to relate to the partners.
12-574 +++$+++ 
12-609 +++$+++        Well, we're going -- we're going right back -- the defense expert here peered into his mind.     It's set out in the appendix.     It's confusing because there's a doctor evidence and also an attorney evidence.       But the -- the expert is Dr. Evans.     He peers into the defendant's mind. Now, are -- is this case any different and any better for you because it happened in State court? Suppose everything here happened in the Federal court, would you have a constitutional objection?       And that constitutional objection would be?       So in your view -- in your view, the defendant can be interviewed by his own psychiatrist, but not by a prosecution psychiatrist?       Can you give me the -- can you give me the black letter formulation that you are asking this Court to adopt?     It violates the Fifth Amendment when?       Well, that's something of an overstatement because he also had the psychiatrist who testified that, in his expert opinion, he did not have the requisite mental state, and he -- and he prefaced that by indicating how many people he had examined that had used meth and there was neurotoxicity, so this defense expert did testify to that.       So I think you quite overstate when you say the fact the defendant testified.
12-62 +++$+++        But when -- when it comes to the court of appeals, that's different.     The court of appeals begins with a framework of whether or not it's within the guidelines.     That's how it begins to measure the exercise of discretion.       Yes, I agree with Justice Ginsburg's follow-up question.     It seems to me you avoided the question.     You said, oh, well, the judge looked at all this and selected the sentence he did. But he did so because he referred to the later guidelines, and I think that you have to recognize that. Unless -- unless I'm --       Well, I'd like to finish. Unless I am wrong under the record.       Well, but that -- that gets back to -- to your argument.     You're -- I sense that you want me to leave the bench saying the guidelines just don't make any difference.     Suppose the -- suppose the district judge said, you know, if it were just up to me, I would give this lower sentence, but the guidelines are an important institutional part of our system. Uniformity in sentencing is desirable.     For us to take into account the experience of other -- of other courts and what the Sentencing Commission does is very important.     Therefore, my discretion is guided by these guidelines.       You don't want me -- you don't want me to say that.       But your -- your statement to me was -- and to us earlier -- was that the -- there is no legal constraint on the exercise of discretion. agree, the judge -- everybody knows the judge can go lower, but that overlooks the fact that discretion is defined by legal standards.     That's how we begin to think about discretion. That's how appellate courts weigh I discretion.     And, again, you want to give the guidelines no effect in determining how that discretion is shaped, guided and exercised.       Would you accept the fact that they define the discretion, even though they don't constrain it?
12-682 +++$+++        Well, there are two things.     Number one is it delegated to the faculty.     And number two, they're election -- they're elected only rarely and in staggered terms.       Well, I'm not sure I understood the answer you gave to the Chief Justice's hypothetical.     Maybe I misunderstood the hypothetical. Suppose the board of regents have a rule, it's written, it's a rule, that the faculty makes a determination on whether there should be affirmative action.       Five -- and the faculty votes for affirmative action.     Three years later, the board of trustees said we're abolishing the rule, we're doing that ourselves.     Violation?       So the -- so the regents can take it away from the faculty?       But can the legislature take it away from the regents?       No, no.     Hypothetical case.       But then the voters can't take it away.     At what point is it that your objection takes force?     I just don't understand -- I just don't understand -       -- the declension here -       Or the crescendo, whatever you call it. (Laughter.)       That applies in the Chief Justice's hypothetical or my revision of it as between the board of regents and the faculty, or between the faculty and the legislature.       Why is -- why is the faculty administration, a faculty decision, any less outcome determinative than what the voters would say? I -- I think there would be people that might disagree with your empirical assumption.       But I still don't understand your answer to Justice Alito's question. Suppose the dean has authority in the bylaws of the university to reverse what the faculty does, but you have a dean who just does not like affirmative action. He is dead against it.     And he makes the decision to reverse the faculty.     Do you have a remedy?       All right.     Then you have Justice Alito's question.     Then it's the president of the university, and then it's the legislature.
12-696 +++$+++       And if I'm -- if I'm that official and I think a prayer was over the top for being proselytizing and particularly sectarian, I would say I rather not -- you not come back next week; I am going to look for somebody else?      Well, so in other words the government is now editing the content of prayers?      Well, I just want to make sure what your position -- your position is that town councils like Greece can have prayers if they are non-provocative, modest, decent, quiet, non-proselytizing.    That's your position?      It just seems to me that enforcing that standard and the standard I suggested involves the State very heavily in the censorship and - and the approval or disapproval of prayers.      That may play ultimately in your position if we say that that's why there shouldn't be any prayer at all.    But then you have the problem mentioned by Justice Scalia that we are misrepresenting who we really are.      I mean, I'm serious about this.    This involves government very heavily in religion.      In a way it sounds quite elitist to say, well, now, we can do this in Washington and Sacramento and Austin, Texas, but you people up there in Greece can't do that.
12-71 +++$+++        The Court of Appeals said that there's a different preemption test under -- for this law under this Constitutional provision than there is under the Supremacy Clause.     It seems to me that that ignores the proposition that the State has a very strong and vital interest in the integrity of its elections, even when those, and perhaps especially when those are elections of Federal officials.     And it seems to me the Ninth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight to that interest.
12-729 +++$+++        It's fair to say, in other words, that it's typical in the insurance industry that statute of limitations run from proof of loss?       From occurrence? Occurrence -
12-751 +++$+++    Suppose you were a legislature or a congressman. You are absolutely committed to the idea that it's important and salutary to have employees own stock in the company for which they work. How would you write the statute?   Well, once you say the trustee doesn't have the duty to diversify, it seems to me you are living in something of a different world.   I just don't see what the trustee is supposed to do. You have the company stock. By comparing it with other stocks, there will be many investments that are just as good or better. When does he have to make the investment, in other words, just as good or better? I don't understand. I don't understand what -- how we're going to implement what Congress wanted to implement.   But your -- your argument, at least according to the Petitioners's brief, and I think they're correct, you go away from the purity standard. You have your own standard whether or not it's materially overvalued in this instance. Or are you saying --   But -- but then -- but then you are creating a special standard which is just what you're accusing the Petitioners of doing.   The Chief Justice indicated I can ask just one guestion. Is this a case in which we must decide what the fiduciary standard is guite without regard to inside information? Is inside information just an added issue in the case or is it the key issue in the case?
12-7515 +++$+++       So then you -- you're saying that the government's position is that contributing factor should be a substantial contributing factor; you're happy with that.      What result if a heroin dealer persuades a first time user to please try heroin, it's wonderful.    He does.    Three days later the addict, the new addict, the new user buys heroin from a different dealer and overdoses and dies?    Does the first dealer contribute, is a substantial contributing cause?      No, no.    The heroin has disappeared, but he has become addicted.
12-761 +++$+++    Is it part of Coke's narrow position that national uniformity consists in labels that cheat the consumers like this one did?   I think it's important for us to know how the statutes work. And if the statute works in the way you say it does and that Coca-Cola stands behind this label as being fair to consumers, then I think you have a very difficult case to make. I think it's relevant for us to ask whether people are cheated in buying this product. Because Coca-Cola's position is to say even if they are, there's nothing we can do about it. Do you still have this -- do you still have this label?   But you say that even I -- I take it I'm characterizing your position right. You say that even if there's a violation of the FDA regulations, they still couldn't sue under the Lanham Act because that's for the FDA.   I thought that was -- I thought that was at Page 39 in your brief in a footnote.   Well, the Lanham -- the Lanham Act applies nationally.   So you're -- you used a state preemption and then say we should apply the same principles to two federal statutes --   -- but that's a quite different point.   You want us to -- you want us to write an opinion that said that Congress enacted a statutory scheme because it intended that no matter how misleading or how deceptive a label it is, if it passes the FDA, it cannot -- it -- there can be no liability. That's what you want us to say?   Don't make me feel bad because I thought that this was pomegranate juice. (Laughter.)   But the point is that it is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police food and beverage labeling. I think that was the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's question. I had the same concern. And this is relevant because we want to see what the likely intention of Congress was with reference to these two statutes.
12-7822 +++$+++       I think the property law cases that you cite, pages 24-25 of your brief, I had thought originally that this would be the principal focus of our decisions in these cases, but it's -- it's marginally in your favor.    It's not really very strong. I mean, you have an 1839 North Carolina case and the CJS case.    There's just not a lot of help in property law.
12-786 +++$+++    Well, under your submission in a process patent, if the consumer adds the final step, vast numbers of consumers, and let's assume they have noticed -- they've been notified that they can't do this, then there's liability.   Yet, until we issue the case in your favor.   Well, if you don't prevail on your indirect infringement claim, can you relitigate the direct infringement case in the -- before the En Banc Court, or --
12-79 +++$+++        What -- what is your position if the broker says, give me $100,000, and I will buy covered securities, and then he just pockets it and -- and flees?       Well, I don't see how this case is that much different.     They say, we were going to invest in CDs, and the CDs will be backed by purchase of the securities that we will purchase for you.       I mean, that's exactly what I would like you to think about for a second because the last words of Ms. Goldenberg of the SEC, well, if you win, it's going to seriously hamper the SEC in combatting fraud. Of course, it wouldn't in a case like this, because they aren't limited by covered securities, they can deal with any security, and they did bring a case here.     But they're worried about what you say, that somehow this will narrow their authority, and they quote Line, which is debatable. But assuming that it's debatable, Mr. - Mr. Clement will have a chance to answer this exact question.     And so you are saying there are none.     And Line is debatable.     And, therefore, it would not have hampered them in any case in the past, nor any one we're likely to think of in the future, but for Line, which is somebody's decision over at the SEC, and can be argued that it fits within your definition. Is that really your answer?     Or are we going to discover Mr. Clement coming up and saying, you forgot about da, da, da, da, da?
12-794 +++$+++    But that still doesn't answer Justice Alito's dilemma. You say he can't be penalized for doing nothing, but the juror in Justice Alito's hypothetical says, what am I supposed to do when he didn't present anything, and I'm concerned about that? I don't think you've answered the question.   Suppose we read Estelle as saying that, on the issue of remorse, it is an open question whether or not the self-incrimination privilege is applicable. Suppose we read it that way. And suppose we think that, in your case, remorse was an issue at the penalty phase. Does that not mean that this issue was not clearly decided? That's -- it has a bearing on this case?   Suppose we read Mitchell as saying that on the -- where remorse is at issue, it is not settled whether or not there is a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination right; and it is not settled that the defendant is entitled to an instruction about silence, number one. Number two, suppose we think, as I think to be the case, that remorse was an issue in this trial in the penalty phase. Does that not mean that the rule is unclear and you're not clearly entitled to an instruction on that issue?   But your -- your answer is what the law should be. My question is whether or not at least the law is not open on that point, unsettled.
12-815 +++$+++ 
12-820 +++$+++    In many cases, this would be an example. The cost of experts to testify about the child's adoption or adaption or settlement in New York would be very substantial. The experts who had examined the child, the experts who knew about the school, the school's officials themselves, would all have to go to England to testify. Is that a factor that the courts consider, or is that not -- not relevant?   In other words, "settlement" is a code word for saying ease of producing witnesses?   What's -- what's the -- an example of where a settled child might be returned? A very -- two very good parents, and the child is very adaptable, and so the child can -- is well settled now, but the child will be well settled in the new environment at well. Is that the -- is that the hypothetical?   How -- how separate are the two concepts of the best interest of the child and the interest in policing parents, so they don't abduct? At what point do they intersect?   The child settled, that's when the abduction took place.   You said it started that a settled child should be returned?   Yes, abducted.
12-842 +++$+++    No, no, no. But assume the validity of the question. Does it -- why is it that your position applies to military assets if that is -- that is beyond the scope of the Court's power here, but on the assumption of Justice Scalia's question it's within, and of your hypothetical, that it's subject to execution in France?   Well, in making the rule, we're asking whether or not our rule should take account of this concern. And you say, well, it's up to the district court. We're going to tell the district court what to do. So what do we say on this point?   Does the waiver extend to military property?   Well, then the waiver just restates the immunity that's provided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.   How does it go beyond that?   But not as to military property. So how do I know how far the waiver extends?   I'm asking whether or not the waiver extends to Argentine military property.   Does it waive immunity as to a consular residence or an embassy building?
12-8561 +++$+++    So -- so Congress assumed that this defendant could be liable, in part, for other people's crimes?   A single law or loss?   And is that another way of saying as a result of this defendant's offense?
12-872 +++$+++        Would there be any unfairness to the parties if this case were remanded to the court of appeals with instructions for it in turn to remand to the district court to see whether or not the GERA issue has been properly presented or waived and to consider that?     Would there be -       -- any unfairness to the parties in doing that?       That argument -- that argument could be made in the district court.
12-873 +++$+++    Am I correct that no circuit has adopted the zone of interest test in the context of the Lanham Act?
12-895 +++$+++       But this instruction at J196 says that the defendant "knew his cohort used a firearm."    It really should say that "knew his cohort would carry a firearm."      Because as I -- when I read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts, a jury might think that there's liability if he knew that a firearm was used, which is a very odd interpretation, but that's -- the instruction lends itself to that interpretation.      But do you agree that, taken by itself, that one could be read that way?      I said taken by itself.      Yes.      Look at his -- look at his instruction and think about the bank robbery hypothetical with the driver of the car.    His number 2 is that they intentionally took some action to facilitate or encourage the use of the firearm.    I think that would be an okay instruction in the bank robbery hypothetical.      He drove the car. Principal object was to rob the bank, not to use the firearm, but he facilitated the use of a firearm.    I can see that a judge could give that instruction.      And -- and you agree that for aiding and abetting, you must -- the gun offense, you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by the cohort.      You agree with that.      Would you agree that in order to show aiding and abetting -- and I'll just quote from a California case here -- that, "The aider and abetter has to have knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and the intent to facilitate it"?      Would you -- would you agree that the statement -- that the first part of the instruction that the district court gave, "defendant knew his cohort used a firearm," is inaccurate?    Is incomplete?      Potentially misleading?
12-9012 +++$+++    Do you agree that the victim, in this case the bank, may not hold on to the property for an unreasonable period of time?
12-929 +++$+++ 
12-930 +++$+++    Under your view, does automatic conversion cover someone who has to file a new petition?   So the way this works, you don't have to file a new petition?   Suppose -- suppose everybody knows that, for the group that's covered by the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the nephews, that there's going to be a 3 or 4-year wait. Doesn't a new petition have to be filed, so that BIA knows that this person's in line?
12-9490 +++$+++    Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but my recollection of Hensley is, you're right, the police department 1 notifies police department 2. But a premise of the case, I had thought, was that police department 1 had reasonable suspicion.   I understand that.   Could you explain to me one more time why it's relevant that there were these details that it was a particular kind of crime, that it was silver, the license plate, that's this case. Suppose in another case, a car just ran me off the road, and it's the only -- the only car that's on Highway 1 between Fort Bragg and the state park.   And incidentally -- it doesn't have much to do with the case -- is this a two -- a two-lane road?   That's what I thought.
12-96 +++$+++        This reverse engineering that you seem so proud of, it seems to me that that obscures the -- the real purpose of -- of the statute. And if Congress is going to single out separate States by name, it should do it by name.     If not, it should use criteria that are relevant to the existing -- and Congress just didn't have the time or the energy to do this; it just reenacted it.       Well, the Marshall Plan was very good, too, the Morrill Act, the Northwest Ordinance, but times change.       Well, I -- I do think the evidence is very clear that Section -- that individual suits under Section 2 type litigation were just insufficient and that Section 5 was utterly necessary in .     No doubt about that.       But with -- with a modern understanding of -- of the dangers of polling place changes, with prospective injunctions, with preliminary injunctions, it's not clear -- and -- and with the fact that the government itself can commence these suits, it's not clear to me that there's that much difference in a Section 2 suit now and preclearance.     I may be wrong about that.     I don't have statistics for it. That's why we're asking.   Can you tell us how many attorneys and how many staff in the Justice Department are involved in the preclearance process?     Is it 5 or ?       Well, what does that mean?       Do you think the preclearance device could be enacted for the entire United States?       And that is because that there is a federalism interest in each State being responsible to ensure that it has a political system that acts in a democratic and a civil and a decent and a proper and a constitutional way.       But if -- if Alabama wants to have monuments to the heros of the Civil Rights Movement, if it wants to acknowledge the wrongs of its past, is it better off doing that if it's an own independent sovereign or if it's under the trusteeship of the United States government?       But a Section 2 case can, in effect, have an order for bail-in, correct me if I'm wrong, under Section 3 and then you basically have a mini -- something that replicates Section 5.
12-98 +++$+++ 
12-99 +++$+++       Do you acknowledge that your -- that your answer to Justice Kagan is -- is contrary to years of settled practices and understandings?      In other words, this kind of an agreement is very rare?      It's hard to think that one really pays or lends or delivers, which is are statutory words, neutrality of speech.
12-992 +++$+++    In a case with a jury, would you submit the question of the amount of attorneys' fees to the jury?   All right. Your answer was, I'm sure, clear, but I didn't get it.   Well, that seems, to me, to indicate that there's a final judgment when -- when the verdict is rendered.   If the fees are left, it's just a collateral matter as to what the fees will be.   I know the Petitioner doesn't rely on it, but it really is supplemental to Justice Ginsburg's point. There was a judgment in this case, the June judgment. And it -- and it says -- it's entitled, "Judgment in a Civil Case," and it says that the interest runs from this date. Now, I know there are cases in which we say that the description the trial judge gives to the judgment is not necessarily conclusive of this final order, but it does seem to me that this is what the judge thought he was doing.   The interest ran -- the interest ran from the June 17th judgment.
13-115 +++$+++    The question of mixed motive or improper motive, if we can get back to that for just a minute. Assume that the law -- and this is the Wren case -- is as follows. If there is improper motive for an arrest, but that there was an objective basis that would have made the arrest and that did make the arrest reasonable, there is no violation of the Constitution. Assume that's the law and forget clearly established, forget -- assume that's the law. It seems to me that for you to prevail, you have to say we should make a First Amendment exception because the First Amendment is so important. Or that there has to be, in another context, an amendment for racial profiling. So that the rule that I have just stated has to be qualified in some way. It seems to me you almost have to say that in order to prevail in this case.
13-132 +++$+++    Are you saying we're just resting on the discretion of the officer? Because if that's so, then that leads to the next question. Well, if that's so, then we'll get a warrant.   Well, let's leave  let's leave exigent circumstances out of it. That -- that's an easy case. You're not arguing for exigent circumstances here.   It seems to me that in order to try to give some answer to Justice Kagan's concerns that maybe the distinction ought to be between serious and nonserious offenses -- offenses. I don't think that exists in our jurisprudence. Correct me if I'm wrong.   Well, but that's not that's not quite accurate. What would you do under the Robinson rule with an attorney's briefcase?   And  and doesn't that present the exact problem that every cell phone has?   So I don't think that quite works for you.   Well, the tax return that's on -- some -- some cell phones have tax returns, so you have the tax return of the jaywalker, looking for a crime.
13-193 +++$+++    But your very argument, Mr. Murphy, to the effect that, well, probable cause is a very low standard, seems to me to work against you. It means that more complaints are more likely.   Well, but this is a point brought up by Justice Scalia's guestion as well. Don't you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with a state law that reguires you to come before a commission to justify what you are going to say and which gives the commission discovery power to find out who's involved in your association, what research you've made, et cetera?   There's a curious inversion here. Usually we're concerned about citizen suits, too many people can challenge -- challenge the law. Here we're concerned that many, many citizens can bring the challenge against the candidate. So it's somewhat reversed. In other words, you have tens of thousands of private attorney generals waiting to pounce and get these people before the commission and have to follow discovery orders.   Yeah. Why wasn't that --
13-298 +++$+++    Would you give me -- again, you already did it once -- an example of a business process patent -- of a business process idea and invention that is patentable.   Well, I -- I -- in my language, I've called that mechanical rather than process. Can you give me an example of process?   But that's how to make a -- that's how to make a machine work better.   I'm asking you any business process, any business activity that is susceptible to a patent, a pure patent, innovations that deserve patents?   Can you give me an example?   Is there an example that you can give us of a -- what we can call a business process that is patentable, a process that doesn't involve improving the workings of a computer?
13-299 +++$+++    Would you -- would you agree that it -- pursuant to the Petitioner's counsel's last comment, that it does affect the retirement decision of the original owner?   In other words -- in other words, there's a benefit to -- this is an encouragement for the original owner to retire because he knows that this can be handed down.   Yes, I agree with Justice Kagan's comment. And you argue against your own box-under-the-bed analogy by, as Justice Kagan indicates, saying that "to the extent" is -- indicates that retirement funds may be greater than what's in the clause. It seems to me that you should argue the other way around, as Justice Kagan is indicating. Or am I missing something?
13-301 +++$+++    I just want to make sure I understand. The district court has in front of it a request to enforce a subpoena. The district court has no authority at all, either on its own motion or by request from the taxpayer, to limit that scope, the scope of discovery? Millions of documents, he just has to sign it? Is that what I'm hearing?   You are in the litigation, in that litigation in the district court. Once you are before the district court, you can make an objection as to excessive scope.   It seems to me that if those are the questions you're going to ask, that almost every taxpayer's lawyer could ask those questions in almost every subpoena case. I'm -- I'm now concerned, I thought that there was agreement. I now think there's much more to the government's position than I had thought with reference to harassment. I think you can ask that in any tax case I've ever heard of.
13-316 +++$+++    But in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, the bank didn't have to refund the money. And we could sit around here all day with examples, but suppose you have a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee and he inflates the cost. This would be -- to the owner. This would be a violation of the statute. This is a sweeping interpretation you're offering us.   And -- and you've been slipping back into the hypotheticals where the bank is going to bear the loss. But your position also covers instances where the bank does not bear any loss, the fraudulent contractor that -- Justice Kagan's hypothetical about the phony painting, the bank is not going to give that money back.   So you have federalized every fraudulent transaction in the economy whenever a check is involved.   Well, I mean, I can think about it tonight, but I'd like an example of a check where the money doesn't come from a bank.   And is it -- is it true that there's a 2-year mandatory minimum?   Under this statute, is there -- is there a mandatory minimum?   I -- I agree that that interpretation substantially narrows the statute because the altered check, the bank is going to be certainly at risk of loss. If -- if we were to agree with that suggestion and were inclined to read the statute that way, is there a case that you can cite to us that says we have a duty to save poorly drawn statutes by a sensible amendment?   I mean, what -- what case do you -- what case do you want me to cite if I adopt your alternate -- your fallback position?   Does the rule of lenity provide a precedent for us to adopt the narrowing interpretation, your fallback position?
13-317 +++$+++    But why -- why couldn't that same showing be made under the law professors' theory of an event study at the certification stage?   For each -- for each one of -- of --   Oh, each day.   But even if Basic did not rely on economic theory, and there is a dispute on that -- I think the opinion is not quite clear on that one way or the other -- if later economic theories show that the market doesn't react in the way Basic assumed it automatically did, then certainly Congress would not wish to foreclose the Court from considering that new evidence if it was a strong, clear and convincing, et cetera.   But the Petitioners say that this has produced a whole new genre of investors that are quite different from the fellow that's sitting at home reading the Wall Street Journal.   And your theory doesn't seem to take that into account.   Well, you're saying that the events -- that the law professors' event study theory is flawed, then?   Well, my question along the same lines is: If the misrepresentation is established, from that category of cases, are there many that are still not certified? Because that would be inconsistent with your whole theory that the market is almost always efficient.   Can you get to part two of Justice Kagan's question, which is what is your view of the -- of the consequences if we adopt the law professors' view?
13-339 +++$+++    Well, I think there's -- there's merit to your argument. But the point is that there is no cause of action if there's a repose period and -- and that suit is commenced later. And the study commission did recognize this distinction between limitations and repose. I agree with Justice Scalia. I didn't have Justice Ginsburg's law professor, but I -- this was new for me. (Laughter.)   Other than it was mentioned in Lampf, but in a confusing way.   But it -- but it's an important difference because in the States that have repose statutes there can be no tolling. I mean that's huge; a minor, an incompetent person can't sue.   I'm saying that repose statutes, when they exist, impose substantial hardships on people that the State otherwise protects, minors and incompetents. They are out of luck.   That's the whole point. Statutes of repose do not.   Well, I think  no, I think we all concede that what we're talking about here is a statute of limitation. We're not saying it's also a statute of -- everyone can see that there is a statute of limitations here. The Federal law is a statute of limitation and so it protects minors. But the question is whether or not this other statute of repose supersedes it. So you can't look- you can't quote us to the -- to the minors part of the statute and say that it isn't -- because that doesn't address the point. You still have the general equitable point that, that the position of the Petitioner might frustrate Congress's intent.   Is it waived if it's not pled?   Is the statute of repose waived if it's not raised as a defense?   Do you want us to write an opinion that we can't trust State legislatures?
13-354 +++$+++    Is it your position that part of the compelling interest here is that you have to protect the integrity -- the operational integrity of the whole Act?   Does that mean the constitutionality of the whole Act has to be examined before we accept your view?   You -- you have exempted a whole class of corporations and you've done so under your view not because of RFRA.   Now, what -- what kind of constitutional structure do we have if the Congress can give an agency the power to grant or not grant a religious exemption based on what the agency determined? I recognize delegation of powers rules are somewhat moribund insofar as their enforcement in this Court. But when we have a First Amendment issue of -- of this consequence, shouldn't we indicate that it's for the Congress, not the agency to determine that this corporation gets the exemption on that one, and not even for RFRA purposes, for other purposes.   But you gave this exemption, according to your brief, without reference to the policies of RFRA. What -- what were the policies that you were implementing?   I still don't understand how HHS exercised its judgment to grant the exemption to nonreligious corporations if you say it was not compelled by RFRA.   Then it must have been because the health care coverage was not that important.   Under your view, a profit corporation could be forced -- in principle, there are some statutes on the books now which would prevent it, but -- could be forced in principle to pay for abortions.   But your reasoning would permit that.   I'm talking about a profit corporation. You say profit corporations just don't have any standing to vindicate the religious rights of their shareholders and owners.   What if a law like that --   Well, but you're getting away from the hypothetical. Say -- Justice Alito's hypothetical was that the impetus for this was humane treatment of animals. There was no animus to religion at all, which in the Church of Lukumi, there was an animus to the religion. So we're taking that out of the hypothetical.
13-369 +++$+++    You would agree, I take it, that if, was it, "insolubly ambiguous" were the standard that the court used, that we should reverse?   Are there cases where there are two reasonable constructions, but both would be patentable?   Would that satisfy the specificity requirement of the statute?   How can that be if it's the same test?   And that's the same test at both levels.
13-461 +++$+++    Suppose -- suppose Aereo offered a service so that the viewer at home could press three different buttons, but it takes only 45 seconds, and he could get the broadcast without advertising? And Aereo would have some way to screen out the advertising so you could watch the entire baseball game or football game without the ad -- without the ads.   Would Aereo be a performer then?   No, the consumer makes the choice. You can have it with the ads or without the ads. Push button one or button two.   I don't understand why he is the performer in one case and not in the other case.
13-483 +++$+++ 
132, Orig. +++$+++          Take a hypothetical case where North Carolina did have a real advantage and they used the money to create a facility, would that bear on the unjust enrichment claim or even the sanctions claim?         I just want -- you said the only State that contributed money to the Commission was North Carolina?            I just want to make sure I heard that right.         That s it?         Right.         Suppose -- suppose we think that the same State -- or the same-claim rule applies, and that if the Commission is asserting the same claim as the State, that then it can sue. Suppose that's the rule.       Are these the same claims?
134 ORIG +++$+++              It seems to me you're running away from the hypothetical.                    I have the question that Justice Souter has, basically to what extent does concurrent jurisdiction apply, what are the limits that we will apply in later cases to implement this concept of concurrent jurisdiction?           In the laws of some States you can't overburden an easement.               If you give a power company an easement, it can't put huge 300-foot structures on the easement without taking -- is that the kind of analysis that we have to apply in order to make your concurrent jurisdiction and the Master's concurrent jurisdiction theory work?             But that assumes that there is going to be a wharf.             You want us to say that the police power means that there cannot be a wharf if New Jersey says no.             And that seems to me inconsistent.   If Delaware says no.             That seems to me inconsistent with saying that New Jersey has a right to wharf out.             I don't know where -- what -- where do you draw the line, what is your distinction?             Under your view a riparian right exists only to say whether there should be a wharf.    The -- the State with jurisdiction over the riparian right has no interest in what's going to happen on that wharf, or what the wharf is going to look like?             What case -- and I could ask Mr. Farr the same question -- do I consult in order to give content to the term riparian rights?                   Where can I see what the substance of riparian rights is, in the -- in the decisions of this Court or in other leading decisions.              Could the State of New Jersey allow the wharf to be built for some unspecified purpose, just let it stick out there until it decides what it wants to do with it?              I'm asking a hypothetical, could it do that?    It would seem to me that would be a very stupid riparian use, but could it do that?
137, Orig. +++$+++        But what is the controlling principle in answering the question that I think you properly put?     Could these irrigators switch to something like rice, which absorbs a tremendous amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops it must be reasonably close to the earlier beneficial use?     What is -- what is the standard that we look to, to answer that question?       The standard of?       Suppose the first - suppose the first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water and returns 50 percent by seepage.     The second crop that they switch to still absorbs just 50 percent of the water but because of the -- of the pattern, the other 50 percent just evaporates?       But are you addressing the word "depleted"?       But are you saying that "depleted" means only what's withdrawn, and it's not calculated by -- with reference to what is returned?       And so, once again, you're saying that depletion is a calculation of what is taken without reference to what returns?       And your best authority for that is?       Could you -- and this is II -       In II -- in II(H), do you think "beneficial use is hereby defined to be that use by which water supply is depleted" -- and we're looking at "depleted."     Do you define "depleted" as what is taken without any reference to what is returned?       Well, I mean, that's - that's the key to this case, I take it.     Wyoming is telling us that what goes back is irrelevant so long as what is taken is for a recognized beneficial use.
138, Orig. +++$+++ 
11-398 +++$+++ 
11-400 +++$+++        And just a small point, and please correct me if I'm wrong.     It -- does this Act not require States to keep at the present level their existing Medicaid expenditure?     So, some States may have been more generous than others in Medicaid, but this Act freezes that so the States can't go back.     Or am I incorrect?       I suppose one test could be -- I just don't see that it would be very workable -- is whether or not it's so big that accountability is lost, that it is not clear to the citizen that the State or the Federal Government is administering the program, even though it's a State administrator.       And I think that's unworkable.       In your view -- in your view, does federalism require that there be a relatively clear line of accountability for political acts?       Is that subsumed in the coercion test, or is that an independent test?       Yes.       But do you agree that there still is inherent, implicit in the idea of federalism, necessary for the idea of federalism, that there be a clear line of accountability so the citizen knows that it's the Federal or the State government who should be held responsible for their program?       And does coercion relate to that, or is that a separate --       -- is that a separate doctrine?       Well, but I think the answer would be that the State wants to preserve its integrity, its identity, its responsibility in the Federal system.       But the -- but the point is -- but the point is --      -- there's no real -- there's no realistic choice.    There's no real choice. And Congress does not in effect allow for an out -- opt out.    We just know that.      And it's substantial.      I recognize the problem with that test.       Even though they're now frozen in, per our earlier discussion, to a large extent.       Of course, they have to do so by hiring a very substantial number of more employees.     There will be State employees.     There'll be substantial State administrative expenses that are not reimbursed.
12-1226 +++$+++    Traffic certificates.
12-1497 +++$+++    Yes. But 1033 is a criminal provision.   If the case is not -- the first case is not dismissed on the merits, dismissed without prejudice and then relator 2 files, your position is that that suit may be maintained?   I'm curious to know, just because of background, would the first suit toll the statute of limitations as to the second relator?
126, Orig. +++$+++    Do you agree that ordinary principles of contract law should guide our decision on the reformation issue, or is this something that's not an ordinary contract? If this were a stipulation in ongoing litigation, I could understand that we want to give the court substantial power to alter the stipulation. But this stipulation was reached as part of a final judgment that was made and that case is closed. So isn't it just like a contract or is it subject to revision more easily than a contract because it was a stipulation? It's a stipulation that's closed; it's just like a contract, isn't it?   Is there any authority that a settlement agreement is more subject to reformation than a regular contract? Is there any authority for that proposition?   Do you read Texas v. New Mexico as reforming the compact?   Well, or reforming the accounting procedures, I should say. Do you read Texas v. New Mexico as reforming anything?   Just by appointing a special master to monitor it over time, correct?
13-1010 +++$+++    You want us to write an opinion saying that whether or not health care benefits survive in a collective bargaining agreement is not a big deal?   Well, then I'm thinking -- I don't understand your answer to the guestion --   -- posed by the Chief Justice.   But that's exactly contrary to what your argument instructs.
13-1019 +++$+++    What  what -- what can you tell us about what the proper function of the court is in a case like the Chief Justice put? They said there was no attempt to conciliate and when we attempted to conciliate, they -- they wouldn't answer our calls. Now, it -- it seems to me as I read your brief that you did indicate that there was some very bare bones requirements that the agency had -- had to meet and it could be reviewed. I can't find any -- any other context where the court has essentially declined to review a statutory precondition to -- to suit at all.   But that's the difference --   We're looking -- we're looking for a safety net, that we said, please, tell us what the minimum rule is. You don't -- you have not articulated a minimum rule. All you say is I can't think of one.   And that doesn't answer Justice Breyer's question, and our general question, how do you want us to write what you want to hold in this case?   All I hear is no review, period, good-bye.   Fine, then what is the Court supposed to do to determine whether that obligation is met? So far, I think your answer is nothing.   Well, we'll just say -- I'm going to say one more time, I think there's substantial merit to your position that the courts have gone too far. But you have given us no midway, no -- no alternative.   Other than to say, no judicial review. And I think that's a serious -- it's a serious suggestion to make.
13-1032 +++$+++    It seems to me that you have to distinguish some of the hypotheticals, say, from Justice Scalia about the computer being used to expedite tax collection or the bank by saying that what we have here is an information device that's so closely linked in the ordinary course to the collection of taxes that it's collect -- but I -- I --   I don't know how you would formulate that test and I'm not quite sure how you'd get it out of the statute.   But don't you have to do that in order to distinguish those hypotheticals? That's my question.
13-1034 +++$+++  
13-1041 +++$+++    But it seems to me that what you are doing is that in order to make your case, you are saying that the second interpretation deserves the same deference, the same Auer deference as the first, and Justice Kagan's questions seem to me highlight you're -- you are basically running away from the Paralyzed Veterans.   And it -- it seems to me odd that you would represent your client and say, well, this second interpretation of its stance gets full Auer deference. I would say that it does. I would think that your position would be that it doesn't.
13-1074 +++$+++    Are there any Federal statutes that permit eguitable tolling --   -- and how are they worded? Do they say -- do they say eguitable tolling?   But based on the language of the statute, there are carveouts. And -- and as you actually explained --   But have the statutes recognized, A, there are carveouts, and B, there is something like eguitable tolling?   I understand.
13-1075 +++$+++ 
13-1080 +++$+++ 
13-1174 +++$+++    But in this --   But in this -- in this case, at the end of the day, the actions are, in effect, unconsolidated. When -- when the pretrial M -- MDL is -- is completed here, the separate judgments will be remanded to the separate courts. So you're -- what you're saying is, well, it's one action for a while, but then it's many actions again. Begins as many, then it's one for a while, then it's going to be many again. Isn't that -- isn't that the dynamic that you're --
13-1175 +++$+++    Well, what's the purpose -- you agree that it's constitutional to require the registry?   Okay. Why is the State interested in requiring the register if it can't go look at it with little notice?   What's the point?   Well, it is important because we're trying to figure out how this works.   The policeman goes with a subpoena and the hotel owner says, I object.   And how long does it take?   So in a construction subpoena, if you object and say, well, I'm going to take these records and keep them in the police car trunk until we resolve this?   There's authority for that?   There's authority from this Court?   It seems to me that's much more intrusive than the scheme you're objecting to.   Right.   The complexity of the answers and, frankly, the surprise I have at some of your answers may indicate that this is not a basis for a facial -- this is not a case for facial attack.   Seems to me we have to go back and -- and decide these issues on a case-by-case basis.   But innkeepers have been regulated, not for decades, but they've been regulated for centuries and they have -- they have duties to the public that are enforceable.   And I'm just puzzled by this case. You concede that the records have to be kept. There are very few reasons for keeping those records other than law enforcement.   But -- you're -- you're saying, oh, the hotel has a private interest because it wants to know who its customers. But they can do that by keeping their own record consensually. You have conceded that they can require the information as a matter of law.
13-1211 +++$+++    If we -- when we write this opinion, will we have to have in the back of our minds what effect it will have on likelihood of confusion, the likelihood of confusion issue? Is -- is there some way that we should treat this as quite -- quite discrete from that?   I  I recognize that.   Is it the elephant in the room or something like that? I don't know what --   -- metaphor it --   I'll check it out in my notes. I thought that there was a split on the likelihood of confusion issue on the point of whether it goes to the judge or the jury.   If I look confused by your answer, I am. I'll check it.
13-1314 +++$+++    Is it part of our jurisprudence that if it's likely that another person is more directly affected, that that goes into the balance and we say, Well, the legislature doesn't have standing because there are other people out there that are more directly affected? Do we say this in our cases?   Well, if it's -- it's not -- it's not -- for -- until 1913, for close to a hundred years, many States wanted to have direct election of the senators and they had all sorts of proposals, they had primaries and not one State, not one State displaced the legislature. It took the Seventeenth Amendment to do that.   It seems to me that that -- that that history works very much against you because the -- the term "legislature" is not in the Constitution. Now it's been taken out by the Seventeenth Amendment. The senators shall be chosen by the legislature. And there was no suggestion that this could be displaced.   Wait. Now -- now you're going to the statute. But just under the Constitution, you're -- you're saying that legislature in the first article of Section 3, the now repealed section that talks about it --   -- choosing senators means something different than what it means in the following section in the same article.
13-1333 +++$+++    Under your position, I suppose we don't have to ask about certiorari, pending whether or not that --   You can say that that's the petitioner's problem, not yours.   What about -- it seems to me the government does give away too much in that position. The only question is whether that undercuts this whole argument. It gives a little bonus for the appeal of the -- if strike number three is the district court, the government doesn't count the appeal, as I understand it. It counts -- obviously it counts in a later district court suit, but not here.
13-1352 +++$+++    May I ask this --   Suppose I'm in State X, not -- not Ohio. There's a mandatory reporting duty to the social services by the -- by the teacher, and the same facts. And I'm the trial judge, and this statement is offered, and I say, does the defense want to examine the 3-year-old or the 4-year-old, and provide some means 2 or 3 months later -- 2 or 3 months after the Dee statement, to cross-examine the child maybe in the clinical setting that you suggested in your brief. Any problems with that? What -- what if -- if we're saying what the rule should be in that kind of situation, that kind of State, what -- what guidance can you offer?   And if -- but if that happened, would the statement to the teacher come in?   And what Justice Ginsburg has said is completely consistent with your No. 3. She wants to find out the cause. She wants to know if there's something happening at home where this kid should not go back home that day.   But -- but isn't -- but doesn't that indicate that the testimonial inguiry is somewhat -- somewhat awkward and formalistic?   And -- there's -- just to follow up, it's almost the same one, that there are States in which every citizen has a -- has a duty to report abuse; is that not correct?
13-1371 +++$+++    But are you saying that in each case that the Chief Justice puts, there is initially a disparate impact at step one, that is to say, Community A wants the development to be in the suburbs. And the next state, the community wants it to be in the poor neighborhood. Is it your position, it seems to me, and the position of the Respondents, that in either case, step one has been satisfied.   But that -- that seems very odd to me.
13-1402 +++$+++    Well  well, it's --   -- it's odd to presume that there's a fundamental right and then say, well, all we're saying is that it can't be arbitrary. It's -- you -- you can't measure arbitrariness until you first define the right. You just want us to skip over that critical step.   It seems to me you're reasoning backwards.   And you -- and you would say the same thing if Congress did not give a visa preference, putting the spouse to the head of the line? You'd say the same thing?   Well, there is process in that she was allowed to petition the visa be entertained. There was very substantial process. She was entitled and did file an application for visa on the husband's behalf.   So to say that, oh, there's not process at all, that's not correct.   Well, I'm not aware of rights to contest the placement of a prisoner after a conviction. I'm trying to think of it. I just don't think there is any. So I think that hypothetical is very apt. You indicate that there's no remedy where there are two citizens living in this country, and then you want us to apply that remedy to a person who's living out of the country. National security interests are involved.   It's not such a matter -- it's not such a matter of floodgates. It's a matter of defining the basic right for constitutional purposes.
13-1487 +++$+++    As long as he gets them out of his possession.   Are you going to say he has to give them to a firearms dealer? This is very complicated, more so than I ever thought, and it seems to me that it might best be worked out by lower courts under the principle that we don't want these guns back in the hands of either his control or people who might misuse them.   Can you tell me -- it's not this case, but suppose -- somewhat like Justice Alito's hypothetical -- a man's living at home with his wife. Wife owns the firearms. The firearms are in the bedroom. He's convicted of an offense where 922(g) controls. Is he in constructive possession of those in violation of the statute?
13-1499 +++$+++ 
13-212 +++$+++    No, but what is your position? What is the rule you want us to adopt in response to the Chief Justice's question?   Can -- can -- can the police search the person's wallet and find an -- an index card with a number, my house? Can he do that --   -- and use the information obtained?   Examine the contents of the wallet but not read it? I -- I don't understand the issue.   Is -- may the police or may not the police examine a wallet, find the number that says my house, and act on that information to investigate the crime? Yes or no?   Well, it seems to me that it's fairly clear that it's part of the contents that are seized, that are on -- in the possession of the arrestee, and that the police can act on it.   The -- the question is whether it's an unreasonable search, and the warrant clause follows much later. The question is: Is this an unreasonable search?   That's what the Constitution provides.   Well, it's a search that's reasonable. That's not necessarily an exception.
13-271 +++$+++    It's -- it's not this case. You don't have to argue it, but just so that I understand -- if this conduct, these transactions, had occurred after the FCC's code of conduct, would the case be substantially different, in your view?   And is that because you rely on a conflict preemption theory?
13-352 +++$+++    Would the -- would the same rule apply in a de novo review of the board's actions in a Federal district court?   And I was going to ask you in your answer to Justice Scalia in which you've talked about the narrowness of the issues, you would make the same comments and -- and give us the same instruction regarding what issues and what evidence is presented in the district court on de novo review? (   What is the answer? Would that be confusing?   I need to know the answer --   And --   -- the -- the district court would hear no additional evidence that the board would not have heard other than the difference between oral and written?   No, no.   On de novo review.   But it seems to me that, and I'll check what the experts in this area say in the amicus briefs, but it seems to me that the fact that this is a simpler proceeding and that a person concerned about cost would want the simpler proceeding and would want the preclusion.
13-433 +++$+++ 
13-435 +++$+++    Well, it seem -- it seems to me that you're not in the middle, that you're almost 90 percent with the respondent because you -- if -- very little weight to the subjective belief component.
13-502 +++$+++ 
13-517 +++$+++ 
13-534 +++$+++    Well, going back to Justice Alito's guestion, if we have to look at it board by board, if I were a private practitioner and, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, a neurologist came to me and said, I think it's important for us to do standards, can I get on this board? I say, have no part of it. Triple damages, attorneys' fees. You can't even afford to defend this case. Get off that board. That's going to be the conseguence of your -- of the rule you advocate it seems to me.   If the conseguences of a decision in your favor were that no professionals or representative of any occupation would ever serve on a government board where there's any chance of antitrust liability, would that, in your view, advance the purposes of the antitrust laws?
13-550 +++$+++    Where -- where are you reading from?   Well, you certainly do, if that's what a prudent trustee would do.
13-553 +++$+++    So suppose the State taxed railroads at 4 percent, but then gave them a -- a credit against what they paid on the highway tax. Would you be back in the same position you are now?   That they gave -- they gave a deduction for the sales tax against what they've paid in highway taxes.   No, so the -- the truckers.   I -- I -- I misstated. They taxed the truckers the same as they tax you, 4 percent.   But then they give the truckers a deduction for whatever they paid in the highway tax.
13-604 +++$+++    Well, I'm not so sure it makes good prudential sense to allow the North Carolina Supreme Court to put to us what is basically an abstract question.   To -- to give an answer without reference to the fact that, as Justice Scalia indicates, part of the Fourth Amendment is the good-faith exception. It bears on reasonableness.   Where -- where do we find it?   Do you -- do you agree that if there is an illegal stop, that this consent is the fruit of the poison tree?
13-628 +++$+++    But why couldn't you have a disclaimer of the kind that I've explained to the Petitioners' counsel. She said that would be perfectly lawful, for you to say it's not the position of the State Department, this is not an indication that Israel is -- has jurisdiction over Jerusalem.   Why wouldn't that solve the problem?   Couldn't you say that, at a minimum, the Petitioner has conceded that it is not clear that this is recognition?   I don't  I don't like to, you know, just keep going back to the same thing. It seems to me that you could draft a statement that actually furthers your position. This passport does not indicate that the government of the United States and the Secretary of State recognize that Israel has sovereign jurisdiction over Israel, and you'd actually be making your case.   But it doesn't further -- why doesn't it further it?   But that law isn't in front of us.
13-6827 +++$+++ 
13-684 +++$+++    But that's not the position that the government has. Let's assume that the notice of rescission is baseless, the documents were received. The Petitioners, as I understand it, can say the bank -- can say: So what; you owe us money; we're doing nothing; we're not giving you your money back. And the bank's rights are protected.   But it happens in the law all the time. Sometimes you're right, sometimes I'm right. And we wait and see who sues first and you take your chances. And if the bank -- if you are the bank and you're wrong, ultimately the borrower is going to get damages, et cetera.   Well, I take it they do have to occur or there are going to be damages at least. Let's assume a valid notice of rescission 2-1/2 years down the line. The bank has a choice. There is a rescission. If the bank says we are -- we are wrong, we have to return the property, it returns the property, it complies with (b), it does it within 20 days, there's a rescission. There's no court order, there's nothing.   There is a rescission.
13-7120 +++$+++  
13-719 +++$+++ 
13-7211 +++$+++    Let -- let me just ask you this question about COAs. Let's just take a case -- there's no cross-appeal or anything. The prisoner alleges in -- inadequate assistance of counsel, and he loses. He files a COA. He says, my counsel was inadequate because there were two Wiggins errors, he did not -- two Wiggins errors. That is what he says in the COA. The COA is granted. Now he files his brief. Can he allege a Spisak error as well?   So -- so can he -- so in other words, in a COA, you have to list every error that counsel made and at -- at -- on -- on pain of not being able to argue that in your brief?
13-7451 +++$+++    Assume that Congress intended and wanted, to cure a void in the criminal statutes, to have a general prohibition against destruction of evidence and that it put it in Sarbanes-Oxley, and you make that argument. Are there any other laws of general application that were also included in the Sarbanes Act -- Oxley, or is this the only one?   What did you ask for?   Did you ask -- did you ask for or recommend a particular sentence?   Go ahead.   But he has no -- he has no doctrinal basis to make that argument other than to say that there is such a doctrine as prosecutorial discretion and, A, that it's enforceable and, B, that it has some substance, and you've indicated that it has neither.   Well, it seems to me that we should just not use the concept or refer to the concept at all anymore.   Perhaps Congress should have called this the Sarbanes-Oxley Grouper Act. (Laughter.)
13-854 +++$+++    Well, Markman hearings certainly have expert testimony, don't they?   And why should it say that if you want also just to follow the same question just -- not to separate conclusions of law -- findings of fact and conclusions of law, that's all out.   No findings of fact at all.
13-894 +++$+++    But the gravamen of your position is that after Congress enacted these statutes, anything that came within the WPA definition could be disclosed until Congress passed another statute? That's what you want us to hold?   Where could I look to find examples of where, before the regulation, there would be information pertaining to airline flights that could not be disclosed?   But that doesn't apply to this Respondent.   You're saying that this Respondent, until there was a second statute, was not prohibited from disclosing anything within the broad reach of the WPA of "uncovered a violation of matters relating to specific danger to public health or safety."   So Congress passed a statute saying: And we'll pass another statute sometime before this has any effect?   If -- if Congress wanted to reach your position and it had a choice of the words it would use in the second part of the statute, could it say "statute" instead of "law" and it would just come out the same way?   And -- and for purposes of this case and generally, there'd really be no difference?
13-895 +++$+++    But suppose they did that based on economic data?   But it results in the same thing.   And that's true at the outset if you move them by race in order to increase their capacity to influence districts?   But then it's a one-way ratchet.   Is -- is it fair to -- to read the pleadings and -- and the submission in this case as saying that the State did not defend this plan on the basis that it was for partisan purposes, but that it was to comply with Section 5?   Is that -- is that a fair reading of the -- A, of the red brief and, B, of what the district court found?   What about District -- Senate District 26?   Well, Justice Kagan's question points up the fact that the defenders of this plan did not rely on the fact that it was a political gerrymander and, of course, they said it was the 2 percent call, but the basis was race in order to comply with Section 5.   If the district court said that race was not the purpose, what in the district court's view was the purpose of the plan?   I'm asking in this case, what do you think?   Was it the presumption that they wanted to assure preclearance under Section 5 i and for that reason used race? So when you say the district court said, well, race was not the purpose, it was close to the purpose because they were trying to use Section 5 and use race for that reason.   That's a very fine distinction.
13-9026 +++$+++    Well, no, no. But we're talking about what the proper instructions to a jury, not jury nullification. Don't -- don't play -- don't play that card.   Suppose we had substantial evidence that prosecutors were using the threat of this extra charge in order to obtain guilty pleas, very substantial evidence, would that be a basis for us to rule that the statute is either inoperable altogether or that it should be interpreted in a way consistent with what the Petitioner argues?   So you think that concern is simply irrelevant to the interpretative task that we face.
13-935 +++$+++    But in the cases you just cited, did the courts say who decides the question of whether there's bare legal title?   You -- you said the case very clear, only bare legal title goes. But who -- did it -- did it go on to say that the bankruptcy court cannot decide who has the bare -- whether you have only bare legal title?
13-975 +++$+++    Well, in this case -- in this case, May 10th the minutes were approved, and May 13th the suit was filed because the time ran out on May 14th.   And you think that's sufficient?   The 30-day period is so there can be a carefully reasoned decision whether or not to file a suit. Under your view, you have only 3 days.   In your view, if they had waited 60 days before they approved the minutes, then we wait until then for the time period to run?   But it sounds like you're changing your position. Page 34 of the red brief, that given the plain wording of the statute, whether a document from a -- the guestion is, whether a document from a State or local government stating the application has been denied but providing no reasons can satisfy the statutory reguirement. And the simple straightforward answer is yes. So now you're changing your position.   But where -- but surely, under your view -- I'm not convinced that your position hasn't radically changed -- but surely under your view, what you've explained to us at page 34, the 30 days begins to run the minute the notice is given.   Did you take that position in the district court?
13-983 +++$+++    But it is a felony.   But that doesn't seem to me answers Justice Scalia's hypothetical of the friend who calls to report the threat or another hypothetical, when one student says, "I have a bomb in my lunch pail," and the other student hears it and tells the principal. Under your view, the person who hears it and tells the principal could be liable.   But what is the -- what is the suggested instruction you would have in order to eliminate liability in my hypothetical or Justice Scalia's hypothetical, it was the same thing with the friend?   Oh, well, that was not in the instruction that was given in this case.   Well, I mean, if you are saying it's waived, that's something else. But the instruction given by the District Court in this case does not meet the standard you just gave.   But it seems to me that if that's the case you should have no problem at all in accepting Mr. Elwood's suggested instruction of specific intent.   We all have specific intent, as you well know, all the time.   Well, drunkenness is often not a defense in a specific intent case.   I'm still not sure how you answered Justice Scalia's hypothetical and mine --   The threat is just repeated --   -- with no bad purpose.   In this statute there is subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d); (a), (b) and (d) all have specific intent. I think you would agree with that.   Is it proper for us then to say that it's likely that section (c) also should be a specific -- it's very odd to say that (a), (b) and (d) are specific intents but this one isn't.
13-9972 +++$+++ 
14-103 +++$+++    Well, I've -- I've been out of practice for half a century, but my -- my -- my thought was that -- that -- that lawyers do -- do charge for the amount of time preparing the bill. Maybe I'm wrong about that.   We can -- we can check it out.   Is -- is there any writing that says that when lawyers, outside bankruptcy, determine their -- their fee structures, that they include reimbursement for the risk that they might have to go into court to defend it? I've never heard that.   And that was -- that was ( my guestion. Can you tell me, if -- if a distinguished law firm represents a trustee in bankruptcy, does the law firm charge its regular rate?   The same rate that it would charge to a -- to a non-bankruptcy client.
14-114 +++$+++    Because it -- it  it does seem to me that if Petitioners' argument is correct, this is just not a rational choice for the States to make and that they're being coerced.   And that you then have to invoke the standard of constitutional avoidance.   Well, wouldn't it have been -- again, talking about Federalism -- a mechanism for States to show that they had concerns about the wisdom and the workability of the Act in the form that it was passed?   So you're saying that by -- by cross-reference to 1311, they really mean 1311 and 1321?   All right. That -- that seems to me to go in the wrong direction --   -- for your case --   -- not the right direction.   Is -- is that a synonym for ambiguity?   Well, if it's -- if it's ambiguous, then we think about Chevron. But it seems to me a drastic step for us to say that the Department of Internal Revenue and its director can make this call one way or the other when there are, what, billions of dollars of subsidies involved here? Hundreds of millions?   And it -- it seems to me our cases say that if the Internal Revenue Service is going to allow deductions using these, that it has to be very, very clear.   And it -- it seems to me a little odd that the director of Internal Revenue didn't -- didn't identify this problem if it's ambiguous and advise Congress it was.
