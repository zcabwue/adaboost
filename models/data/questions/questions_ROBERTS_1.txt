04-1034 +++$+++                 General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                How do you define tributary?           The tributary -- you say they're adjacent to a nonnavigable tributary. That's a -- a culvert, a ditch.               Right?           But in Rapanos' case.           What about -- what about the other -- the other sites?          But your argument assumes that the ditches that go to the other two sites are also tributaries.          Well -- well, as you mention that, you cited subsection (7), and there's a -- what struck me anyway as a very interesting provision in there.        It covers wetlands adjacent to waters other than waters that are themselves wetlands. Now, everything that you've said today and in your brief would lead me to think you would contend that wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands ought to be covered as well, and yet, the regulation leaves them out.      And I want to know why do you think the regulation leaves those wetlands out.          To me it -- it suggests that even the Corps recognized that at some point you've got to say stop because logically any drop of water anywhere is going to have some sort of connection through drainage.            And they're -- they're stopping there, and I wonder if we ought to take that same instinct that -- that you see in subsection (7) and apply it to your definition of tributary and say, at some point, the definition of tributary has to have an end.        Otherwise, you're going to go and reach too far, beyond what Congress reasonably intended.           But that's true of the wetland that is adjacent to the wetland that is adjacent to the tributary, and yet, the Corps says we're not going to reach the wetland that is adjacent to another wetland.           Well, but we didn't come up with the idea of wetlands next to wetlands. The Corps of Engineers has it in their regulations.           So what do they mean by it?          What -- what is an example of an insignificant nexus under the SWANCC test?          No.      There's no nexus there.          They're isolated. There's no nexus.        The -- the notion in SWANCC of a significant nexus suggests that there are some bodies of water or puddles that are going to have a nexus, but it's not going to be significant enough.                 We didn't just say any nexus.        It said significant nexus.            So what are you leaving out to give meaning to the test that we articulated in SWANCC?           So if you have a wetland, you would say a wetland with a hydrological connection to a tributary of navigable waters through one drop a year is a significant nexus to the waters of the United States?           One drop.             Am I right that a tributary is not a defined term in the regulations? Right?               Well, that's not really fair.             The Petitioners, as I understand it, both concede the discharges that make their way into the navigable waters would be covered.             And if you wanted a cite for the opposite proposition, you could cite subsection (7) of the Corps' regulations where they have no interest in wetlands that happen to be adjacent to other wetlands that are adjacent to the waters of the United States.           If they act in the way that you've been postulating, presumably they'd want to cover those adjacent wetlands just as much as they want to cover the wetlands that are next to the tributary, but they don't.             It doesn't -- it doesn't say that.          It says other than waters that are themselves wetlands.           It excludes all wetlands that are adjacent to wetlands that are adjacent to waters of the United States.               You -- you put a lot of weight on the tributary question in your approach by giving up the hydrological connection.                      Your response is you don't need a hydrological connection because it's right next to a tributary.                   But for those of us who are having a little trouble with the concept of tributary, you don't leave us much to fall back on.

WILLIAMS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 04-10566                So State -- you don't have any problem with State judges being enlisted as officers to execute Federal treaty obligations on behalf of the State Department or someone?           Of course, he doesn't have to answer that.                Thank you, Ms. Williams. Mr. Thro. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. THRO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 05-51               There was a State collateral review?               Is -- is a defense counsel a competent authority under the treaty for the purposes of notifying the accused?              You know, that's kind of a tough position to put the lawyer in.                   If he's not a competent authority for notification purposes and he makes the judgment that, you know, I don't think it's going to do any good to notify the consulate, wouldn't he be better advised not to tell his client about it? Because if he does, then it's, I guess, harmless error that the State hasn't notified him, and if he doesn't, it's kind of an ace in the hole.                   You see how the trial goes, and at the end say, by the way, the State never notified my client.              It's kind of like a speedy trial claim. Right?                I mean, if the lawyer knows he has a right to a trial within a certain number of days, and he doesn't -- it's not his obligation to notify the State.          He just kind of watches the clock and lets the clock run out, and then he has a claim based on that.           Right?                Thank you, Mr. Thro. Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS           Are there any countries that recognize individually enforceable rights under this convention overseas on behalf of American citizens?           If they don't -- if they can't ask him -- I mean, I assume many foreign nationals are detained fairly close to the border, and if you start saying, well, my first question is, are you a citizen or not, you've got to give Miranda warnings first saying you don't have to answer any question that might incriminate you.           It's kind of a catch 22.           Yes.
04-1067 +++$+++               Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT              What about the telephone call between a husband and wife, and the wife tells the police, "Listen in on this call"? She's consented to the monitoring of the conversation, the husband has not.            Maybe he even begins the call by saying, "I -- don't let anybody else listen to this." It's clear that that is admissible, isn't it?               She's consenting. It's an intrusion, in the one case, on the conversation; in the other case, on the home.                        In the telephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the consent of one party subjects the other to having the conversation monitored.               In this case, the consent of one party subjects the other party to the search.           Well, that --           -- begs the question -- it begs the question to say "it's a distinct individual right to privacy."              It's a little academic to talk about his individual right to privacy when he's sharing the home with someone else.              Well, all --              -- reflects is the - -              I was just going to say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy.                     And when you do live with someone else, you compromise your individual privacy interest to that extent.                     We know that you compromise it to the extent that if you happen not to be there, and that person says, "Sure, come on in and search," that's going to bind you, as well.       Why is it -- why do you not compromise the expectation to the extent of giving the other person the right to consent?           Well, that's not a fair reading of Rodriguez.             There, it was, "Come on in, he's asleep."         It was quite clear that if he were awake, he was going to say, "Don't come in."           When you talk about that tie, your approach applies in the case -- a dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms off of it, nine people say, "Sure, come on in and search," and the one person says, "No."                That one person exercises a veto over a search of the common area?           What -- well, what is your answer --           -- to that case? Your case is that, if one out of ten who share the common room says to the police, "You may not come in," that controls?               So, can I just take the next step in my hypothetical?                    The wife and the two adult children who live in the home say, "Come on in," and the husband says, "No."                    What happens then?           Reasonably, the person realizes he would be outvoted?           So, it does go to his presumably objectively reasonable views of what nature of privacy he has.           So, if he thinks, "Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife.                  I think she's going to consent and let the police in if I'm not" -- then his objection shouldn't control?           But they don't have the same -- they don't have the same property interest as a spouse does, as a tenant in common or whatever. The child doesn't have that interest in the home.
04-1084 +++$+++               Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Ms. Hollander. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NANCY HOLLANDER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS           So, your theory would be if you had a religious group that -- whose doctrine was that you should proselytize through hoasca, and they want everybody to come, and they're aggressive in doing that, and distributing hoasca, that the Government should be in a position of saying, "This religious group can use it, but that religious group can't"?           Yes, they're the kind of the -- the ones I just gave you.                In other words, if there's going to be a greater threat of diversion to -- it's not limited to the members of a very cohesive and limited group, but it's -- they're -- they aggressively try to reach out, but it's all part of a sincere religious belief, that we should, in applying RFRA, draw distinctions between the group you represent and that hypothetical group?           Well, I'm assuming they show --           -- that there is --           Yes.            Well, I --            -- thought that's because we made a special reservation for peyote.           It was the right answer.            Well, it has to be extracted at some point to be -- to get into -- I'm right here -- to get into the tea, right?                      It's extracted by the preparation of the tea.            The plants are not -- the plants are not imported, right?                      Just the tea.            Okay.               Right.               Right.               I guess I -- if I could just go back to the point.                 You're emphasizing that the Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants.                       But you're not importing plants, you're --               -- importing a mixture that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't have its effect.          So, under your --          -- theory, a marijuana tea would not be covered by the Treaty.          Yes, but they're not being imported, they're transformed into this tea.                     And you -- saying the active substance isn't there independently, so it's not covered.                    And that seems to me to be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.             Well, except that you don't import the plants, right?          To the person.     To what person?

04-1140 +++$+++                 Mr. Chilton, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN T. CHILTON ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS           I thought a comparative advantage of the Solicitor General's approach, and, by the same token, of the Petitioner's contrary approach, is that it avoids a lot of litigation over a collateral issue, like which court you ought to be in.               As soon as you get into a multifactor analysis, then you get briefs on both sides arguing their factors and the other side's factors, and the judge has to decide.                    If there's a presumption that applies in most cases, you don't waste time over jurisdictional squabbles like this.             What is your position on what fees we're talking about.                  Do you agree with your friend that money that's spent, that's going to have to be spent anyway in the State court proceeding, though, is not wasted, that that's not recoverable?           Well, it's not those very cases.         By definition, this issue only comes up when the case should not have been removed.           So, it's not the cases that Congress wanted to be removed that we're talking about.
04-1144 +++$+++                Thank you, General.         Ms. Dalven, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER DALVEN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS           Counsel, if your objection goes to the adequacy of the bypass procedure, what is wrong with a pre-enforcement challenge by physicians, presumably with standing, challenging the bypass procedure?                 Why should you be able to challenge the act as a whole if your objection is so narrowly focused?            But it's a problem that arises only in the emergency situations.            So bring in a pre-enforcement challenge concerning compliance with the act in emergency situations.                  Why does that even implicate the vast majority of the cases that don't create emergency situations?            This case doesn't involve an emergency situation.                 This is a facial challenge.          There is no case at issue at all.           That's because the Court explained the inadequacies it identified were present in the large fraction of cases.                     We don't know if that's true here.           Well, but that would be litigated in a pre-enforcement, as-applied challenge.          I mean, you don't assume -- the fact that this narrower focused proceeding is going to be -- could be brought doesn't mean -- doesn't answer the question of how it's going to come out. But presumably the litigation would be very similar to what we've seen in this case, in which a doctor is saying, well, you do need an immediate medical exception.               Others are saying the judicial bypass adequately addresses the concerns. But it would be focused on the provision that is causing you concern rather than the statute as a whole.             Your complaint asked for a preliminary and permanent injunction against the act.           Well, maybe they assumed that the medical health exception of the sort you're arguing for is not constitutionally required and that's what would be litigated in a narrow focused challenge on the adequacy or inadequacy of a bypass procedure.         Maybe they assumed it would follow the Salerno precedent, and they didn't have to worry about severing in light of particular unconstitutional applications.           Do you think the statute, putting aside the medical emergency issue under our precedence, is the parental notification aspect of the statute constitutional?           Other than the confidentiality?

JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS             No, that's --             I'm sorry, but the most communicative aspect is saying what you think about a particular policy.               This is conduct, denying access to the military recruiters.           Well, no that --           So, if you had a policy that, "We're going to deny any employer that uses tanks," do you think that would pass muster under the Solomon Amendment?           What about Yale Law School?             But it doesn't --             -- it doesn't insist --             It doesn't insist that you do anything.            It says that, "If you want our money, you have to let our recruiters on campus."            Under -- what about South Dakota against Dole?              South Dakota had a constitutional right, under the twenty-first amendment, to set whatever drinking age it wanted, and yet we upheld the Spending Clause condition that if they accepted Federal funds, they had to set their drinking age at 21.            There's the right to -- in the Constitution, to raise a military.           But --           I'm sorry, but, on compelled speech, nobody thinks that these -- law school is speaking through those employers who come onto its campus for recruitment.                Everybody knows that those are the employers.            Nobody thinks the law school believes everything that the employers are doing or saying.           -- "we believe in strongly, but we don't believe in it, to the tune of $100 million."           Dale is -- Dale --               And you -- and you're perfectly free to do that if you don't take the money.               Thank you --               -- Counsel.

WOODMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              But is it reasonable to suppose that one of those cases where it's too hard to decide is when there are 50 molecules on one side and 50 on the other?            In other words, it would seem to me that that's an easy case to say that the State has not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the aggravating ones when the evidence is evenly balanced.             What -- what is the statutory equipoise provision?             Well, that's my question.         There is no --             There is no statutory equipoise provision.           The State has a burden of proof to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors don't outweigh the aggravating.                  That's what you mean by the statutory equipoise provision?               Well, that's because the -- the formula is that the issue has to either have been raised or decided.            But I don't -- I don't -- excuse me.          I don't understand how that makes any sense.          If you had an -- a -- a case that's litigated entirely on State law grounds and in the State supreme court opinion, they announce we are sua sponte deciding this on the basis of the Federal Constitution and you, State, lose, your argument is that State is just out of luck.

That's all that's -- that's all that's -- and that's all that's in the State.        Are they located in that State?           Do we owe any degree of deference to the Comptroller's interpretation of the provision?           What do you do with their -- their hypothetical in both your friend's brief and the Government's brief about Ford Motor Company, not in terms of 1332 but common parlance?               If you ask somebody where Ford Motor is located, they're likely to respond by saying, well, what do you mean?                 Do you mean their headquarters?           Do you mean the -- the plant down the street?           Do you mean the dealership?        It does suggest that located doesn't have the clear meaning that you rely on.           And the same would be true if you were dealing with a State bank incorporated in North Carolina with its principal place of business in Virginia that had 50 branches in South Carolina. The same thing --           -- would still be true.           And that's the parity that Congress has -- that has been the guiding principle of Congress' enactments in this area since 1882.

In other words, they say you're already subject to most of these obligations anyway, and it's just a little bit extra, under the ADA.

Well, it also said, in the last paragraph, "all of the predicate acts supporting the jury's verdict."           No, it says --           -- "all the predicate acts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation."            So, it's quite clear what "all" was referring to.           Is there anything that -- under your reading of the Hobbs Act, that isn't covered by the FACE Act?           No, I know.     But in terms of the -- we now have specific legislation addressed to the specific context.            And all of the acts that you're complaining of in the original suit are actionable under the FACE Act, aren't they?             Well, we've also said that we don't assume a substantive change from a recodification.             So, your argument requires us to assume that Congress intended a substantive change when it recodified the Hobbs Act.             Who -- who's enacted the model penal code?             Well, your friend's answer was that that was an implied right-of-action case; and, therefore, the remedies had not been spelled out; and so, you assume the broader remedies.                      What's wrong with that answer?          Well, Congress never discussed the change in the Hobbs Act that you're proposing, in 1948. [Laughter.]

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS            I guess what they would say is that there -- they insist only that the agreement be to arbitrate, and to the extent there is an agreement to arbitrate, they can enforce section 2, and the arbitrator can decide whether the broader agreement is enforceable.              But almost every State --              -- almost ever State will -- has an exception for contracts that are void against public policy.                And it s just left to the creativity of the lawyer in any given case to explain why a particular contract is contrary to public policy. And you would allow that to be shifted from the arbitrators to court presumably based simply on an allegation, well, the contract is void, it s against public policy.             But there s no -- but -- but why do you assume that that underlying illegality taints the arbitration clause?                 I mean, take the arbitration clause that you would find in a perfectly normal contract, and if you put it in the -- the contract of the sort that you re hypothesizing, I don t see why this underlying substance of the contract taints the enforceability of the arbitration clause.

KISE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT              Would it -- would it always be an abuse of discretion for the District Court to do this if the State wanted to reach the merits?           There's no question of     -- put aside a sandbagging case, there's no question of sandbagging, and that the -- the State just wants to litigate on the merits rather than on the statute of limitations.           In other words, can they have it -- would it be an abuse of discretion in an express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture case?           Why doesn't your position on the underlying merits of the timeliness question create an incentive for every habeas petitioner to file a cert petition?           Well, you --           -- you only get the extra 90 days if you actually file, under your explanation for why this cert petition is -- why this habeas petition is untimely.              In other words, if this individual had filed a cert petition with us, his petition -- his habeas petition would be timely.                    And he's only going to get the extra period, as I understand your position on the timeliness, if he files a cert petition.           Right.           Even if they file a cert petition.           So, doesn't that put them in the position of sometimes having to file that -- the habeas petition while the cert petition is still pending, if they file one?            Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT           But with respect to some --           -- of those, of course, AEDPA specifically promulgates new rules about when they're waived, and not.               And they -- Congress hasn't done that with respect to the statute of limitations.              But, of course, "may" is -- "may" is embraced within "must."

SULLIVAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              But this in -- as a practical matter, this screen is really the heavy lifting in the antitrust cases.                  This is where you need all the economic studies, you have the discovery, the experts.         This is what costs a lot of money and shifts a lot of the litigation burden on the other side if you have a presumption.           If your -- if your arguments are right, isn't that going to typically be the case?         In which case, why do you need a presumption at all?           Are you conceding that the presumption makes no sense outside of the requirements metering context?              Well, didn't they do that?       Didn't they do that in the Patent Misuse Reform Act?           But isn't it logically inconsistent for Congress --           -- to say that a patent is insufficient evidence of market power in the misuse context and then just turn around and say, but if you're having a straight lawsuit under antitrust, it is sufficient as a presumption?           So it gets back to how important you think and how -- whether it's true or not that the market power is the heavy lifting, as far as all these screens go.            But isn't -- it's in fact easier for you here.             You can go down to the Patent Office and see what they've distinguished as -- the sense in which their product is an innovation and why it's not just like the other products that might be available that you could use.

ZIEVE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS             What -- what's wrong with the Government's distinction of Digital that here you have a policy embodied in a statute as opposed to a private settlement agreement?           Is it -- is it -- maybe this is an incorrect way to look at it, but there is a relationship between the merits and the interlocutory review decision.               I would suppose if we agreed on the merits with the Government -- in other words, adopted a fairly clear and categorical rule -- the need for an interlocutory appeal would diminish because the district courts would almost always get it right. But if we adopt a standard for the application of this bar that, you know, depends on a lot of different things, then the appellate court is going to disagree with the district court in a greater number of circumstances, and maybe we should allow an interlocutory review of that.           Did you -- did you make the argument or the point that Justice Stevens articulated earlier about the -- the provisions of this chapter not applying and that including 2676?           Does it sound good or bad to you now? (Laughter.)            What is the -- as a practical matter, though, what is the great burden on the plaintiffs in requiring them to sue the individual defendants first if they're concerned about the judgment bar?           Well, you don't -- you don't have to bring them simultaneously.               You can bring the individual action first, separately.

GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   It adds a layer of Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back and forth, but if it's -- particularly if it's nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching, suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather than focusing on the statute.                     Well, which way does that cut?   That just indicates that this is profitable for the patent bar. (Laughter.)                      Where in claim 4 do you say it's putting it together in a particular way?                      Right, page 8.                   Who do you get to be an expert to tell you something's not obvious.                   I mean, the least insightful person you can find? (Laughter.)                     Exactly.                    Well, that's because the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after, on prior art, as opposed. To I would say common sense.                 And so they say we have to find something in prior art to show that this was non -- that this was obvious.                     And just -- what makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving piece?                     But just to follow up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic control on a part of the car that doesn't move?                     Right.                  And the wires would get worn, worn down, right?            And the invention here is well, let's not put it somewhere where it doesn't move, and so the wires won't move and it won't get worn down.

Do they get to make -- do they get to make "inevitable" arguments on their side?             I mean, let's say, as what happened here, or as seemingly happened, the fellow is found near the chair with the drugs.                   Can't they argue, "Well, if you had knocked and you had waited 10 seconds, he would have gotten up from the chair and gone somewhere else"?               And you wouldn't have been able to argue, at trial, "He was sitting in the chair with the drugs."           There was something in the chair, right?          I mean, the --           -- the gun, or what --           Hmm.           You wouldn't have been able to tell the jury, "I was standing next to the chair, because if I had -- I obviously would have gotten away from the chair, because I knew that's where the gun was."           Well, that's not true.       I mean, there are going to be situations, or at least possible, where evidence is going to be a -- causally connected to a violation of the knock-and- announce rule, right?           The situation -- the warrant is because these people were involved in a shootout with the -- you know, the Johnson gang; they knock the door down and somebody yells, "Look out, it's the Johnson gang."           And if they had knocked and announced, and "It's the police," they wouldn't have that statement that's incriminating. Now, you would agree that that statement would be excluded because of the violation, right?              Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Salmons. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B.

FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT            But the --            But the fraud is caused -- the fraud causes other people to want to buy the security.         They do so at a higher price.        It causes the price to go up.        It's "in connection with a purchase or sale," maybe not of the holder's securities.                   But it's certainly -- the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but for purchases and sales that caused the price to go up.            But what your clients want to do is cash in on the fraud.                   They don't -- their claim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an inflated price to somebody who didn't know about the fraud.       That's the damages that they want to collect.                 And that seems to be an odd claim to recognize.           Certainly.                Thank you, Counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT            Well, but your point, though -- I mean, someone illegally reentering at that time might not have had a reasonable expectation of the availability of discretionary relief.                   On the other hand, someone in the -- a petitioner's position, after all that had happened, did have a fairly good case under those provisions that were no longer available.           Well, and someone entering says, "Well, obviously, if I'm detained the day after I enter, I'm not going to have a very good case.       On the other hand, if I'm not, and I happen to make a life here, and I'm here for 20 years, and I get married and I have a child, I'm going to have a strong case," and he's going to -- he's willing to take his chances.                That --                That person has not illegally reentered the United States?                      He's gone back, but he did illegally reenter the United States.

Which officers, FBI agents or DEA or something else?        I mean, you're -- you're adding to the text of the amendment, and I just wonder what else is added under your view.           No.    That's your argument.         I'm just saying what else is joined at -- at the hip besides time.           You say they don't say time. They say persons to be seized and place to be searched, and you say inherent in that is time.                  Well, what else is inherent in there?           That's time.    Is there anything else that's not written there that is part of that particularity requirement?           Well, there's all sorts of, as Mr. Dreeben explained, reasonableness.                 It doesn't say how you enter the house, but if you suddenly go in with a -- with a tank, we might find that unreasonable.        But that's not something that has to be spelled out particularly under the terms of the Fourth Amendment.           It doesn't have to be spelled out in the warrant itself.

PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT           But --           But the whole point -- at least I understand -- of Justice Breyer's question is that you have taken a step to make it more difficult for the mail to get through by insisting that the person be there to sign for it, and it's obviously more likely than not he's not going to be there.                  And if you had just used regular mail and dropped it off, I think more likely he would have gotten it.           No.   The purpose of certified mail is to make sure you know if it didn't get to the person.           And you knew that and then you didn't do anything about it.           Well, counsel, one thing you did -- your client did was provide notice by publication in a local newspaper.           Why do you bother doing that?           You don't -- you don't rely on that as in any way discharging your constitutional obligation to provide notice to the -- to the homeowner.           But your --           But your -- your position is, though, when you get the certified letter returned is you have no obligation to do anything further.           Oh, you would get the whole -- you'd just get a little bit less because the cost of notice is borne by the purchaser and if they have to do a Google search or use one of these other services, it's going to add a little bit more to their cost, and you're just going to get a little bit less. It's not going to interfere with the administration of the program.           For getting the property --             -- for getting the property in this case, we're at 20 percent of its market value.           It's -- it's worth another $500 to you.             No, no, no.   That's -- Mr. Phillips, property bought at -- at delinquent tax sales is usually bought at far less than its market value.           Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Feldman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS           Of course, none of this would have been sufficient if we were talking about your -- your client, the IRS.                   They do far more extensive effort to find the individual before they sell property for delinquent taxes.               Well, which way is that -- I mean, the fact that he tried six times and he wasn't there should have told the State this isn't working.           Well, but your position is they don't have to do anything.               Well, Mullane said that we look to what a person who really wanted to find the person would do.              A person who really wanted to find Mr. Jones and got the certified letter back saying, nobody is claiming this, would have done something more.           Which -- which you agree does no good at all.             Right?           When is the last time you read legal notices in a newspaper?           Have you ever done it?           No. (Laughter.)            Sure.

DAVID BLAIR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT           And the Federal statute provides you, you think, with a defense to the State law claim.           Why -- why was there Federal jurisdiction in this case in the first place?           So -- so your view of jurisdiction depends upon the Federal defense.           Is that -- and which of our cases say that a Federal defense supports Federal jurisdiction?           Allows you to come into court if the claim that would have been brought against you would have been brought in Federal court, and the claim that would have been brought against you would have been under Arkansas law.           Sounds like a defense.           It still sounds like a defense to me, counsel, and I think it may make a difference if your argument relies on the anti-lien provision as a defense or perhaps relies on the -- the assignment provisions in the Medicaid statute.                  That's why I'm just trying to focus on whether it's the assignment provisions that limit what Arkansas can do as a matter of its own law, or if it's the anti-lien provision as a defense.           Is there any reason that the Federal law would have to act as a limitation on the State law?        In other words, if we read the -- the Federal law your way, is there any reason it would frustrate the Federal purposes for the State to say, well, we want to get all of the medical expenses?                We don't just want to get the proportionate share of the recovery.         That -- that's enough for the Feds, but we are also out State money and we want that State money. They can go further, can't they?           In the absence of the anti-lien.

STEVEN ROWE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT               Is there a --               Is there a discharge if you have a simple waterwheel in the river?                       Is that a discharge?               Yes, so it's a old hydroelectric plant, it uses a simple waterwheel.                        I mean, is that -- does that fit your definition of a "discharge"?            In other words, it restrains the water temporarily.               And then it releases it again as it passes by the wheel.               So, if you put a waterwheel in a flowing river, under your definition, that's a discharge into the navigable water.            But that doesn't -- but that --           But that doesn't matter to your analysis.            It's the one post, right?           I mean, if you have just sort of a foot indentation on either side, would -- the flows, in -- under your view, suddenly becomes a discharge.           Well, but --           -- we're trying to --           -- define --           -- a statutory term that's going to apply in a wide variety of cases.            Well, then -- but your focus -- in response to my question about what would constitute release, you focused on the fact of impoundment, a restriction of the flow.                 It seems to me that the ladle analogy that the Court has made part of the law of the land is -- refutes that, because if it's hold      -- you're holding it up in the ladle, that's like an impoundment.         You've separated it, to that extent, from the other body, and the Court said, when you pour it back in, that's not --            -- that's not a discharge of a pollutant --            -- and there was no dispute that there were pollutants, so it must mean it wasn't a discharge.           But you --           -- you don't -- you don't value it as much as FERC does, though, do you?           I mean, isn't one way to look at this -- I mean, the concern is that your constituents probably have a higher priority and a greater concern with the environmental consequences of generating power, while FERC's priority is to make sure that we have sufficient power.                   And you're likely to weigh these competing uses in very different ways.           I'm sorry --           Thank you, General Rowe. Mr. Minear. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT              Counsel, I was --           -- surprised, in a case involving a FERC license condition, that no one from FERC signed on to your brief.           But if it's a case involving a FERC license, and FERC isn't there, I think it says a great deal.           Do you know what FERC's --           Do you know what FERC's position is --           -- in this case?               Well, I'm sure of that, and it involves a reconciliation of --               -- competing positions.             Is there anything that FERC has issued that is illuminating with respect to their view?               Do you agree that a State could adopt water quality standards that would, in effect, preclude hydroelectric power in the State?               Would they do --               -- it statewide?               Saying, "It is of utmost importance to us to provide habitat for spawning salmon, whatever, dams interfere with that in a way we find objectionable, so we're going to go a different direction, as a matter of power policy for the State of whatever, and not allow hydroelectric power."

Counsel --           Counsel, you -- you say in your brief -- I'm reading from page 13 -- that the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor groups and elected officials often determine the positions officials take.             Can you give me an example of an official who took a position because of the ties to donor groups?              So your position is that that official's official positions were determined by the donor groups, as you say in your brief.              Well, your brief says determined.            And did -- did you --              So it should say influenced rather than determined.              How many prosecutions for political corruption have you brought?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA WRIGHT ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT VERMONT PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP           But I thought --           -- when you look at the -- the record, Vermont would be the last place that you'd be worried about it.               The political culture, as we just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door, and that's what the Vermonters expect.                 And it doesn't take an arms race to get on your feet and go door to door.       And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma on the respondents' side of the case between justifying low limits by saying you don't really need money to run effectively and at the same time suggesting that there's a serious problem with too much money.           Which is it?               How do you -- how do you police that, though?                Because an incumbent can -- has so many opportunities to go before the public that wouldn't necessarily be categorized as campaigning but as part of his or her official duties, while everything a challenger does is going to be credited against his account.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT           So why isn't that, as Justice Breyer prefaced his question, an issue of preclusion rather than, as you frame it, an issue of jurisdiction?           Counsel, I don't -- I don't see how the interference with the probate court that you're articulating is any greater than the interference in Markham.            In Markham, it was a decision by a Federal court that these claimants were not going to claim under the will.               Why is -- isn't that even greater than the interference you're complaining of?              Yes, but she's not -- she's not even going after the assets in this case. She's asserting an in personam claim against the individual.            Correct?            The -- the only court I've heard of that can do that is the Federal bankruptcy court.            Thank you, counsel.
04-1581 +++$+++                 Thank you, Mr. Bopp. General Clement, we'll hear now from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                In MCConnell against FEC, you stood there and told us that this was a facial challenge and that as-applied challenges could be brought in the future.                This is an as-applied challenge and now you're telling us that it's already been decided.         It's a classic bait and switch.           Is there any other case that you can cite where we've upheld a facial challenge and then later said that an as-applied challenge was barred by our ruling on the facial challenge?           Like Justice Stevens, I think that's a yes or no. (Laughter.)           What --           Well, that's a very different question.         That's interpreting the scope of Congress's power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.         The issue is whether it's limited to the constitutional violations or sweeps more broadly.                     If you conclude that it sweeps more broadly, it's not suggesting that an as-applied challenge can be brought by someone who's covered by the broader sweep.                     That's a very different question. Is there any First Amendment case where we've said this is facially valid and then said as-applied challenges can't be brought?              Well, it would be like in any of those cases where you have a -- a broad prohibition and you say, yes, there may be situations where it's unconstitutional, but the statute is valid on its face.             And then someone comes in and says, well, my situation is one where it's unconstitutional.                     We've never said, well, it's too bad because it's valid on its face, have we?           So let's say you had an organization that every month of every year it took out an ad the first week of every month, and it said the same thing and it said, contact your Senators. This issue is important to us.               And they do that every month.       All of a sudden, their ad's nature changes because an election is -- happens to be coming up and it's illegal the month before the election, even though it was clearly something that they did without regard to the election.          If we want to place an ad in October, the solution is to place an ad November through September, and then we're okay.                    And the only reason we're going to do it November through September is so we can do it in October?           That's a pretty broad definition of a sham.           But on an issue like this, the filibuster, it's the Senators who are doing it, and their ad referred to not only the Senator who was up for election, but the one who was not.           That may be because the people who were doing the filibuster were the Senators.         It's not -- it's not a surprising thing to link the Senators to that issue.           The fact that it mentions both -- the fact that it mentions both Senators strongly suggests to me that it's concerned about the issue because one of the Senators wasn't up for election.           Well, if you're trying to influence the Senators who are presumably or possibly in their home State during a recess, that's perfect timing to influence the Senators who are the ones engaging in the filibuster --           -- without regard to whether they're running for election or not.           I've lost track of it.      Your -- your answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical about Bread for the City and the hurricane and all that is that that would be an illegal ad?              But both of those examples, of course, are quantities, and once you -- I think it was Holmes who said, once you admit the necessity of drawing a line, you know, you can always find something on one side or the other.                   It's quite different between $1,000 and $2,000 or 100 feet and 75 feet and advocacy with respect to an election and advocacy with respect to an issue.                    It's an entirely different quality of a distinction, it seems to me.
04-1618 +++$+++               Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Hart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. JONATHAN HART ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              That was -- in many of those cases cited in your brief, it was because the duties they were performing they were performing pro bono publico.              And the doctrine extended immunity to them on that basis, not -- not as sovereigns.              Well, I'm not sure that operating bridges at the time of the framing was a core sovereign function.              There are an awful lot of private bridges.              But the -- the court of appeals has said that you weren't asserting that you were an arm of the State.              All that establishes is simply that if the State were operating this bridge and if the State were on the hook for any judgments and if the State had control over the people who were making the decisions, that there might be an issue of State sovereign immunity.              The whole problem is that it's the county that's doing all that.              Well, the State doesn't pay the damages.              The State doesn't tell you how to do it.              But that's a different question.            The immunity looks to where the money is going to come from to satisfy a judgment.                      I don't think it looks to where the funding came from in the first instance.              It's the claim on the treasury of the judgment that raises the sovereign immunity issues.              It's not unusual that counties maintain and run bridges in your State, is it? I mean, that's --              That's the normal --              Then -- then how do we know it's a core dignity function of the State if they're -- the normal rule is somebody else does it?
04-1704 +++$+++                 Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Enrich. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER ENRICH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS           What was --           Can I back you up just a bit before we talk about piggybacking?                This Court hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have standing in this sort of situation, have they?           So, if you want us to piggyback, we -- and if it is an article III question - - we would have to decide that issue before we can decide whether we can piggyback your current claims onto it.           Right.   And you agree that the --           And you agree that the municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax question is an open issue before this Court.                 We have not had a holding on that.                Well, then all the -- but all you're saying -- but you have to do business in the State with the lower income tax rate to get the advantage of the lower rate.                Well, that --                -- would seem to present the same Commerce Clause problem that you're posing for us today.             Some States -- Counsel, some States have homestead exemptions to property taxes for people when they're buying homes in the State.          That -- those would be invalid under your theory?             Yes, but that --             -- that person may have another piece of property in the -- in the other State.             And he's not getting the benefit of this, because his homestead -- he lives somewhere else.          But they're two identical pieces of property, and they'll say -- one say, "You're going to be taxed at a lower rate if that's where you're living, if that's your homestead; but if you happen to live outside the State, you're going to get taxed at a higher rate."             It would seem to be very similar to what you're challenging here.          No, it's imposing tax on property in the State at a higher rate if it's not the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't live in the State.           It's the same purpose.         There's some place -- they want people to move in -- into the District here, for example, just like Ohio wants businesses to move in.
04-1739 +++$+++                Thank you, Mr. Marcus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERE KRAKOFF ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT               Mr. Krakoff.           Mr. Krakoff, what -- I take it you wouldn't have any objection to terminating of television rights, for example.                If prisoners have the right to watch television, they misbehave, the penalty is no television.                Is that all right?               What other alternatives would you have the prison administrators rely on?         You have an incorrigible prisoner who's misbehaving.             He won't behave.        They go through every -- he gets up to level -- level 2.                     What -- what should they have done instead?               I'm sorry.    What should they have done instead?                   Let's say he gets out of the prison 1 hour every other day.                      Should they have taken that hour out?             I mean, not out of the prison. Out of his cell.             Should they have taken that hour away, or what -- what other options do they have?               Right, and I want you to tell me --           I would like you to tell me what else they should have done.                   Why is that wrong?           And none of that worked. Right?           So your answer to my question is there's nothing else they could have done, but they shouldn't have done this because this wasn't going to work either.           Well, then now you're giving -- now you're making their situation worse because they tried to make your client's situation better.        I mean, yes, they could -- maybe they could prohibit religious journals as well, but they -- for various reasons, they decided not to do that.                  Maybe they could have eliminated legal materials as well, but again, they decided not to do it.                They take a more circumscribed approach.           So I'm not sure it's a very effective response to say, well, they let religious materials in and that can be used as well.               So if visitors -- if there's a security issue with visitors to the prisoner, you're saying you can't prohibit visitors because if you allow the lawyers to come in, because they're visitors too?               Well, but it wouldn't undermine the security rationale just because you have some exceptions where there are other countervailing interests that might outweigh the security concern.            And once you're in that situation already, as these prisoners are, and they're still not conforming their behavior to the prison rules, you have a limited number of options for trying to get them to do that, and your response to my first line of questioning was that there's nothing else you can think of that they could do.               So your response is they should just grin and bear it.                     They --                Thank you, counsel.
04-373 +++$+++         Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Ravenell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. RAVENELL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT        What if it --        What if, instead of the half hour or so, 24 hours had passed and they got a call from the defendant, said, "I want to talk now"?               Still, is that -- is that initiation on his part?        Okay.     So --        -- if you can --          I would have thought --          I would have thought you would have said, then, 24 hours doesn't make a difference.                  If there can never be a cure, if there's a violation because the question from Reese constitutes interrogation, and you're telling us there's no cure, it doesn't matter how long it is.           Okay.           Well, assuming --           -- there was --           -- assuming there was overreaching on the part of Officer Reese, my question is, Is there any circumstance in which that overreaching can be cured? And I thought your answer is that, yes, that with the sufficient passage of time, it can be cured.           So, once Officer --           -- once Officer Reese made his comment, there was no circumstance, even a week, a month -- relatives come in and say, "We think you ought to talk," no intervening circumstance -- once there is that one sentence of overreaching, he can never initiate contact -- discussion with --           -- the police.          Well --          Well, you don't want the --          -- you don't want the officer talking to Blake directly.              I thought that would be another violation.          But it seems --          -- to me that it's a bit much to say that the problem is that the -- he didn't talk to Blake directly, because that gets into another extended dialogue with the defendant that the defendant has not initiated.        It seems it's much better, in the defendant's presence, to do what Johns did here, which is to rebuke Reese for the interrogation.            Counsel, there's no dispute about the historical facts found by the judge.                   Everybody agrees this is the dialogue that took place, this is the time that it took place.            Those are factual questions. It's a very different question of what the significance of that is under the Edwards initiation rule.                    So, it's not an issue of deference to the trial-court judge.                    We know what the facts are.        We're deferring to those findings of fact.              It's a question of what the legal significance is.          Well, just to -- stop there. Why is the trial court better suited to apply the Edwards rule to a set of facts that we would -- we accept based on deference to the factfinder?         Counsel, is my --         -- is my understanding of the Maryland law in effect when this happened correct that if you prevail on suppression, your client cannot face charges, no matter what the other evidence is?         Right.         But that --         -- that law applies to this case at this time, correct?         Thank you, Mr. Ravenell.

RODDY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT           I mean, that's the whole point is that the --           -- the fraud gives him a competitive advantage not just over the, you know -- his -- his brother-in-law's company that he's trying to get at, but over everybody who's in the business.              They're -- they're one more step removed.              I don't know if they're one step removed.            I mean, if there were no allegations of motive or family feud or targeting and all we know is that there are two competitors there and the one underpaid its taxes, is your case still viable?              So it doesn't depend on motive or targeting or anything at all.                It just depends on the fortuity of there being two competitors in a particular area.           Well, you've cited the Solicitor General's brief --              -- earlier.   The Solicitor General says it's inherent in the concept of proximate cause.            In the absence of reliance, you don't have proximate cause.

ROBIN-VERGEER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT            But in Justice --            -- in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, if the employee filed a lawsuit claiming a violation of his first-amendment rights, you would say that could not be thrown out, on summary judgment, on the ground that the speech was within the scope of his employment.           No.           Well, that would --           -- be a dispute of fact, so it probably wouldn't -- so it wouldn't be thrown at summary judgment at all.           Why doesn't --           -- why doesn't Rust answer this question?           I mean, there, it was really -- this issue was just outsourced by the Government.                    They paid for the speech there, and we said that if you pay the piper, you get to call the tune.                And this is just an insourced -- the same question.           He was writing a memo about why the case should be dismissed.                  Wasn't --           -- that part of his job?           Well, why is that?       In the -- in your hypothetical, the doctor is -- it's not his job to challenge the restriction on the Government grant, but that's what he's doing, so that's not part of his job. Here, it's part of Ceballos's job to explain why the case should be dismissed, and that's what he wrote in his memo.           What do you do with your friend's response to that, that in Connick the Court characterized Givhan as involving a case of a citizen complaining about a particular practice?               Do you think he should have lost under the Pickering balance, in that case, if he went public right away?           -- that goes to Government misconduct, under your theory, right?                And I fire them, because I think that's not appropriate to put in a memo.           They have a first- amendment claim, right?           Well, they disagree with it.     They think it's -- whatever -- unprincipled, wrong. They write me a memo, and I say, "Don't write me a memo like that."          And they write me another one, and then I fire them.             And they think it's Government misconduct because of the way cases are decided, and that they have a first amendment interest. What could be more important than how the Court decides cases?       And that violates their first-amendment rights.             But there was --             -- a dispute about that in this case, too.           I mean, it -- under the supervisor's view, it may come down to simply whether there were tire tracks or tire rim tracks.                 And that's not as serious, in one view, as your client thinks it's serious.            Some of them --            -- in fact, don't cover disclosures that are job related.                 If it's the employee's job to blow the whistle on this type of thing, it's usually not covered by a whistleblower statute.            I guess I'm --            -- thinking of the Federal law, where the idea is, if it's part of your job, you have the normal civil-service job protections if you're being retaliated or discriminated against for doing your job, so you don't get the extra protections of the whistleblower law.          The only people who get it are the people who -- it is not part of their job.              Yeah.   Thank you, Ms. Robin-Vergeer.

DROZDOWSKI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              Why isn t the rolling of the eyes a persuasive reason?                So you re --             Well, isn t this just another way of saying you don t believe the proffered justification?           In other words, the -- the trial judge made a credibility determination that that was the reason, the person rolled her eyes, and you re saying, in light of the other explanations, you think the prosecutor is just making that up.           So you re saying you don t believe it.        You think there s a different reason, and the rolling the eyes is not the real reason.        And we have a factual determination that the judge believes that that s the reason or a reason.                 And under the -- the statute, at least that -- that s -- that either has to be shown to be unreasonable or, under the State s reason, that s presumed to be correct, and you have to show it by clear and convincing evidence.           And you would say you ve established that by clear and convincing evidence?              Juror 19 -- you just said earlier the fact that the one juror s uncle had an alcohol problem was -- was a legitimate factor.                Juror 19 s daughter had a -- a cocaine problem and this was a cocaine case.            Isn t that a perfectly legitimate reason for exercising a peremptory with respect to a juror?              Maybe I m -- what -- what is the inference you try to draw from the treatment of juror 19?           That the prosecutor wants to -- was striking people on the basis of their race or that she had better reasons for 19 than 16?           And then what do you do with the fact that juror 19 s daughter had a cocaine problem and this was a cocaine case?                   That doesn t seem to be -- that s not a race-based reason.                   That s seems to me to be a good reason.           What do you do with the argument that your reading of the two sections means that (e)(1) would only apply in a very small number of cases, and it s obvious that Congress was trying to tighten the habeas review procedures?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN LICHTENSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT           Well, let's take that last one first, if you don't mind, since the argument is that you've waived that argument by not -- not raising it below.           No.    The --           -- the allegation I'm looking for -- and I -- I guess you probably didn't -- you didn't have to raise it below, given the state of the Ninth Circuit law I would suppose.                  But in your brief in opposition, where is it raised that this interferes with the contract between you and -- between MCDonald and JWM?           But coming here, I would have thought our rules say that if you're going to rely on this as a ground for affirmance here, we should see it in the brief in opposition.           Here.            Both Sullivan and Shaare Tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases. Right?            Not 1981 cases.              Thank you, counsel.
04-597 +++$+++            Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Schroeder. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. SCHROEDER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT           Well, but if they had been on --           -- if they had been on notice that insufficiency of the evidence was going to be an issue, they might have put more in the record about the sufficiency of the evidence.            Well, why -- it's -- why is that a lesser remedy?            It's just different.         I mean, remittitur is a lesser remedy, too, but you don't say, "Well, if you've made a motion for a new trial, and then that falls by the wayside, you -- the court can do remittitur."              The approach seems to be, "Something's wrong here, and we have to do something, so what is it that we can do?"        And you look around, "Well, maybe we can give them a new trial, or maybe we can have a remittitur."                          But there are different motions for all these different things, and, if they haven't been made, they seem to be off the board.               But the problem there is still the same.              Whatever it is that gave rise to the motion to dismiss as a sanction -- the misconduct by counsel -- you're still addressing that same problem.                          But a new trial addresses different issues than a judgment as a matter of law, and remittitur addresses different issues than a new trial.           It's an extreme case, because there's insufficient evidence?           Well, it's --           -- not going to be plain error in every insufficient-evidence case.            Thank you, Counsel.

04-623 +++$+++             Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Atkinson. ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                Well, the relationship between the States and the Federal Government has changed a little since Gibbons versus Ogden. [Laughter.]          Well, that begs the question -- if you had said "this specific subject," the regulation of controlled substances, your answer would have come out the other way, which is kind of what the case is about.          Well, but let's -- but the supposition is that the State legal judgment is that that's the wrong characterization, that it's legitimate medical practice to make patients feel better, and morphine does that; and so, the State can allow them to prescribe morphine to make people feel better.               And I understand your position to be that that would be permissible?          That could not -- that's not prohibited under the Controlled --          -- Substances Act.             What does that do to the effectiveness of regulation under the Controlled Substances Act?           If one State can say it's legal for doctors to prescribe morphine to make people feel better, or to prescribe steroids for bodybuilding, doesn't that undermine the uniformity of the Federal law and make enforcement impossible?            Well, that may or --            -- may not be true.      But focus on the particular question.                  If you have one State that allows the use of a drug that the Federal Government has determined is illegal, and is illegal everywhere else because other States haven't done it, how is the Federal Government supposed to enforce that prohibition?            I'm trying to get at the specific enforcement point.                If you have one State that allows morphine to be used legally for --            -- recreational purposes, how is the Federal Government supposed to enforce the prohibition on that elsewhere?          Well, what do you do with regulation 1306, which -- the one that, of course, talks about "legitimate medical purpose"?               That was promulgated in 1971.         It wasn't directed to the Oregon statute.         And yet it suggests that the Attorney General has the authority to interpret that phrase.               You had a --               -- second answer?               I'm sorry.     You had a second answer?           Well, but in 1971 Congress didn't assume the States were going to pass legislation for use of drugs to assist with suicide, either.
04-631 +++$+++             Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Gershengorn. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN HEATH GERSHENGORN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT               But that's just a subsequent deduction.               I mean, if we get income, we're taxed on it.              If we make a charitable contribution, we get a deduction.              But that doesn't mean we don't have to pay and are subject to the income tax.               Where is --           -- where is it?           But that --           -- works with the income tax, too.          You have casualty losses and things like that. It turns out you were subject to the tax, but you don't have to pay it, because you get a deduction.                  But that doesn't mean you're not subject to it in the first place.               Well, the statute says --               -- the statute says it's a tax on the sale, but then it goes on and says it's the first sale, and the first sale is to the distributor, and that's why the incidence of the tax is on him.          But nobody -- but it's not sold -- it's not taxed twice.                If it's sold to a distributor, that distributor has to pay the tax.                     The distributor then sells it to someone else.                    That someone else doesn't have to pay the tax.            Counsel, did I understand your earlier discussion, about the department store, to suggest that if the tribe had the tanker truck, and they picked up the fuel and then brought it back, that, in that case, you have no objection to the tax, even though the economic incidence and effect is going to be the same?               Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES           Well, why isn't it the sale between whoever is selling it to the distributor and the distributor?               But none of this -- none of this mattered to the tenth circuit, though, did it?                       I mean, they didn't care where the incidence was.                    They just went right into the balancing, right?               And you think that was wrong.

We do have a Federal rule and a limitation, and (d)(2) is an exception for time that it's pending before the State Courts.                       And if the State Courts aren't going to bother to tell us whether something's timely or not, or pending, giving them a blank check does undermine the Federal interest behind the 1-year limitation period.                Why do you think the Federal statute necessarily imports a State standard? It says that the State postconviction proceeding must be pending.           And California presents an unusual situation, but we interpret that pending is a question of Federal law.           It's not a State standard.              Thank you --
04-759 +++$+++               Thank you, Ms. Maynard. Mr. Cotter. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. COTTER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS   In the -- in the face of a district court opinion that applied the Good Samaritan statute and threw the case out because no allegation could be made to come within the Good Samaritan statute.                  So, it seems pretty clear that they're doing something quite different from what you're suggesting.               But, doesn't that approach -- it doesn't make any sense, because you're only looking at half of the equation.                    Presumably, if you have a special set of principles for governmental actors, they include immunities and defenses and all that.                         And you just want the benefit of the liability, but you don't want, I take it, the immunities and defenses that go along with it.           Well, doesn't that make it a contract case?          If you're talking about the party who's contracted with, say, a private inspector -- I mean, I have a contract, somebody comes and inspects the house for termites, and I assume, if they don't do a good job and the house is damaged, they're liable.                But that's under contract, and this is a question of tort liability.           Well, but only -- presumably, only if they meet the requirements of the Good Samaritan law.           Which -- they would have to show that there was an increase in the risk of harm, which I think it would not be true in your hypothetical, or that there was a duty owed to the third party -- the scaffolding inspector is presumably hired by the contractor, not by the employees -- or there was reliance.               So, we're just debating now whether or not you've satisfied the requirements of the Good Samaritan statute.               Did you argue -- I mean, you lost in the district court on the Good Samaritan statute.           On your appeal, did you argue that that was wrong?
04-805 +++$+++                Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Alioto. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH M. ALIOTO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS               So if they had combined and if they had agreed in the joint venture to sell a new brand of gasoline, Equilon gasoline, of course, they would -- the joint venture would be free to set the price of that.               So if that's correct -- if -- if that's correct, what is the difference if the joint venture decides that it's going -- they're going to make more money having two separate brands and even though it's Equilon gas, the people are going to think it's different because some people have always bought from Texaco and others from Shell?                   It's not going to affect how the profits are distributed.                     It's still going to be the same whether it's Equilon gas or Texaco and Shell.             Why does the joint venture lose the authority to set the price of its product?              I concede that it would have been perfectly legal for them to do that if they called all of their gasoline Equilon gasoline because they owned all the gas and the profits are going to be distributed to the owner the same way whether they call them Texaco or Shell.                  Why is it suddenly different because they put different labels on the -- keep different labels on the gasoline?              I don't understand that.       I mean, now you're backing away from your concession.            If you have a lawful joint venture that's marketing a product, the joint venture has to be able to set the price of the product.              No.      No, if it's -- if it's a lawful joint venture and it's selling gasoline -- there's no retaining of prior brands -- the joint venture sets the price.                  And if the -- and all those people you said suffered when Equilon did this, those same number of people would have suffered if they're selling Equilon gasoline at a price determined by the joint venture.              It seems to me a very artificial hook that you're trying to hang your case on, which is they retained for presumably legitimate brand competition reasons their separate brands, but that was the decision of the joint venture.                       And again, the joint venture has to be able to price its product whether it's sold as Equilon or whether it's sold as Texaco or Shell under -- under the same -- same joint venture.               Thank you, Mr. Alioto.

MILLETT ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS          And what if it's for --            Well, are you talking about --            You're talking about letters, though, right?             I mean, I -- they -- is FedEx and UPS in the neighborhood when you're talking about packages --            -- of the size that have to be left --            -- on the porch?            Right.              Well, what's the Postal Service number for large packages?              Yes.           But if the --           But if the postman throws the box onto the porch and hits somebody there, you say that's within the exception?           But you don't say, "Hey, you hit me with the mail," right?                 You say, "You hit me with a box."              Your claim --              -- arises out of how he handled the box, just like --              -- in the other case it arises out of how he handled the vehicle.                   You don't care whether it's the mail or not.                  By the same token, when you trip over something -- a box -- you don't care whether it's a mail box or if it's the box from UPS.                   And yet, in your case, it makes all the difference in the world.              Yes.              Right.           I suppose your --           -- defense affects the process.         In other words, you would, more and more, be leaving those -- the little slips of paper saying, "Go down to the Post Office and pick up your package," rather than leaving the package on the porch.            -- packages.

04-885 +++$+++              Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Lewis. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KIM MARTIN LEWIS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT             Well, it's the same problem in the patent area, isn't it?               And yet, in the Florida Prepaid cases, we've enforced the sovereign immunity with respect to patent proceedings.          Your waiver argument is -- is it under 106(b) or 106(c)?            It's beyond both of those, isn't it?         That's an abrogation, that's not --         -- a waiver.         Well, my question would be, How can you argue in favor of waiver when you have a statute with a much more limited waiver, the limits in 106(b) and 106(c), and you're saying, "Well, they waived it much more broadly"?        It would seem to me that the most you can argue is that there was a waiver under 106(b) or 106(c), but that doesn't get rid of the whole case.          How do we interpret the statute to establish that Congress intended the States to waive their immunity with the filing of the claim?                  I don't see that anywhere in the statute.          You're arguing that by filing the claim, the State has waived all of its immunity, but I don't see where in the statute it imposes that kind of waiver upon States.         I see where they abrogate the immunity, but that's different than saying that there's a waiver.                  Is your argument that just because they abrogated immunity, and it turned out they didn't -- may or may not have that authority, they necessarily imposed a waiver?         Okay.    Well, then where is the waiver of sovereign immunity in this statute?         But I thought -- you're not relying on 106(b) and 106(c).         So, where is the waiver of immunity on which you're relying?         But you have no argument that Congress imposed a waiver.         Okay.         Well, how do you -- how do you have an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate?         In other words, the Federal Government is saying, under your theory, that we're abrogating your immunity.        And the State's saying, "You don't have that authority."         And how do you get an informed waiver, simply because the State participates in a bankruptcy proceeding, on the basis of the legal theory that they're asserting here today, that Congress doesn't have the authority to abrogate the immunity?          I understand that.   But your theory, as I read in your brief, as an alternative argument, is that there was a --          -- waiver.   The State waived its immunity by participating through -- in the --          -- bankruptcy proceeding. How is there an informed waiver if the argument is over the authority to abrogate?          Yes, but all the -- all the statute does is abrogate.          In 106(a).     It's --          -- an attempt to --          -- abrogate.          And if it turns out that Congress doesn't have that authority, I don't see how you can say the State has made an informed waiver, when their theory is, "Guess what?         You don't have that authority to abrogate."         I think we're -- I think it's safe.         It's a trick they play on new Chief Justices all the time. [Laughter.]         We're even -- yeah, we're even more in the dark now than before. [Laughter.]              Well, to what extent was this argument raised below, I guess is a --             So, the -- so, the long and short of it is, for good and sufficient reasons you did not make the same waiver below that you're making here today.             Okay.

I thought the Volvo policy was, if you had two dealers competing for the same sale, they gave the same discount to each dealer.          But there's never -- but, in those situations, there's never two purchases, there's always one -- there's only one completed purchase.         But that was for a resale to -- that was for resale to different purchasers.         Nobody's buying two --         -- nobody's buying two trucks from two different purchasers.          Mr. Phillips, when you lose --          If I may.   When you lose a sale, it's because Volvo didn't give you a big enough discount. It's not because they gave another Volvo dealer a bigger discount.         Well, sure, but, I mean, that's -- I mean, long term -- of course, Volvo can terminate you, as a dealer, tomorrow.          And --         Well --         -- well, what -- but it -- under the Robinson-Patman Act, it can.         The classic --         -- case that the Robinson-Patman Act is directed to is when you lose sales because they're giving bigger discounts to other sellers.                  And that's just not the case here.         But Volvo's interest may be in as -- making as much money off of sales this year, and they may not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller, are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years.           You're not at the whim of a monopoly seller.          You mentioned to me just a little while ago, you've got a contract with them.              You can put in that contract whatever you want about pricing.            What do you do with the policy argument -- at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather than the trees -- that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer competition in interbrand -- in the interbrand market, rather than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed to protect the intrabrand position?          Your argument that focuses on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing those sales at all.         I mean, if you -- you had made all the sales, but you still thought you should have gotten a bigger discount that would have allowed you to make more money, you'd have the same argument, right?         Oh, no, you just go back and look again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody else was getting a bigger discount -- if you had gotten the bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to be a dealer for a longer time.

I mean, the question is what the Oregon Supreme Court did, and it's quite clear that it based its decision on the eighth amendment, not these various provisions of Oregon evidence law.              You argue in -- an eighth amendment case in the Supreme Court, you win on the eighth amendment, then you leave the courthouse and say, "Well, I don't want it anymore," and you think that moots the case?              It's still a decision, binding in this case, giving you the right to admit any evidence on residual doubt in the retrial.              But you don't question, or doubt, that the State Supreme Court decision was based on the eighth amendment.              Okay.              So you --                It said that your alibi defense, that had been rejected by the prior jury, was relevant under the eighth amendment.                Okay.                That --                -- that brings up a question I have.              Particularly under the resentencing provision, it looks like the sentencing trial is going to be just a rerun of the guilt trial, because your main evidence that you want to put in is alibi evidence, "I didn't do it."                    So, you're going to say, "Here's" -- the mother is going to say, "I -- he was at home."       And then, presumably, the State gets to put on all of its witnesses, saying, "No, here are the people who saw him do it," and blah, blah, blah.                      And so, it's just the same trial all over again.              You want to put that in?                 Any new -- any new evidence relevant to alibi or degree of guilt.                And you -- and you want to retain the right to put in whatever evidence is relevant on those questions.                Well, then what was all the discussion about the mother's having -- then, when you go back, you can put on anything, whether it was presented before, or not, right?                        Because the eighth amendment requires that, according to the Oregon Supreme Court.                Okay.           Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Williams, you have 2 minutes remaining.

Well, Knights involved a situation where reasonable suspicion was required, so it addressed the problem that Mr. Long has of unbridled discretion.            You still had to have an articulable reasonable suspicion with respect to the individual.           Why -- and why was his expectation of privacy severely diminished?           Because of the very practice that's being challenged here today, right?           Because he saw something -- you -- he signed something that said, "You're subject to searches."              Well, that's what is at issue.       It seems to me that it's -- I guess I've said it before, he's -- it's begging the question to say, "You can do this, because he has a diminished expectation of privacy."            How far do you push this? Can you have parolees come in and take a lie-detector test every week?         Do they have -- do they have diminished expectation with respect to their Fifth Amendment rights?           Was that a yes, you can have them --           You can.           What about --           What about --           Does it depend -- I mean, what if he's on parole for transporting drugs in balloons from bus stations?

DOUGLAS RICHARDS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                    But where does it set forth agreement?                    Temporal, geographic, the identities, but where does it set forth anything evincing an agreement other than the allegation of parallel conduct?                    Do you have any, is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the parallel conduct?                    And what does that consist of?                  So it states -- would it state an antitrust violation if had you a grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet store on the other corner of the block and you say, well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies and they could make money if they did, therefore that's an antitrust violation?                  That's all the facts that are alleged.                  So then when we get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion based upon your prior allegations, it's not an independent allegation of an agreement.                It's saying because of this parallel conduct, because we think it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they have agreed.                   But it's a statement of a conclusion based upon your allegations that precede it.                   It's not a statement that independently there apart from all of this, there's an agreement.                    But how do you tell?   I mean, companies get proposals all the time. Here's a way you could make more money.                   You could all enter the market in some foreign country.                 The people decide, I mean, life is short and they've got certain objectives, and they don't have to do everything that an economist might think is in their economic self interest.        I mean, what is the limiting self interest to that?                   Is it an adequate response for the executive to say, I'm a little risk averse, I want to see how things work out over the next five years.   They keep changing the laws, the regulatory environment.        That's why I didn't jump in and compete?                    But you don't think you have to prove that either?                     I mean, you don't think you have to prove anything more than what you've alleged in the complaint about the background context, the parallel conduct?                   Well, how would it be focused if you're talking about whether it's in their economic interest?         You would have to say why, why didn't you enter into this particular realm of competition and they would say, well because we were doing other things.     We had other areas that we were focusing on.   And they would have to document all that to your satisfaction.

MARSHALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                      How do we, how does that factor in on the issues that are before us, the weakness of the mitigating evidence?                      In what way are we supposed to assess it?         We don't have a harmless error question in these cases.                   So your argument is that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by, reasonable consideration was not precluded by the instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?                  And that depends on the nature of the evidence, I take it?                    I mean, if the evidence we were talking about was biological predisposition to violence, that's only going to point in one direction, right?          I mean, if the evidence is isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well, that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.                  And so when you get into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to outgrow it?    Do we make that determination in every case based on the particular evidence and the particular arguments that counsel made?

And the court said we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then when it turns out that they got it wrong and there was error they had to apply harmless error review. In Texas law, harmless error review turns on the standard whether there was an objection or not, and they went back and said there was no objection.                The contrary assertions assumes that when they let the claim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance on objection for any purposes, not consideration on the merits, but also for any eventual later consideration on harmless error pursuant to the established State standard.

05-1157 +++$+++                    Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Lovell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LOVELL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   What about the Solicitor General's suggestion about extending antitrust immunity to a single IPO?           In other words, what's wrong with that?   That's where the SEC's regulation seems to be most pervasive, and what you can do in the context of an IPO if your allegations cut across IPOs that might be different.                   What are you talking about when you say a horizontal agreement?                  Are you talking about a group of underwriters in the context of a single IPO?                   No.                   I'm trying to grasp the difference between the single IPO and multiple.                   So in response to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, they all agree in the context of a single IPO, let's make sure everyone's going to hold the stock for a month, and you say no problem.                   Well, if the same underwriters get together the next month, they've got a different IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same thing we did last time because seemed to work well in terms of the issuance and the capital formation.                All of a sudden that's an antitrust problem?                   So your test is it has to be prohibited by the securities laws?                   What do you say to the -- sort of stepping back from the trees to the forest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been tightening up the requirements for private securities litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent Congress's regulation.                   But the problem -- the problem is that, of course, these people are to some extent under the securities laws in the business of fixing prices.    They get together as a syndicate, a syndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what price we're going to charge for this initial public offering.    It looks, if you didn't understand the context, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust violation. And the problem is, I guess, that -- that when you take that type of evidence, the type of evidence you're going to be relying on to show that there's price fixing, it is exactly what the SEC wants the people to do.    They want them to get together.                They want them to agree on an appropriate IPO price that's going to contribute to capital formation and everything else. And how do you at, as Justice Alito pointed out, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court supposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this isn't the good price fixing?                  How did they applaud them?                   The SEC which is the agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks otherwise.                   They don't think these, the antitrust actions are good for the securities markets.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                      I suppose it would make a difference to the officers, a principle of equitable tolling.      They don't know if they're going to be sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long.                    Under an accrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're going to be facing a civil action or not.                   They're not going to waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in state court.     I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not like they're looking for cases.                They're going to say in most cases:     Stay granted, come back when this is over. They don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter whether they're precisely right or wrong.                   I mean, if it's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to me there's much prejudice from that.
05-1256 +++$+++                  Thank you, Mr. Frey. Mr. Peck. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  -- you object to in this instruction.    I mean, and I thought our cases clearly established that you can consider the harm to others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the conduct.   You don't disagree with that?                  On the other hand, you cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the defendant for those harms particularly in a case where the defendant might have defenses available with respect to those others.    So I understood what the instruction sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to others.                   Well, because the instructions indicate and juries often do this that punitive damages are certain multiple of the compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are saying.   In determining what that multiple should be you consider whether they have harmed others.                 And this instruction would make all the difference to the world in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about. If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say, well, there is however many, a thousand other people in the plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the conduct is a thousand times more reprehensible.              There is a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple when you get this kind of instruction.                  One way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in Oregon to the jury:       "How many people do you see outside driving home smoking cigarettes?"                 Now, that type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess reprehensibility.     On the other hand, with the instruction that was offered the defense counsel could have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for those other people.      We only have one plaintiff before us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with respect to that plaintiff.         But without the instruction you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in Oregon smoking cigarettes?                That has no relevance to the question of the extent to which the defendant is being punished, does it?                   Well, if they can understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that distinction?                  So you think it would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if they had proposed an instruction that said, you may consider the harm to others in assessing how reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had no objection to that instruction?                   Can I make, just to get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive damages precedents?

This information was not even provided to the government, which the statute requires.                   He not only has to have direct and independent knowledge, he has to voluntarily provide that to the government.                   And I understand that the Tenth Circuit, to have relied solely on the document at joint appendix page 605, that's the only thing he provided to the government.                   And all it says is that this design will not work.                 There are a lot of things that don't work, but that doesn't mean there's fraud on the government.         You don't know if they're going to fix it, they're going to change it, use a different design, not make a claim based on that design. Why is that enough to satisfy the statute?                   But he has to -- if the information that he provides isn't direct and independent information of the allegations, it would seem that the statute is not satisfied.                   I don't want to get off my question here but did you -- do you agree that this page JA 605 was the only information that he provided to the government?                    Well, maybe I'd better phrase it differently.             Do you agree that that is the only information on which the Tenth Circuit relied?                    Well, but this -- he has to provide this information before filing an action.                      I would have thought the allegations referred to the public disclosure.                      It talks about public disclosure of allegations, and then says he has to have direct and independent knowledge of the allegations.    So I would assume that's the important linkage.

You found out also that they didn't pay taxes.                    Would he be able to recover for that, because, you know, if they're going to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes. Is that sufficiently connected?                  And it doesn't matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong? Let's say he says -- you have special interrogatories to the jury and his allegation has always been the pondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the wrong kind of cement.      And it turns out it has nothing to do with that at all.        The jury says, no, that's not the reason it failed, it failed for another reason.                   Is that a sufficient connection?

Are the payments under that contract's contributions to an employee benefit plan?              It seems like the consequence of your theory though --               But -- but providing for workers' compensation through insurance, rather than through self-insurance, is also not on the list.              Well, sure, if they have a contract, as part of their -- part of their contract, they get the bottled water, that's -- that's easy to see why that's covered.                  But the -- the question is when it's not.                It's just something that the employer does in the course of his business that has -- that benefits both his business and his workers.                You couldn't have the plan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a plan without the insurance policy.                      It's just a different way of paying for the same thing.           Mr. Verrilli, your -- your friend's argument about the interrelation between (a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one.                What is your answer to that?

But when you look at the complaint in this case, testing is a small part of it.   They're complaining about the modification of the tobacco blend, the weight, rod length, the circumference, use of reconstituted tobacco sheets.                       In other words there's a lot going on here in the complaint here besides the testing.          And if the Government is in no way specifying the tobacco blend, the weight, the length, all these other things that are allegedly part of the manipulation to affect the figures.                    I don't understand your response to Justice Kennedy.                If we determine that you're acting under the direction of a Federal officer, that would seem to me highly pertinent on the merits of a preemption argument.       So it would not be just the forum, but kind of getting into the preemption merits.

Sure.   And -- and he was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case, this is what happens.          It seems to me all you want us to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic paragraph about there are four factors and here they are.           Can I ask you about one factor in particular?            What if by the time you get to the injunction stage, the -- the patent office has, you know, rejected all of the underlying claims in a preliminary way?          It's not final.         Can the district court take that into account in deciding not to issue an injunction?            Right.           Well, that's what struck me as odd there.           Footnote 27 says that's a basis for staying the injunction.                It seems to me if it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis not to issue one in the first place.

You're devaluing the value of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply because the people who infringed it weren't willful, and I wonder why that makes sense.                Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT             We also know by now that the patent office has rejected all of the claims of the patent.           The staff.           Is that a factor that a district court could take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction?           Say the injunction question came up right now, today.                 Could the district court say, well, the patent office staff has rejected every claim of this patent, and I'm going to take that into account in deciding whether to put eBay out of business?            Mr. Waxman, you mentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that we're dealing with a troll, you described -- what exactly is the invention here?            Electric.      I mean, it's not like --            -- he invented the, you know, internal combustion engine or anything.                     It's very vague I think, and this is one of the considerations --               -- the district court mentioned.          The exact parameters of when it was going to be infringed and when it wasn't were amorphous.                      And so isn't that a factor the district court can take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction because it's going to be hard to issue an injunction to define exactly when it's going to be violated and when it's not?               I may not be a software developer, but as I read the invention, it's displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying them.       I -- I might have been able to do that.            Well, but the patent office staff has rejected all the claims.                 I don't know on what grounds.
05-1342 +++$+++                   But you have a subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage lending business that are not associated with national banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the regulation that their competitors are subject to.                    Is that right?                  And that's fine, and they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says they're, they're exempt from regulation.                     The question is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies is immune from the regulation that those other companies --                  Justice Breyer's questions were pointing out, to the extent your regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going to prevail.    The question is whether or not you are immune from State regulation across the board --                     One of those laws might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them a disclosure about how much they're going to end up paying over the life of the loan and all that.                      And they require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in Michigan.    Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?                   Isn't -- isn't your friend correct then?       You are really trying to have your cake and eat it, too.       You're saying if we did this without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that. But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to other people.                     What authority do you have for the proposition that when then Federal law says subject to the same terms and conditions that they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the same Federal regulation that applies to the national banks?                      Was 7.4006 issued pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?                      Yes.    Or did it predate that?                   How does it conflict with Federal banking authority for the State to audit the books of the mortgage subsidiary?                   Take my earlier case about the consumer disclosure.             Michigan has a law, I assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the consumer all this information.             Would that conflict with the authority of a national bank?                   So you think any regulation would conflict with the national bank status?                   Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUSCURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS                     It's field preemption when it comes to regulation.                   Yes, if the bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to apply for enforcing a contract.              But you're claiming field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?                  State laws generally -- State agencies generally don't regulate national banks at all, right?                   That was an effort of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging in the activity, correct?                   That's an obvious case of conflict preemption.            Here we have a question of whether or not the State can regular the operating subsidiary to any extent.                   Why should we assume that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.                    Is there any aspect of state law, including liability limitation, that they want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary chartered under state law, Michigan or another state, and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state regulations?
05-1345 +++$+++                       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cahill. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. CAHILL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Call it a cable TV franchise fee.    I mean, isn't that the way municipalities used to make a lot of money?                  They charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise and then grant a monopoly in exchange.                  To get back to the public-private distinction, what is the answer to Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to -- what if you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent privately owned company?          Is that covered by the Commerce Clause cases or not?                   So then, the Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we would develop federal law about what's appropriate for municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate? We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste facilities but not to run milk pasteurization.                   I don't know how we would do that.                   Well, if we accepted that argument, we would treat the public services just like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring private companies.      You're the one that's arguing for special treatment based on public ownership.                   But the whole point is these are not unique.           The whole point is there are private companies that provide these kinds of services. Maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are not unique.    But you can't say that this is a unique service being provided by government.                  Thank you, Mr. Cahill. Ms. Halligan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN ON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                     Well, there is an allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue particular economic goals that the municipality has.                   If only facilities on your side of the case that are traditional municipal services, but then this seems to be at the borderline. I mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases or the milk processing cases.             How do we decide whether this is one of the traditional governmental services, the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these that looks more like regular market participation?                      Where do you, where do you come out on the 50-50 facility?                   Well, I thought you said earlier motive was not the test, in response to I think it was Justice Alito.
05-1429 +++$+++                   Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   I'm not sure I agree, Counsel, that the Fobian rule is both narrower and broader than the question you try to present.                      For example it applies to the claims of a secured creditor for attorneys fees on a secured claim as well.                   Why -- it doesn't?                   So if you're an oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees arising under solely issues of matters of Federal bankruptcy law, the Fobian rule doesn't prevent that?                    Well, not everyone. I'm not clear on it.                    If it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari.                   No, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?                  And if that's true -- and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.                    No.     It's quite unlike the situation, for example in Timbers, where had you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest. There is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees.                   Counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and I -- earlier you told me one had.     Which one in particular?                   So you really want us to reach out and decide a question that's not presented when there has been no holding of the court of appeals one way or the other on the issue?                   If you thought the Fobian rule was wrong, you could have said that.                      That's an added complication.     There's another case on which the Ninth Circuit's based its decision in your case, DeRoche. Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking attorneys' fees.                      So we still have to decide the Fobian issue.           And your failure to defend it here means that we're going to have to decide in on that inadequate record.      If you have mentioned that in an opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the rule that we have to decide.                     Your friend says it's more favorable to say the claims are unimpaired.
05-1448 +++$+++                     Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Clark. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA P. CLARK, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                   But I thought we just heard that the PBGC might look at it a little differently, that they are more comfortable with the annuity insuring that these beneficiaries get their benefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries into a pool with your other union members.                   Doesn't this put you in an awfully difficult position?               I mean, you're representing the union, which has other members besides these beneficiaries, and you're saying even though under their plan the beneficiaries are fully protected with irrevocable annuities, we think they're going to be better off if they're thrown in with our other members and we get the $5 million to spread out, not to these beneficiaries but among all these other members.                 Isn't that an awkward position to be in?                      And beyond as well? I mean, let's say we have 5 million extra dollars here. See, that's what I don't understand.                      If you're saying it's a fiduciary, I mean, how can they make a decision ever to do anything other than just give the five million to the beneficiaries?                      Well, the terms, the plans terms here, did not provide for merger in the event of termination, right?                  Even though the district court decided it?           Usually in a waiver situation it's whether you argued it or whether it was addressed by the court.                  If you're -- if you prevail here -- I mean, the reason we have a case is because the employer overfunded the plan to the tune of $5 million.    If you prevail and they cannot get that back even after fully insuring the benefits for the beneficiaries, employers in the future will be very careful not to put in one penny more than what's required to fund the plan; isn't that right.                   What possible equitable basis does the union have to claim this extra $5 million?                   It's not for these beneficiaries.     It's for all the others.                 It's spread out among this pool in the multiemployer plan.                    These are the employer excess contributions.                    What -- looking at it as an equitable matter, what claim do they have to the extra money?                     Are there a lot of plans that look like that, that if there's extra money, we've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not back to the company?                     The union plan.                   Counsel, your little (ii) that you're relying on begins by saying in accordance with the provisions of the plan, the other solution otherwise provides.           Where in the provisions of the plan does it say that they will consider merger?                   Do you know, is there a particular provision in the plan that says that? Or --                   I don't read in accordance with the way you do.             I read in accordance with to mean provided by the plan.
05-1508 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT                  What's the case that says "unambiguously foreclosed"?                  You begin with an argument that directly cuts against your position.                  They knew how to do it under the -- I assume you're referring to the education finance and incentive grant program?                  Well, they did it there, they didn't do it here.               To me that suggests the opposite of the inference you're trying to draw.                   Which they did not say in this act.                   But for different purposes.    In the one case, in this act we're worried about an extensive Federal presence that has an effect on the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG program it's an entirely different question of equalization.                   Well, maybe let me ask it directly.   If they could so easily just say we incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why didn't they do it here?                   They instead went to the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation methodology is.                   Can I ask, is there a difference legally between a regulation and an appendix to the regulation?                   But you say "incorporated," though.        What it did was it took the language and it did not take --                   No?                   In the EFIG statute?                   But in this statute the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it took language from the regulation; it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix.                    And it didn't do that here?                  I have a conceptual difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way you do it.   You take students and you assign a per-pupil number to each individual student.                      But I would have thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're dealing with LEAs.      They have a per-pupil number because they've got a bunch of pupils.                You take individual students, and you know for example in that school district you don't spend the same amount of money on the kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader.                      And yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same. It's an artificial association.                It makes sense to speak of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs because they have so many pupils, they get so much money, you can do the calculation.                   It doesn't make sense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars.                   He may have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you creating this artificial association and then using, using that methodology?                      And it's only -- the reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a swath of students, the district, that's the way it should be ranked.    When you're ranking it by pupils, maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your methodology would make sense.                   No --                   Well, because it's an absurd hypothetical.        What is the --                       What is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a State?                   Which State has one school district?                   In the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary address that disparity under (b)(ii)?                      In other words, the school district which has only 57 students, it seems to me could be taken out of the calculation under (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more representative school districts, not the special case of the particularly isolated school district or whatever.                   Why do you have to do that?     Why do you have to do it first?                  It says you can take into account this -- extent to which the program reflects additional costs in particular districts.                   Wouldn't the statute have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according to the ranking?   It does tell you to disregard LEAs, which suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.                  I would have thought your office had answered that question in countless briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of the statute and not some unexpressed intent.                      Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Manasevit. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEIGH M. MANASEVIT, ON BEHALF OF STATE RESPONDENT                     Isn't it -- I'm sorry.     Go ahead.                   No.    No.   See, that's my conceptual difficulty.               It is only per pupil when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils. If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which is what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number associated with each pupil.            You have a number.          Nobody knows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend on each individual.     We know how much you give to this district, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil number, and therefore, I would have thought a reference to per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according to district.                   Go ahead.                     Well, that must not be right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any disparity to worry about equalization in the first place.   Right?                   Don't you think Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to go to those particular districts from actually reaching the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant it to go?                    Well, sure, but then the question is whether the State can consider it when they're figuring out how much money to give it.                 So in effect it's diverted.                    Thank you, counsel.

MAYNARD, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                    So why was it so hard for them to say that this is an exclusive remedy, as they have done in other situations?                    That's even all the more reason for them to say.            I mean.         If there's confusion about what remedies are available and they want it to be exclusive, it's easy enough to say that.                    Well, again that suggests that they know how to spell out exclusivity when they have it in mind, and they didn't do it with respect to the availability of an action under 1346.                    So the Williams decision came like a bolt out of the blue, then?                   Mr. Hungar has a further question.                   Mr. Hungar has a further question. (Laughter.)

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                      And is it just an evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the waiver question?                      Well, why did -- the court on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver.                   So why would they then send it back for an evidentiary hearing on waiver?                  Well, but the prior paragraph says it's because of the history of his biological grandfather, biological brother, and biological child.    That suggests to me it's a genetic claim and --                  Well, but he knew about that.    He knew about that mitigating evidence at the trial because his biological mother was there.                  How could that be helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother to testify about drug and alcohol abuse?                  What use would the expert be if the potential predicate --                     The defendant would have been happy to have his biological mother talk with the expert, but was unwilling to have his biological mother say the same thing in court?                  Counsel, do you think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always possible that some additional evidence would come up and you say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have waived it?                   You can't give a yes answer to whether it's ever possible.                   Okay.                  Well, he certainly understood that.   He said if you want to give me the death penalty, bring it on, I'm ready for it.                 The purpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the imposition of the death penalty.               He says bring it on.                   Why isn't the type of documentation that would be sufficient?                   He understands what the consequence of not putting mitigating evidence on is going to be.                   What is established? That you've satisfied (e)(2)?                  Why, because you satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?                  I'm sorry, you'll just have to bear with me.                  So you're saying you satisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of diligence.   Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B), which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty, in other words words subject to --                   What do you do with -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the dissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the mitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, "genetic predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its aggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was undeterable and even from prison would present a future danger"?                   That was presented in the State court proceedings.                   The biological mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.

WEST, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                   And I thought that approach was exactly what we held was required in the Street decision, the International Association of Machinists versus Street, so that you can't get around this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use the others for that.                   Doesn't that objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?                    Why isn't that a content-based restriction?           You've got to look at it and see if it's germane.                    That's the argument that the State Supreme Court in footnote 6 expressly said you did not raise.                    Well surely, they get to make that decision, don't they?                   Under the statute, it's their decision whether or not -- you don't get to say, well, this is in your interests, or whether you'd want to spend the money or not.                   Well, you're free under this system to send them the same sort of materials you send about your PAC and say we do all sorts of good things with the money from people who opt in, you should opt in.

05-1629 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Meade. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                     Your friend began his argument by saying you don't defend the decision of the Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting.                  Is that correct?                     I know the judgment, but you focused at least primarily on other grounds than the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied. Is he correct that you concede that merely because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical treatment?                   That was the third reference to the Model Penal Code, so I have to ask.                      No one's enacted the Model Penal Code, have they?                   Would you describe the Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence of general law?                      Is that what joyriding is?   That when you're done with your joy ride, you return the car where you picked it up?                   I thought they just abandoned it wherever you happen to be.                      What's the joy in that? (Laughter.)                   Do you understand that point to be what the Ninth Circuit relied on?                   So if we decided on the question, the aiding and abetting question, they did decide this would available to you to argue on remand?                   Because you presented it to the Ninth Circuit below.                  Well, they say you cannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are charged as such, and that the documents show he was charged as a principal.                    Well, the Government -- it is not only that.        The Government has authority going the other way.      People versus Prado, "in the absence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must be indicted and convicted as such."                     If you look at this information, it's clear that he's not being indicted as an accessory after the fact.                  Has anyone ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?                     But if no one has ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to construe this charging document which charges him as a principal as actually meaning to charge him as an accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?                  Your argument isn't limited to theft offenses, correct?                     That would cut across all of these areas in which the federal law refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?                     It would mean we could not rely on the categorical approach in almost any of those cases?                     Yeah, the categorical approach.                     Yes, sir.

05-1631 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Jones. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                    Is there any doubt that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious injury to the other cars on the highway that he was passing?                    We are not talking about driving in violation of traffic laws.                  We talking about 90 miles an hour on a two-lane highway, swerving past cars in the incoming traffic --                    Hitting -- after hitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on.                  That's a little more than just unsafe.                   The Eleventh Circuit gave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which if you're looking at what the -- was clearly established law from the point of view of the officer that provides him guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a result in the use of deadly force in the police chase case involving an automobile.                  So when Officer Scott was trying to figure out what the law was, he should have relied on the dissent in the case?                   Go ahead.   Finish your --                      If I could just get back to an earlier point.            You think what the officer should have done in this case was to let Mr. Harris go.                      Even though he doesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to arrest him later.     He doesn't know if it's a stolen car or not.                      And he doesn't know why he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or terrorism or anything else.                   Once they have gotten away, I assume.                      And aren't you concerned that that creates an incentive in every case for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the police are going to have to give up eventually?                      Well, Garner -- Garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the back, right?

VLADECK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS               Mr. Vladeck, let me just give you a purely hypothetical situation.                           Let's suppose that the conferees can't agree whether expert fees should be included.                 Some think they should; some think they shouldn't.               And somebody suggests a compromise.              The compromise is we won't put it in the statute, but we'll put it in the report and we'll let the courts figure it out. What should happen in that situation?                Well if that's not this case, what in the world prevented the conferees from putting something as important in this context as expert fees, as I understand it, probably more important than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them from putting that in the statute if that clearly was their intent?           I was going to say it certainly had the meaning in Federal -- the Federal court context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial Code.             Where is that set forth?             Thank you.           Well, but if you conclude that the statute is ambiguous, what do you do with the Spending Clause problem?                We've said that when you're imposing conditions in Spending Clause legislation, you have to do that unambiguously.               It's what the Court said in -- in Pennhurst.           If it's ambiguous, if the availability of expert fees, which is the big- ticket item in these things, not the attorneys' fees, States are not unambiguously on notice that they're accepting that liability when they take the funds.                Well, even if it is not the big-ticket item --                -- it still has to be -- it still has to be unambiguously set forth in Spending Clause legislation.                Why were the earlier versions that included that expressly then not -- why didn't they make it through to the final version?                Now, we've slid back from the joint statement to the statement of one Member on the floor now.             Counsel, if I could interrupt you.           As I understood it, this gets back to where you started.          Your position is that if this same scenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986, that your position would not be the same.                  In other words, you said -- your suggestion was that it was the legal context at the time in '86 that governed what Congress thought the effectiveness of its statements in committee reports would be.               Maybe I'm ascribing one of the Justice's views to you.

STOCK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT           And I suppose that the preemption provision would apply equally if this were brought in State court or Federal court.                Correct?           But -- but the preemption provision, at least with respect to the rights of Empire, would ensure uniformity.               In other words, if the contract terms preempt State law, then any impediment to recovery by Empire that varies from State to State would be overridden.           No, I understand that.       But to the extent people are concerned about disuniformity from the point of view of the Federal recovery, the preemption provision is going to apply whether this action is in State court or Federal court.           But the only question that we're considering today is whether or not Federal question jurisdiction exists to authorize bringing this suit in Federal court.               Well, they've already said that.          I mean, there would be Federal jurisdiction there because the Federal Government would be a party to the case.             Right?

I know what we said in De Grandy, but I mean how -- I mean, you talk about the south and west Texas.               I mean, on the other hand, 23 and 25 are actually not that close together.                    So how do we know that we should be looking at all the way from El Paso to the Gulf, as opposed to a narrower area?               But I didn't understand Ms. Perales' argument to concern section -- district 25 at all.           And why was that?              Do you have a -- a section 5 argument with respect to district 25 as opposed to a section 2 argument involving district 23?              Is it permissible for a legislature concerned with section 5 to take race and ethnicity in account -- into account in drawing a district?           Go ahead.   I'm sorry.

And I gather that that's not considered a Hispanic opportunity district because of lower voting turnout, registration, participation?              How do we tell when something is being done to make it look like a Hispanic district and, instead, when it's being done for the opportunity of providing a Hispanic opportunity district if voter turnout and registration are increased?           Jump in whenever you want. (Laughter.)             You're talking about district 25.           Right?           Why did they have -- why did have just 50.3 percent?

GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE            Counsel, in -- in the absence of any suggestion that the collective bargaining process is also infected with sex discrimination, why can't we rely on that process to give some basis to the job descriptions?                 In other words, forklift operator was not a separate job from rail yard employee, and if the union wanted to make them separate jobs, they could negotiate that, but they didn't.        So why -- why do we regard that as a material change when you're doing one part of a job as opposed to another part of a job?               Well, but the difference there is that's an employer unilaterally. We don't have that here.               The employer is dealing with the union.          If the jobs really were that different, the union would categorize them differently and negotiate for that.            Doesn't your approach require an employer to keep shuffling the employees around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession of particular types of job responsibilities?            With respect to the suspension, what -- what if she had been -- during the process of investigation, she had been allowed to stay on the job with pay?           In other words, the facts are the same.       It's just that the -- the sort of stay process works the other way and she's not relieved until the end of the company's investigation.                    Is the initiation of that an materially adverse employment action?                 Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Donati. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. DONATI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 What if she'd been operating the forklift for only a week and then she was reassigned?              Would that still be discrimination under any standard?                 Counsel, you said earlier that the act -- one of the protections against trivial charges was that the act had to be the act of the employer.              If the employer sets up a review system in which the final act of the employer is the decision, why is a preliminary charge, initial suspension, review -- why are those also considered acts of the employer?                 What does that mean, it was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement?          Presumably you paid -- the person who did that was paid wages pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.             Right.            Your position is that it would be an -- it would be a covered employment action even if none of that were true, she didn't lose pay, she didn't lose benefits, so long as there was the initiation of the disciplinary action.                 You regard that as sufficiently adverse under 704.                 Other than eligibility for punitive damages.            What -- what if she operated the forklift usually 3 out of 5 days, and the other 2 days was pulling up the rail ties and -- and the shift was now she does -- operates the forklift 2 out of 5 days and 3 out of 5 days she's pulling up rail ties?       Is that materially adverse?               Thank you, counsel.

COLEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              Well, if I can just stop you there.           Your -- your friend on the other side cites the many common law cases not allowing subrogation in this sort of situation, or if it does allow it, subject to the make-whole doctrine.           Well, instead of looking for an equitable counterpart, this is an action for money you think is owing to you under a contract. Why isn't that a classic form of legal relief?           So why did you cite the contract in your complaint?           If equity -- if the equitable subrogation claim were subject to the make- whole doctrine or -- or these other equitable doctrines, and your contractual claim is not, which relief are you entitled to?             The -- the one subject to the equitable doctrines or the relief that's specified in your contract?           Is your claim subject to the equitable doctrines or subject to the legal contractual claim?           Counsel, it seems to me you -- you must be biting your -- your tongue here. There's an easy answer to Justice Stevens and to Justice Scalia, and it's that we get all the money first because that's what the contract says.                    But you can't give that answer because then it starts to look like a legal claim. Instead, you get mired in all these obscure equitable doctrines because you're -- when there's a simple answer there in black and white, but it's in the contract.           And as soon as you say that, it starts to sound legal rather than equitable.               Your theory is that your argument would be exactly the same if you did not have this provision in your contract.                      It's an equitable claim.             It's an age-old subrogation right. You just sue in equity saying, look, I paid the medical expenses, I'm entitled to it.                  You don't need the contractual provision at all.                Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Mr. Feldman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT              How is this -- to go to your first point, how is this specifically identifiable?            No court has said that there's this -- you only want the medical expenses, and no court has said there's this much for medical expenses.                      You have to figure out how much of the recovery is allocable to medical expenses.           In fact, already did that.            They cut out some percentage for attorney's fees.                   It's far removed from the traditional sort of res that we deal with in equity.              So we -- how enforced?         I mean, if you're enforcing a contract, you do that legally not equitably.                Are these claims subject to the qualifications that go along with the equitable lien, the make-whole, whatever the applicable rules are?                So that wouldn't apply here because you're relying on the contract.           So what if the plan said -- you know, this is an insurance company.               They don't like litigation -- we are subrogated to double whatever the medical expenses are that we contributed? That's our recovery.          It's an equitable claim, but it's going to be enforced according to the terms of the plan.           But you would still call that an equitable claim?
05-352 +++$+++                 Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            You would require -- if -- if a defendant is on his second choice and he's filed an affidavit saying, you know, the guy did a great job.          I can't think of a way he would have done anything differently.           I was convicted.        I'm perfectly happy with his strategy, but I didn't get my first choice.        You would still require reversal of the conviction in that case.            And -- and if -- if he were not able to afford a -- afford an attorney and one were appointed for him and that lawyer were incompetent, that client would still have to show prejudice.          But in your case, you don't have to show anything at all.            Does a -- someone relying on appointed counsel have the same right?                     Why can't he say to the first person who comes through the door, you know, I've got a -- I'd like to see the others before I make a choice?           Why not?             How many lawyers -- you're talking about a very refined assertion of a constitutional right.            I mean there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lawyers, and what you're saying is that if he doesn't get choice one, choice two is just not going to do, no matter how close, no matter how similar their approaches are going to be.                  It's not like he's, you know, wants a Rolls Royce and he gets a -- you know, whatever -- a Yugo or something.                  He could choose, you know, the next best out of hundreds and hundreds of thousands.               Well, why not?               Well, why not in the case of an acquittal?              There's still a violation of the Sixth Amendment.             Maybe you don't have an appeal, but you have a 1983 action.               Right?      Because your constitutional rights have been violated because, although you won, you didn't win with the counsel of your choice.             And if -- your personal autonomy interests have been quashed.               It wouldn't be harmless under your theory because your theory is that this is giving expression to your personal autonomy. It's not simply for your defense.                  If it were harmless, it would say that it's totally wrapped up in the defense.         But there's another constitutional interest under your theory.              Counsel, I suppose this -- this right applies on appeal as well.                   Right? Somebody says, I want Mr. Fisher to argue my case in the Supreme Court.           I don't want anybody else.          And -- and yet -- and we get motions for admission to our bar pro hac vice.            If we deny one of those, does that violate the Sixth Amendment?              That -- that happens all the time.            That happens, for example, in the case of incompetent counsel.              There's a right to -- to competent counsel.           If you -- if that right is violated, the defendant still has to show prejudice --              -- before he'll get relief.                Some of the --                Some of the concerns about the evidentiary presentation were addressed by the Seventh Circuit and are the reason they adopted a -- a lesser standard than the prejudice standard in -- in Strickland.              Why isn't that adequate to meet those concerns?           Well, but then you wouldn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.                But at that point, the defendant would be well advised to go ahead with trial with his second-choice lawyer.                Right?           Take his chance and then if he -- if he loses, he gets automatic reversal. So why would he do mandamus?           In the government, you're including the court in that.           That's not always true in a Strickland case.             It's often the court that's making the mistakes that the lawyer should have objected to and was incompetent in not doing so.

We'll give you an extra 30 seconds.   Proceed.                 I guess that gets back to the point earlier.        I mean, do you agree with the discussion earlier that this act is not going to prevent abortions?                 What degree of marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to override the State's interest?           I mean, if you have complications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent of the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of the cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to override the State's articulated interest?                   But I thought your submission earlier was that we don't have any record evidence about how often the complications arise, so it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference is in terms of safety under your submission.                 I thought the evidence was that you're looking for a different degree of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if -- and you're looking for a greater degree if you're intending to perform a D&X.                 Is your submission that there aren't different dilation protocols if you're intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're the same?                 Do you think the, on the same issue I think, that the addition of the deliberately and intentionally language in the congressional act addresses that concern?                 Could I ask you just one thing?                 The statute, of course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries. How common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?                 And in giving your arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery situation.                 Well, my understanding is that the vertex, the skull and head are already outside the mother.                 And the objection in the feet first is that you want fewer instrument passes and so on.                 But in that case, it's not the skull itself that is preventing the delivery of the fetus.                 So your arguments about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as well?    In other words, if you want as much of the fetus intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway? Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the fetus?                 In the case of a vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?                 Can I just follow up on that?                 I don't understand that.     In other words, the fact that it's not the safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden? In other words, under Justice Kennedy's hypothetical --                 He said that the State can prohibit something even if it is the safest procedure, and your answer was so long as it doesn't --                 -- pose an undue burden.   And I was just following up to say that so, in some circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue burden.                Thank you, Miss Smith.
05-381 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Shanmugam. Mr. Haglund. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. HAGLUND ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                   What about the fact that the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational actors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to realize that they are in a better shape having two buyers rather than just one.              So maybe they forego the extra 50 cents a log, or whatever -- tree, it is in the short term and sell enough to keep the other company in business?     I mean they can make that decision themselves.     Or they can make the decision as rational actors that they are better off having more money that they can then use to buy more alder saplings that they can plant for the future.            And either way it benefits the consumers.                    Well if he is, if he is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be selling some to the other, the other processor even if that processor is not bidding as much?                  So then, would you be entitled to a remand on that or not, given that you withdrew that instruction?
05-409 +++$+++                Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Perry. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS            And -- and I understand your submission -- and perhaps it's distinct from the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect -- to suggest that those are different standards, the standard for removal and the standard for preclusion.            So that under your view at least, it's possible that you could have removal jurisdiction and then determine that the -- the case is not, in fact, preempted.            And so that an entirely State law case would proceed in Federal court.           Is there another instance in which we've upheld Federal court jurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action, apart from the Federal officer situation?           But those are the only two.           So this would be a pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to sanction.              But the reason is there are two separate questions.                   They just happen to be identical.            But I mean, the State court isn't going to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not. It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may well have to answer the question whether it's preempted.          It happens to be the same analysis, at least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't meant that you -- that just because a review of the removal decision -- the remand decision is -- is precluded, that review of the preemption decision is precluded.           Counsel --           Counsel, if you -- on the removal question, if there's a dispute about whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage?           Okay.    But you say that when it gets to whether it's a -- there's a -- involving a covered security, for some reason that can't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage.           I'm sorry.     No or yes?      That that is not litigated at the jurisdictional stage?           Why is that?    There -- it's the same clause.            What you can remove is a covered class action involving a covered security.                     So why do we have such different approaches to the different prongs?             Right.   And --                But -- but I still don't -- and this gets back to the question I asked before.        I mean, subsection (c) of 77p -- it's unfortunate we've got a lot of subsection (c)'s here but -- of -- of SLUSA incorporates subsection (b).                Well, it says what can be removed is the covered class action involving a covered security, as set forth in subsection (b).            Why would it have done that?          That would have been a waste of time.            I mean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b). You're saying if they had repeated subsection (b) there, we'd have -- the case would come out the other way?
05-416 +++$+++              Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Feder. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT            Yes it is.   Because the whole -- one of the reasons you have reasonably short time is that you get the witnesses there, they remember it. If you have to file within 15 days with the prison, the prisoner does that, the guard is there, "Do you remember what happened?" "Yes.    This, this, and this." "Who else was there?" "These people were there." You wait 3 months, the prisoner files a complaint, they ask the guard, "Do you remember?" "Not really.     It was 3 months ago." "Who else was there?" "I'm not sure." Then he has -- you know, the evidence against him is much weaker when he files his claim in Federal Court.           No, the point is that if he complies with the time limit, it's going to hurt his claim; therefore, he doesn't want to comply with the time limit.           Well, you were suggesting that the prisoner had no incentive not to comply and go through the State grievance procedure.                    And it seems to me that the reason you have the short procedures are to maintain a fresh record that more accurately reflects the truth, and, since Congress was acting against the backdrop in which they thought there were too many frivolous cases, they thought that might be one way to limit those.
05-465 +++$+++               Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Foster. ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD W. FOSTER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS           There may be no dispute about it, but it does seem kind of strange to encompass them under the term individuals when the same statute uses individuals and corporations separately.           Well, it's not defined in the statute, but the prior list in the same sentence says individual, partnership, corporation.                       So you'd assume whatever an individual is it's different than a corporation or they wouldn't have had to say corporation again.            What is there different about your proceeding to treat this as a RICO enterprise that isn't covered by normal corporate criminal conspiracy law?             What does RICO add here?            So they hire more than one person.            How is that different than a normal contractual relationship that a corporation is going to have with any number of suppliers, vendors, agents?            No, but I'm trying to see what RICO adds to the normal conspiracy law --            -- that would otherwise be applicable.            So we're assuming that the arrangement is there and that they're engaging in illegal activity.            But Congress didn't -- to be fair, Congress did not enact RICO because it was concerned that criminal conspiracy law, applied to corporations, didn't adequately touch interstate commerce.         The whole point is that they had something significantly different in mind, and your allegations in the complaint seem to be fully met by application of criminal conspiracy law.               I'm trying to give you a chance to explain why this looks like RICO rather than just criminal conspiracy.                   And you've come up you said interstate commerce.                  There's got to be more than one.         Well, none of that really suggests a distinction.             What -- what is it that makes this a RICO case rather than just a criminal conspiracy case?               There's a pattern because they hired more than one.                Thank you, counsel. And Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
05-493 +++$+++                     Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Multhaup. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC S. MULTHAUP ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                Why does that --                Why does that matter? Because the jury was told that the factors were merely examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.                It probably didn't fit into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter.                   Before you move on, Counsel --                   -- don't you --                   -- don't you have to address the Teague question a little bit?                 You -- you're entitled to this new rule adopted by the Court of Appeals only if it was dictated by precedent at the time the judgment became final.       Isn't that kind of a hard argument to make in light of our subsequent decision in Brown v. Payton?                Of Boyde?   It's straightforward application of Boyde?                    Well, Penry was considerably tightened by the subsequent decision in Graham versus Collins, though.                    No, I know Payton was an AEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be considered.    And I would have thought, if it was not unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary reading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated by existing precedent.                   Because if it was --                   -- because, even if incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable.                And I'm just having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position is dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180 degrees the opposite of that could be regarded by this Court as reasonable.                  Well, I --                  Graham didn't win his case.                 Well, there is no evidence on that question presented, right?              The reason that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be considered is because neither party had put evidence on that question before the jury.                 No, no.   It's a question of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury.              The jurors couldn't consider that, because it was the -- quite proper for the trial judge to say, "You can't consider that, because there was no evidence on it."

I -- I read somewhere in the facts that only gradually, as each participant in the melee became aware of his presence, did they sort of stop.                It wasn't that as soon as he entered, everything quieted down immediately.                What is the actual evidence that was suppressed?                   And to what extent is that evidence that wasn't available just from looking in through the door?          Couldn't they have gotten all -- wouldn't he have been able to testify to all of that without even entering the home?                   Well, not by you.

WHISMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            Counsel, your -- your position is not that anything that she says or anything anyone says in a 911 call is -- is consistent with the Confrontation Clause.            So what is your -- what is your test?          We have your friend saying any accusatory statement made to a law enforcement officer. What -- what is your proposal?           Mr. Fisher tells us that's exactly what happens, that the 911 operator goes through the elements of the crime in a very structured way.               And she's -- she's in ongoing -- the operator is in ongoing contact with the people she's -- the operator has dispatched.                    Right?                Thank you, counsel.                Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT               Well, maybe.   I mean, it's easy to imagine a 911 call that doesn't fit your description.             You know, the person is trying to get in the door.         The call is -- you know, this is the fourth time.       I keep calling and I've talked to you about this.       You don't do anything.             He's got to be locked up so this will stop.             I mean, that's not -- that sounds more like testimony than an immediate call for help.           Mr. Dreeben, you say focus on the emergency nature.               Very little of what took place in the 911 call is emergency.                He's beating me.      He's jumping on me.        Yes.     What's his name?   I mean, it's not like they'll send help if his name is Joe but they won't if it's Mike.                It doesn't matter. Which direction is he running?               That's not related to the emergency nature of the -- of the call.

05-593 +++$+++                  Thank you, Mr. Grant.    Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                So what if the Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute? What happens then?                No, no, on the procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's just wrong.    It's a criminal case.              The statute says he can do it in a civil case.        On the other hand the statute also says that his certification is conclusive.                Yes, this one is a civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just trying to understand how broad your argument that this is not subject to further review goes.                 Well I thought your analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back and read the statute.     Willingham is a very different statutory predicate.     It's acting under color of law. This is much more specific.          At the time of the incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not sure the analogy holds up.                 But yet that would be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney General can certify that the employee did not do anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's phrased in the affirmative.          He has to certify that he was acting within the scope of his employment.                    But what happens in a case where the certification is clearly wrong?                   I mean, you get into a fight with your neighbor.                It's got nothing to do with your employment at all but the Attorney General certifies that it does.                You know: "They are always thinking about your cases.                You must have been thinking about it at the time."                That certification goes into the district court.                The district court looks at it and says this is ridiculous, throws it out, then that State law assault case proceeds in Federal court?                  Well, they wouldn't have discretion in that case, though, because the statute says the Attorney General's certification is conclusive for purposes of removal.                  I thought maybe your answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.                  It would still be conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction.                Well, the jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that.                Justice Ginsburg's point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I take it is because these are not separate State claims appended to what you thought was a Federal claim.                   This is the same claim that you initially thought was a Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for purposes of jurisdiction.

GORNSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER                    Since you barely cite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the Teague question before the AEDPA question.                    It is law that is applied in Federal court, though.                 I assume you have an interest in that.                   Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Ms. Forsman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES A.

It was overruled because of a judgment that the Founders wanted there to be cross-examination.                      You had the opportunity to challenge those findings under the Roberts regime in state court?                  That's not -- the state has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on the merits in state court and results in a decision that was contrary to clearly established Federal law.                  So it seems to me that the question is what was the law, what was the clearly established law at the time of the state decision.

HOWE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT              But it's clear, Counsel, though, that the first prong of M'Naghten adds something different, "You don't understand the nature and quality of your acts."                In other words, it would be enough, if you recognized both prongs, if he thought this was a Martian, regardless of whether he knew it was wrong to kill a Martian or not.              Why is that, Counsel? Let's suppose that the -- one of the cases that come up is a language difficulty.                  The individual -- maybe he's not in uniform -- identifies himself as a police officer.         Could the State have a rule that, "We are not going to allow evidence of language concerns," that the individual didn't speak English, and the officer said, "I'm a police officer," so he didn't know, when he shot him?      What is it about mental capacity that allows you to exclude that type of evidence?              You can -- may answer.              Thank you, Mr. Howe. General Clement, we'll hear now from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT            Counsel --           -- the -- the argument you're making is really one of invited error, and I'm not sure it even applies on these facts.                   I mean, the -- the defense lawyer didn't, as you hypothesized in one of your answers, say something to the effect of don't worry, you don't need to make any findings of the ends of justice or anything like that. He just said I'm waiving my speedy trial rights, and that may mean he's not gong to argue, you know, that the ends of justice don't justify it or whatever.                      He's just saying I don't have any objection.                Maybe he assumed that the judge would go on and say, okay, I'm making the findings required by subsection 8(a).            Why do you -- why do you put that in a separate category?                    It's kind of unusual for Congress to put that type of a requirement in the statute.          They could have normally -- I suspect they normally would write it.               You know, you -- you -- they're excludable only if the court finds in the interest of justice.          But they went further and they said if the court sets forth orally or in writing in the record of the case.            I mean, they set it forth as a separate requirement.           I don't know that we can give it sort of a second-class status.            Or say the error is not complying with the act.           Oh, no, that -- pardon?            Even if we agree with you on the incompetency exclusion, we still have to reach the waiver for all time question.                 Correct?    You don't argue that the incompetency goes back that far, do you?           You're not suggesting he was incompetent during that period as well.           Yes.               If it was a question, yes.

Can you -- can you --                -- can you collect -- can a patentee collect license fees based on an -- patent that has been determined to be invalid?                 It would --                 It would be pursuant to the agreement.                 Collective --                 Even if --                 -- the royalty agreement says, you know, "We have a dispute about the validity of this patent.    We don't know.           We disagree.     And so, we've entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the uncertainty."    But once it's determined to be invalid, the license fees are not collectible.                 I thought your argument -- I'm sorry.                   What about the fact that it's under protest?                 Well, their concrete right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license fees.                 Well, that's what --                 -- a declaratory judgment action does, though, isn't it?                 Ms. Mahoney, you argue, in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment Act.   We can't reach that argument unless we rule against you on the Article III question.               Is that right?                 We would have to be assuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we?                 Under Article III?

I would have thought your answer would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, been given a very expansive reading.               And you don't need to say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have thought was a job for a court, which is to determine whether there's a private right of action to bring its action within a boilerplate term like unjust or unreasonable. I would have thought the contact point was what I was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is whether or not this is such communication service under 201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something that the agency gets deference on.                But it would seem to me, that's where the limitation would come.              Well, I think that's right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the consequences of its determination that something is unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with respect to a private right of action.               I saw that argument.      I have to say I don't understand it.                   Why is it so difficult?    I get a bill every month that easily sorts out which are interstate and which are intrastate.                Thank you, Mr. Englert. Mr. Feldman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT               Do you have a position on whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the Commission's determination of whether or not their action creates or gives rise to a right of action?               There are two different, it seems to me, two different Chevron questions.            The one is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust and unreasonable.    The other is the question of whether or not they have anything to say about whether that means there is a private right of action in court.               But it's never gotten deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether or not there is or is not a right -- whether there is a right of action to enforce its regulations.               So you would have a different position here if 276 said something like, we think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have this scheme.   In other words, it has nothing to do with whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy.               Then you'd say that could be something that's not covered by the "just and reasonable" provision?

OLIVIERI ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                  One reason to require total exhaustion is because, I would assume the prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward with litigation.    But I guess that's only true if the exhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when we're talking about unexhausted claims, are those typically claims that are not going to be available or are they claims that may generate relief once there is exhaustion?                    Counsel, you've mentioned in your brief that there has been a change in the Michigan grievance policy with respect to naming individuals.   What is the consequence of that change for our ability to address that claim?                    I thought one of the objections to the Sixth Circuit rule from your friend was that this requirement of naming the individuals came out of thin air.   And now we have that requirement articulated in the grievance policy.                    Does that make a difference?                   Did the Sixth Circuit have the current Michigan policy before them when they made their decision?                    Thank you, Counsel.
05-746 +++$+++              Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Ms. Perry? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. PERRY ON BEHALF OF THE Respondent             Well, doesn't there have to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a comparative negligence regime?         Because, you know, you talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing it to a certain degree.     And if you're not dealing with apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the comparison.                Right.   But we're talking about comparative negligence here, where there's negligence on both sides.        And I just don't know how you say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using different causation standards.              You don't have any conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, because it's comparative negligence.                It seems to me that necessarily implies in whole or in part.                If you can reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in instruction 13?              No, no.    I thought Justice Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's instruction might cause confusion because of it.               But I don't see how adding it to both of them when you're dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily the case that partial negligence on either of their parts can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be confusing.                   You can answer it.                   Under that scenario, then, what objection could there be to a recognition that the negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the accident?                But that's what Justice Souter has identified, right?             That's not because they're adopting different standards.                Well, you just told me, a good reason for not putting in whole or in part in instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the whole part doesn't make sense with contributory negligence.   That's a good reason not to put it in Section 53 either.              You don't have to say that.   I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to follow the words of the statute.             And so whole or in part makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't appear in Section 53.   Why don't we just -- why shouldn't the instruction just say, "such negligence of the plaintiff contributed to cause his injury."          It's not going to be a complete bar because we know the immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing the award by the amount of the negligence.          Why wouldn't that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?             Well, no, but he requested that the instructions be the same, and the directly is what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in the statute.                Do you think they raised an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?             That's what Rogers might have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about slight cause.    It only says in whole or in part.             Why isn't "in whole or in part" simply the logical corollary of introducing comparative negligence?        Why do you have to read that as departing from proximate cause, instead of simply recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?               That's why you don't have "in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to depart from proximate cause there, but because, as Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in whole or in part.             Thank you, Ms. Perry.
05-785 +++$+++                Mr. Fermino? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. FERMINO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT               I don't understand your point about the state court focusing on Norris.                    The question under AEDPA is still whether or not it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.               To wear any buttons?      It says, "Fair Trial."               I mean, most -- I don't think -- a typical jury will understand that the victim is going to have a family, and they're going to be sorry that he's dead, and they might be there at his trial. And they may not like the person accused of murdering their son.   That is not -- that is sort of like in every case.   That's not -- the buttons don't seem to add much to what the jury will derive from seeing the family seated behind the prosecution bench.                  So what about -- what if the issue was mourning?          The trial is being held and the families appear and they're all in black because they're still in mourning.      Does that violate this clearly established rule?              No, my question is under AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going to keep the family out even in mourning, that would violate the clearly established rule that you've just articulated?               You don't want to put your -- hang your hat on the "contrary to" prong, though, do you?   Your argument, I thought, was an unreasonable application argument.                  Well, but, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we've never even had a case involving spectators.        So it's not contrary to clearly established law.     We have cases stating the general principle on which it relies, so maybe it's an unreasonable application.            But "contrary to" seems an awful stretch.                  Thank you, Mr. Fermino.
05-83 +++$+++                 Thank you, Ms. Millett. Mr. Link. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY C. LINK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              Counsel, you asked for an instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm.         Under that provision of Washington law, does the firearm have to be operable as well?              So you ask for an instruction assuming that the firearm at issue in this case was operable.              But if the firearm were not operable, you would not have been entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser offense of aiming a firearm.         Correct?              Counsel, what your trial counsel said was that the -- I'm quoting from the joint appendix, page 30 -- the allegation and the basis on which this case was tried was under the theory of firearm.         It seems inconsistent with your representation that nobody had an idea that they were trying this under the theory of a firearm.              Ms. Millett tells us that that only applies on remand under -- under the Hughes case.              Well, doesn't -- isn't that true in Neder as well?              Well, but the special verdict form still was.              And do you know if the information went to the jury in this case?              Well, the other way of looking at it is it's based on trying to understand what the jury meant when it said deadly weapon when the only evidence of a deadly weapon they were presented was a firearm.                And in Neder, even if the jury had been asked to rule on materiality, it could have decided not to rule according to the evidence.         The same argument applies in Neder.

PHILLIPS, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                 Just a pause, under your view or the Fourth Circuit's view?                 If you read Judge Tatel's opinion in New York versus EPA, he suggests -- suggests, he says that EPA adopted different interpretations of modification from the outset.                    And so if what you are saying couldn't have been challenged, was the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate. But if you are saying what couldn't have been anticipated was the argument you actually made to the Fourth Circuit, that might be a different story.                Your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle.               It is not just that they used the word modification in one place and the word modification in the other.               It's that in the latter place, they said modification as defined in the first place.                 Could you explain to me again why this isn't a 307(b) problem?                 You said this is an action by the administrator?                 You can't challenge in the D.C. Circuit the administrator's interpretation that led to the enforcement action?
05-85 +++$+++                    Counsel, it's a good thing you've got a lot of fallback arguments because you fall back very quickly.        I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito would be, the statute says if it's remanded, it's not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.     And if it's remanded for a silly reason, that will be corrected on review of the State supreme court by this Court.                    That certainly changes the argument.      So the notice of appeal that's filed or the brief on appeal says not only was the court wrong, it was patently wrong, and the court of appeals has to consider that before determining whether it has jurisdiction to review the remand order.

SNURKOWSKI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS            Counsel, I would have thought your -- your answer to the line of questioning earlier was that the reason that the Petitioner has to come up with this -- an alternative is that otherwise it's plausible, at least, to suspect the reason he's bringing the action is as a challenge to the execution itself rather than the particular method.                 And that if it's a challenge to the execution itself, it has to be brought under habeas.           If it's just a challenge to the method, it can be brought under 1983.                  If he's unwilling to say there is a valid method, then it starts to look like a challenge to the execution that has to be brought under habeas.            Thank you, counsel.

Right?              Mr. Shanmugam, several of the emergency death proceedings we've had involving this question, the district court judges have assumed that it could proceed under 1983 but then denied relief because it was brought on the eve of execution, as this one was.

What if you adopted a plan that insisted on a more or less rigid 60-40 ratio at every school and assignments were made on that basis.                      It was not a follow-on to a choice system.                   Would that be unconstitutional?                   The same -- the facts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that private choice contributes to further division rather than integration and so the assignments are made on a 60-40 basis.                   I still don't have your answer. Is strict assignment 60-40 without regard to choice constitutional or not?                   And how does this not present narrow tailoring problems if -- if the -- when you get to the fact of choice, the sole criteria at that level is the same as would be the case in a 60-40 assignment.                    One of the, one of the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the plan has a logical end point.            What is the logical end point in this plan?                  Nothing under the plan requires that, does it?                   You don't defend the choice policy on the basis that the schools offer education to everyone of the same quality, do you?                   How is that different from the separate but equal argument?                 In other words, it doesn't matter that they're being assigned on the basis of their race because they're getting the same type of education.                   Even though in the individual cases the students, including minority students, and I gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being denied admission on the basis of their race?                   They are being denied admission to the school of their choice?                   But the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin.                 So saying that this doesn't involve individualized determinations simply highlights the fact that the decision to distribute, as you put it, was based on skin color and not any other factor.                   Well, you're saying every -- I mean, everyone got a seat in Brown as well; but because they were assigned to those seats on the basis of race, it violated equal protection.                 How is your argument that there's no problem here because everybody gets a seat distinguishable?                     There's no effort here on the part of the school to separate students on the basis of race.      It's an assignment on the basis of race, correct?

MARCUS, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 Why do you look at the risk of burglary and then view attempt as a sort of lesser included offense?       I mean, attempts themselves have their own independent risk of physical injury. Obviously, if you've got a ladder up against the side of my house and you're halfway up and I come home, there's a risk of injury there, even though there's no -- regardless of whether the person gets into the house or not. And I think perhaps there's even a greater risk of potential -- greater potential risk of injury with respect to attempts because they don't succeed. Why don't they succeed?       Because something interrupts them.    And what interrupts them, it may well be the home owner.   So I don't know that you have to look to sort of attempt as a lesser risk than the burglary itself.                    I would suppose the unsuccessful burglar poses a greater risk of physical injury than the successful burglar.                  Thank you, Mr. Marcus.

BERGERON, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                   Does a parent have a right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights under this statute are interfered with by the state actors?                   I think I understand your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' fees and it's phrased in a very curious way.                      It says that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.                      It seems to me that's the most difficult express language for you to deal with.    It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a parent.   And I understand your argument to be that a parent can never be a prevailing party.                    Are attorneys' fees allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases on behalf of a child pro se?                     It's a convoluted question.   Okay.    So there's no issue under the spending clause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim some sort of attorneys' fees?                     So how is the spending clause issue very significant in terms of the exposure of the school boards?                     Well, that's where I have a little bit of trouble.              It's not -- the underlying right is still the same.                      It's the right of the child to a free and appropriate public education. And that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're talking about is a situation where the parents can assert that same right when an attorney won't. And I'm just wondering how significant additional exposure we're talking about?                      And what turns on that is whether to take the spending clause argument seriously or not.                   Right.   But you would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to take the case.   What, what your spending clause argument is, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that they would have to provide a free and appropriate education, that if they litigated, they would have pay the other side's attorneys' fees.                But if they knew that in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the parents could prosecute it, and that might result in overturning their decision and that might result in greater expense, well, in that case they would not have bought into this deal at all.              That seems a little implausible.                     I'm not disputing that it results in additional exposure.                  I'm just disputing that it affects the voluntariness of their agreement to undertake the program.
05-996 +++$+++                   Mr. Brunstad. ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Under -- you think 105 is an affirmative grant of power?                   105(a) is much more limited than that.    It is only if you take the second clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been done, that it looks like an affirmative grant.                It says: "No provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action." That's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement that a particular party raise an issue.                I -- as a source of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a roving commission in equity, I think that's a mis-citation.                   What do you do about the different structures, wording between 706(a) and 706(b)?   I mean, this provision says debtor may.                The other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to order, and it suggests a difference in who has the primary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the Court or whether it is an independent action.                 So you think under those other provisions the court doesn't have this inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that you're arguing for here?                 If you, if given that the court has express statutory authority to reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap of conferring inherent equitable authority to do something, when the statute addresses it in a much more specific way?                 Well, maybe, maybe not.     I mean, they convert.         He comes up with a plan under 13 that looks better to creditors.                 I mean, just because there's fraud that offends the court and prompts it to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that that's going to be the same situation after conversion.                  Even if it might injure the creditors.                What limitations would you recognize on this inherent authority to take action?   Where do they come from?                 The sense it makes is that that's what the statute provides, and rather than relying on this alleged inherent power that apparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of which will have to be articulated in case after case after case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism to address the issue of fraud which allows him to reconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly.                  Well, I still haven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice is.   Who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in the statute?   The conversion takes place.                The judge then says, because of this fraud, I'm going to reconvert it to Chapter 7.     Who suffers under that?              You say sit idly by, but I don't see the long passage of time.                   Thank you, counsel.   Ms. Blatt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS                Well, what are the odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent authority to deny relief?       He's not going to let it languish under Chapter 13.                Well, why wouldn't that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he reconvert it to Chapter 7?                   I wouldn't call it a right to convert in bad faith.              If it's a right, it's a right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith. It's not a right to convert in bad faith.                 No one is arguing for that.                  What about the idea that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look, whether the facts bear this out in this case or not, I've got a job now.     I can pay off my debtors -- my creditors according to this plan, and, as the statute requires, the creditors get more under 13 than under under 7.    That's a benefit to everybody.                   And he says, I'm sorry about that bad faith business.                   If the statute didn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be reconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the inherent equitable authority to do that?                   Sure.                 Well, what about the difference in language under 706(a) and the other provisions?     706(a) says the debtor may.              The other provisions call for action by the court, which suggests at least that the authority to convert is greater under 706(a).                 I guess I've been assuming -- but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even under the present case is a present day question, right? In other words, we don't go back and see if he was eligible for Chapter 13 when the conversion was denied? The question would be whether he's eligible now?

BAGGOT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                You don't have any -- you're not suggesting to us that the grand jury that indicted him for intentionally attempting to enter the United States at or near San Luis would not have indicted him if the indictment had gone further and said, and he submitted false IDs?                But that's not an element.   You talk about essential facts and material -- I mean, the statute makes it a crime to intentionally attempt to enter the United States having previously been deported and all that.           It doesn't say anything about presenting false identification.             So why are those essential facts when they're not part of what the statute prohibits?                    Thank you, Mr. Baggot.
06-1005 +++$+++                   Mr. Vare. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. VARE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                  Didn't Justice Alito correctly suggest that these merger problems would still persist even under your definition of "proceeds"?                     No, but I mean if you have a "profits" definition and the enterprise has profits, all of these problems we've been talking about in terms of the merger, as I call it, between the money laundering and the underlying offense would still be there, right?                   I didn't see that you presented -- a separate question presented in your opposition.                   Where is that?                   Not at page (ii).                   Oh, but I am looking at the orange one, not the red one.                       The orange one is what we have before us when we decide whether or not to grant certiorari.     And there you don't have a different question presented.                      If we adopt your position, we will have to decide a question like, for example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary business expense in carrying out illegal gambling operations, right?                   Let's take two illegal gambling operations that are identical in every way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200 a week.     The other pays the runners $500 a week.                       And the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because he's paying too much to the runners. The first one, the more successful operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money laundering because its has profits.                       The other one doesn't.     So incompetence is rewarded.                   But the --                     No, I'm focusing on the question presented -- that was the only question presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the question of whether "proceeds" is considered gross revenues or profits.                   So someone who simply paid off whoever it is that ships in, you know, a ton of heroin, you'd say is not guilty then?                Same thing.   I mean, you're just paying off the people who engage in the activities that are necessary for the continuation and promotion of the illegal enterprise.                      Well, how do they know even what the fiscal year of these enterprises is? I mean let's suppose you have some costs.                   They have to buy the poppy field or wherever, but, you know, over 3 years, they're going to make a lot of money.                   You're saying you can't prosecute them in year 2?                      My point is the profits may not come in immediately, even though the underlying activity is exactly the same.                   Well that's -- but we don't try to solve every case.                We look at particular questions presented.      And maybe there's going to be another case coming up in which the issue of how broadly you should construe promotion is, or whether you should have a different definition when the offenses are merged or not.    And we'll confront that when it gets here. It seems to me that your argument is -- maybe your best argument, but your argument, anyway, is let's avoid this question because of these other mistakes that have been made, mistakes which are not presented to us on the question on which we granted cert.                      I thought it would depend on whether or not the insurance proceeds exceeded how much he had to pay the hit man, right?                   Let's say he's not doing it to get the insurance money.                   It just so happens he had a $50,000 policy on the victim --                  Yes.   He just wanted to commit the murder, not get the money.                 And so he pays the hit man $100,000, he gets the $50,000, and then uses it for all these other activities, you'd say no money laundering, because no profits?                  I thought their answer was the money laundering statute covers a whole waterfront of activities besides illegal gambling.                    And the question is, what did Congress intend when they passed the money laundering statute. This is kind of the tail wagging the dog. The tail is, well, it presents these problems when you're talking about gambling operations, but there's a whole rest of the dog area where it doesn't present a problem.
06-10119 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Bright. Mr. Boudreaux. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY M. BOUDREAUX ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Mr. Bright contrasts that with the more probing inquiry with respect to white jurors who said "I think I could," and here there was no follow-up.                   Mr. Boudreaux, even if -- even if you're correct that a neutral explanation was given focusing on the emotional distress, are you -- do you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy if there had been a black juror on the jury?                    I still have -- I am curious to the answer to Justice Breyer's question. When they go back and back strike at that point can the defendant say I don't think you can back strike this juror you're doing it on the basis of race.                      They can go back and back strike.                      They can go back and object to the back striking?              The State would say, well here's the reasons we're back striking.                   I'm sorry. There's some ambiguity in your answer. Miller-El says others who were struck can be considered as part of the totality.         My question is -- can they go back and object not only to the back struck juror, but as Justice Stevens points out, to the others who weren't objected to perhaps because there wasn't a black person on the jury?                   Still, the prosecutor is still there.          You can ask the prosecutor, why did you strike that juror?

06-1037 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  So it's fine for them to use that, but you're saying it's not fine for them to use any element of age in making that computation?                  Even though, under the Federal law, they can use age as the exclusive requirement in determining retirement?                   You prevent the State from taking into account the fact that younger disabled workers have not had the same opportunity that older disabled workers have.           And it results -- if we adopt your system where you can look only at years of service, what it, in effect, is going to do is to prevent Kentucky from giving disability benefits to older workers who become disabled. For example, if you have two workers, one who starts work at 18 and acquires years of service, say, 12 years of service and becomes disabled, you would say, well, you can take those years of service into account.   The older worker who begins at age 30 and is disabled in his first year on the job, you say, well, you can only look at years of service.                    You can't impute to both of them retirement age.              So the 30-year-old who becomes disabled has to get less, fewer benefits than the 18-year-old who becomes disabled.
06-1082 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Well, I thought it's questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief.                 You seem to suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in this case.                  So - so we should write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was correct to -- we're not saying that it was correct to exclude the evidence in this case?                   No, it says the laws of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as well.                  Do we have to look at both of those varieties?            Let's say the State has a rule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we would say you can't, but you don't have to have probable cause.   You just have to -- they're just arrestable.                  -- is probable cause to arrest.   The State has a law that says you can arrest in these circumstances whether or not you have probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed.                  I thought you were telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been committed.                   So it is, as your friends on the other side put it, you are advocating a two-step process.     There has to be probable cause to arrest and there has to be probable cause to believe a crime has been committed?                   No, they're different here.    They had probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, but you say they didn't have probable cause to arrest because State law makes it illegal.                   What if the State makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater? You're suggesting in that situation the common law rule we have doesn't apply.         It's a trivial offense, but it's made arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.                  Well, what if the legislature -- this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben posed.   What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest for this offense but you cannot search incident to the arrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion given the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense? In that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth Amendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be reversed preempted, preempted by the State law?                  So the State can define the circumstances under which you can have an arrest, but the State can't define and limit the consequences of the arrest?                    Counsel, can I get back to your discussion of Cooper?                  In Cooper, you said that if it violates the State law for an inventory search, then you can't search incident to that.                  But that's because it is then not an inventory search.                     Here there's no doubt that this was an arrest, whether it complied with State law or not.                   No, but just -- it gets to -- I mean, if you don't follow the State rules, it doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory search.     But here you're saying if don't -- you're not saying if you don't follow the State rules, it's not an arrest.     It's not a lawful arrest.                But that's a different question than whether or not it is an arrest. Our precedents say if it's an arrest, you can search incident to the arrest.                   Counsel, if we assume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the exclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you explain why, under the Federal Constitution, there should be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for a violation of State law when State law does not impose an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?                   Well, I guess the question would be:      Why doesn't our jurisprudence on whether there's an arrest also look to something else, rather than whether it's permitted or violated under State law?    In other words, the State doesn't -- the State law does not provide for the exclusionary rule, but we say the Fourth Amendment does. Under -- this is not a valid arrest under State law, but your brothers say under the Fourth Amendment it is because there's probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.                    I think your friend agreed that the cases didn't establish whether our references to probable cause meant to probable cause to arrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed.     You don't agree with that?                Do you think that the cases foreclose their position?                  You can finish your answer.

What is your understanding of the Illinois statute?                    It is, I take it, only triggered by failure to report for confinement?                   What about like, you know, you've got to see your probation officer every --                    And you concede the probation or parole situation?                    So we need not so many -- not so much statistics about how many times violence results, but statistics about how serious the police are about picking somebody up?                  I understood your friend -- excuse me.      I understood your friend to say that you don't have a single example of failure to report leading to a violent confrontation.

What do you do with your friend's argument that the classification -- or the term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't always have to do with how serious they view the offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one year to allow time for rehabilitation?

I guess this is a question I asked your friend.                 I mean, degree of risk.   I mean what are the odds that we're going to -- that if there's a burglary, some physical injury might result as opposed to an episode of drunk driving.                    In other words, I guess -- do we really look at how -- what percentage of drunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to what percentage of burglars are involved in violent confrontations?                   How much of a limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making?                  I mean, let's say you've got a habitual drunk driver. Everybody in town says he always drives drunk.                  I mean, how would they greet the news:               Guess what?     He's just got a gun.   I mean, that raises the level of risk significantly, doesn't it?

Parties that are out of time in this Court going to a lower court and saying well, just vacate and re-enter, and then I can start all over again?     We've discouraged that.                     But don't you know that your interpretation reads the word tax out of this statute?   I mean your position would be exactly the same if it just said 10 percent of the value of the property in Guam.                     With respect to much of the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the legislature as well.                    And what was the appraisal practice?     I mean, in a lot of these jurisdictions you have appraised value that turns out to be 30 percent of the actual market value.                   But doesn't it -- who is this provision designed to protect, just the Guamanian taxpayers or Federal taxpayers more generally?                   If the Guamanian government runs a deficit, where is the difference made up from?                   I know that any taxes from Guam are returned to Guam.                     Are additional tax revenues given to Guam other than those that are derived from Guam?                   So that if the Guamanian Treasury runs into difficulty, it's made up not just by Guamanian taxpayers, but by all Federal taxpayers?                   Yeah, but you talked about this as the deference we owe to the Guam Supreme Court.    This is a Federal statute, right?                This was passed by Congress.                  Does that apply to all the provisions of the Organic Act?                   I mean, there are provisions there addressing the jurisdictional issue that we are considering here as well.                   Do we defer to the Guam Supreme Court's view on that?                  That's fine.
06-11612 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Newton. Ms. Blatt? ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Of course, it might be said of the right to plead guilty as well.                    The lawyer has a lot more experience with what kind of sentence the judge is going to impose, what the odds are of the jury returning a verdict of innocence.                    I mean, the fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the judgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.                   Do you -- do you think the right to a jury trial is something that has to be personally waived by the defendant or can that be waived through counsel?                   Were those -- was the right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?                   When I was researching it, I saw that it was usually included in the list, but I thought it would track back to some case that held that it was, but it never -- never does.                      Well, suppose the question would come up.          I mean, if the circuit does that the question would come up, if the magistrate doesn't do it and it's not objected to, because of course if it's objected to you deal with it then.                      And then we'd have to decide, or the Court would have to decide whether that's a basis for reversal.

You know, I don't -- it's -- we've found it difficult enough to figure out which statutes are jurisdictional and which are not. And now you want us to say, well, even if it's jurisdictional, the consequences may be different for jurisdiction and for equitable tolling and for waivibility.   I mean, it seems to me that's a very difficult argument.                  I suppose Franconia would be a case where the Irwin logic not only would but did apply.

CLEMENT, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                   The DTA, see, is unclear to me, anyway, on this question.                 You agree that there is the authority under the DTA, and I assume under the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in reviewing those determinations, to order a release?                  2243 doesn't specify the availability of release, either, but it has certainly been interpreted to authorize that by habeas courts in this country.                  Yes, but that --                    I suppose any challenges to the adequacy of the standards, or whatever, are the sort of things that would be raised in the D.C. Circuit.    And we don't know what that's going to look like yet, because the D.C. Circuit hasn't had an opportunity to rule on those.                    The procedures that are before us under the DTA and the MCA, of course, weren't available for the whole six-year period, were they?                    Is that because the withdrawal of jurisdiction does not apply to review of the proceedings in the D.C. Circuit that's provided under the statute?      In other words, your argument that the habeas jurisdiction doesn't extend doesn't reach the review of the adequacy of the DTA proceedings?

SWIFT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   So there might be a different situation in your hypothetical with respect to bankruptcy.     In effect, there's an administrator against whom the Philippines could proceed, unlike the situation here, where you have a class and which the prospect of the Philippines proceeding later is not realistic.                  Because aren't those issues that could be addressed when the Philippines attempt to enforce a judgment they would get in the Philippines if they do in fact get such a judgment?                     Counsel, before you sit down, you haven't mentioned anything about your argument that the Philippines don't have the right to raise this.     Are you throwing in the towel on that one?                     Well, the Philippines National Bank and Arelma were, and of course they've appealed.       And I understand the law to be they can raise these arguments.              We don't have need to have an independent basis for the Philippines.
06-1221 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Egan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E. EGAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Counsel, what if you have a situation that's been referred to earlier, where you have four other supervisors that are presented as "me, too" evidence.       They are in the Los Angeles office. The defendant's supervisor is in the Fresno office.                   Is that evidence relevant?                   It is just that they -- they are alleged to have fired people for an impermissible basis under the age discrimination act as well.                   All right, let's take it and say yes.                   Well, but doesn't that beg the question?         We don't know.             This isn't a pattern and practice case.            You don't have evidence of a company-wide policy of discrimination.                    Take my hypothetical.     There are just four people who are alleged to harbor age-based bias, and they -- in the Los Angeles office.     No connection to the Fresno supervisor at all, other than that they work for the same company. Is that enough for relevance?                   It might not be relevant.                  404.                   Are these episodes that were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at issue here?                   You don't make the -- you don't suggest that he was even aware of these other anecdotes.                   But you're conceding that we don't even know that that comment was communicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here. He may not have been aware of it.                  The supervisor -- he may have been in Fresno and that supervisor in Los Angeles.                      I assume there's no dispute over any direct evidence you have that the supervisor was being guided by a company policy or statement or the RIF program that was discriminatory. The issue here is whether or not you can bring in testimony that -- which has no demonstrated connection to the supervisor.                    But what --                   What happens in this case?   Let's say there are five "me, too" situations presented, and the court make a determination in each one, and the jury finds for the plaintiff.                   And then it's appealed, and the argument on appeal is, well, in three of those five cases there wasn't age discrimination and here's why.                And that evidence is -- well then the court of appeals agrees, yes, those three cases shouldn't have been admitted. Is that reversible error?                   No, under my hypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals, let's say, determines that the alleged statements did not occur.     That's the argument.              And this was admitted to the jury in three of the five cases, and those statements did not occur.                   Is that reversible error on appeal?                  Five gets you cases when the court of appeals determines that three did not occur?                  What if I assume your rule cuts the other way? Let's say in this company of 70,000 or 17,000, or whatever it is, there are a thousand supervisors.    Four or five are alleged to have discriminated on the basis of age. I assume the company can call the other 995 and say:    Are there any allegations against you?                  Did you fire people?    And did you in some cases keep the oldest one? And then they have to -- you know, they say yes.    So the, "me, too" evidence works both ways, right?                  So if you are talking about culture, what is the culture of the company if 995 supervisors don't supervise -- don't discriminate in their decisions and 5 do?                    So if company can admit evidence to show the opposite of your "me, too" evidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the culture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to admit before -- to show the opposite culture?                     Certainly more than five if they say this isn't representative. You have to look at these 15 others.                    Right.     There are 15, 30, or however many is equally relevant.                    So you think the court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the evidence was admissible?          Because as I understand your answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a 403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the district court to undertake that.                    And if on the remand that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in the context of a motion in limine and not in the context of a new trial?                    So you think a new trial is required for the district court to make the 403 determination?                      Yes.                      Thank you, Mr. Egan.
06-1249 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   What about the various portions of the label in the record that Mr. Waxman addressed and Mr. Kneedler, representing the FDA, said they specifically considered IV push risks?                     Well, they have to. When they determine that it's safe to use it under those circumstances that necessarily includes a consideration of the risk.     People can say it's safe for you to walk down the sidewalk.      That doesn't mean there is no risk that you get hit by lightning or something else.                   It just means in evaluating them together, they determine that it's worth the candle in particular cases where a physician determines that that's the indicated method.                    I thought your -- I thought your theory was that this type of administration of the drug should not be allowed.                 The label should not say here are the risks, here are the benefits.                   You -- your jury theory was you cannot suggest in the labeling that physicians should have this available.                    Well, it simply says that if you go ahead with the label like this, you don't have to pay $10 million whenever it comes wrong.                   That's having the effect, as our case has established, imposing a limitation on the label.                   So your case depends upon us determining that the risk at issue here that was presented to the jury was a new risk that the FDA did not consider?                   Suppose --                   So now, your friends on the other side said there was specific consideration of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and that that is laid forth in the labeling.                  So, as I understood your answer to be, all we have to do is simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we determine that they did not, then they lose.                   Well, I don't know if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it.                  I mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and they either address IV push separately or they don't.
06-1286 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Rubin. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    You didn't think much of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted it, did you?   You didn't argue this before the Court of Appeals? (Laughter.)                    So you have a fallback argument.                    Well, now might be a good time to fall back. (Laughter.)                  So how does your customary or commonly incurred test work?                  Let's say you have two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000.                    I think an individual with $10 million might well seek investment advice, but an individual with only 10,000 might decide it's not worth it.               Would you have a different application of the 2 percent rule for those two trusts?                  How many -- how many individuals do you need?          Let's say it's $3 million in the trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would hire an investment advisor; 40 percent would think they can do just as well on their own.                 Is that customarily incurred by individuals?                   Your answer to both questions is "might well be," and that's a fairly vague line when it comes to taxes.                   Or, even worse, advisors are going to break themselves up into different advisors.    There's going to be somebody who says I'm a fiduciary advisor whenever a trustee calls, but, I'm a normal advisor, when it's an individual.                   What's your best case for that proposition?             Your colleague resisted the notion that he had the burden and what's your best case for that?                   But I thought that rule applied to the applicability of individual exemptions.     Here we have a different question.                It's how to read an exception to the general rule.                   Do you have a case for a proposition that the taxpayer has the burden in those cases?         You said that in your brief, but it didn't have a case cite with it.                      What if you get a bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice, and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice?                   In other words, they figure out what good stocks are they pushing these days and they go down and say, well, you're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that. You would -- would you agree that the $20,000 is not subject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?
06-1287 +++$+++                      Thank you, Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. Mr. Calvert. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN R. CALVERT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Well, that's what -- I'm sorry.                   I thought that would be part of your reply to Justice Breyer, that you had five different methodologies here and you chose the lowest one; and the question really is how many more methodologies do you have to look at if you're going to choose the lowest one in each case.                   You know, if this comes down as it probably will in every case, to a battle of competing experts, are you aware of any other area where we say that a district court cannot look at the methodology used by an expert in determining whether or not to give credence to the expert's opinion?                   So why should we create a special rule here for the State?                      What if what if the State elected to use reproduction cost as its valuation method, which I guess everybody agrees vastly overstates the value of the railroad?                      So if there are problems with a particular methodology, the methodology can be challenged?                  Right.    And your argument is that it's not reasonable because it must overstate the value by a particular percentage or number. And I think Justice Souter's question is: Well, where do you draw the line? If you say it's not reasonable because it overstates value by 50 percent, is a methodology that overstates value by 20 percent reasonable or not --                  -- keeping in mind all the methodologies here range from 8 -- 6 billion to 12 billion.
06-1321 +++$+++                       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Do you agree with your friend that this employee has no remedy under the Civil Service Reform Act?                   Why is that?   I mean, if you have the private -- the private sector remedy is not so limited, right?                   Well, if we imply or incorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedy an anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be in the same scope as the private anti -- the private anti-retaliation provision.                      Isn't this an unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly retaliated against also has substantive anti-discrimination claims?              And I gather -- I think it would take a particularly incompetent lawyer that couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying discrimination.                  Are those, are those mostly witness cases?                  In other words, it's a witness saying I think so and so was fired because of his age.                   That does bring up Justice Alito's point.       I mean, tomorrow you're going to argue the exact opposite, right?                   Or else that distinction between conduct and status would require you to lose.                   Counsel, I would have thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question would be:   This is an unusual situation where you have the employer writing the law about what the employees can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that they as the employer didn't want to face that disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil Service Reform Act already.

So I'm not quite sure how that international practice reflected in or arising out of the convention is terribly pertinent.                  And in some cases they used language directly from the convention and in this case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly ill-advised source for looking for what they were trying to do.

BAROV ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Counsel, why isn't your friend correct that you have waived any argument based on the presence of Lexis in Illinois?                     Well, but that's -- they are very different from your current argument, which you emphasize that whether they are unitary or not, Lexis/Nexis was in Illinois.                     Okay.   Now, as to that argument, at least I am very reluctant to overturn a State court on an argument that they didn't have an opportunity to consider.          And whether it's technically waived because you raised it in the trial court or not, it certainly was not an argument you made to the Illinois appellate courts.                     Well, it wasn't in Allied-Signal.    In Allied-Signal the asset that was sold was in New Jersey, and that was totally irrelevant to how we treated the issue in that case.                  Well, that's why it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the argument based on the Lexis connection to Illinois. That's the basis on which your auditor is claiming these taxes; and, yet, you don't even raise it before the Illinois appellate court as a ground for being able to reach the Lexis/Nexis income.                  We couldn't do anything more if we said you haven't waived it, we couldn't do anything more than send it back.                     You're telling us Lexis has this presence in Illinois, but we have nothing in the record about that.                  Where is that?                  I just -- usually appellate courts don't make findings.                     That's why I'm curious --                    I thought -- I've been looking, too.      I thought 18A does say that they had $46 million of sales attributable to Lexis/Nexis.                    No, only 46 million.                    It said 46, not hundreds of millions.

All right.    So if you bring -- you'd at least bring them both, right, because --                  -- 1981 allows you to get out of the Title VII cap on damages?                  Or isn't that rendering Congress' careful -- I mean the 1991 legislation was a careful compromise.                    In exchange for the expansions of Title VII, they put caps on the damages.     You would allow them to keep the expansion, but do away with the caps.                   Well, you're just begging the question.        You're assuming you have the right that's at issue here today.                   Well then, why do they put the caps in?      I mean, I do think that is a limitation on the remedy they provided.                 They provided a damage remedy with a very clear cap and it's not a particularly generous cap, either.                  And you would allow them to completely obliterate that cap under any case that could be brought under 1981.                  When you agreed with Justice Breyer that we're looking for a word that couldn't be there, you said yes, but it is in fact a word that is there in about 37 other statutes, right?                  The word could be there.     I'm not saying whether it has to be there or not.     But it certainly could be there, and it's not here.                   Yes.                   But they provide a specific cause of action for retaliation, correct?                   Is this -- the question I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well. I think you have a case under Sullivan, which recognized, although it's 1982, this type of action. But Sullivan would not come out the same way today given Alexander against Sandoval and our new approach to statutory interpretation.            So if you're concerned about stare decisis, which body of law do you give effect to, the Sullivan case or our more recent cases on how to read statutes?                  Of course, by 1991 our new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly established.                  So if Congress were looking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't the normal care be for it to put in a retaliation provision?                     To the extent your argument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and read it, and rather than an implied right of action case it looked to me like a third party standing case.                   But I think -- that's right.   Now I get back to another stare decisis question.   Do I rely on what Sullivan actually said, or I do I rely on Jackson's reinterpretation of Sullivan?                   You agree, though, that the language in the opinion focuses on it as a third party standing question.                   Thank you, Counsel. General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT                   So, if you have --                   If you have an employer who fires everybody who complains about practices at work, that would not be covered retaliation?                   Do you think it's unusual for employers to have a practice that anybody who alleges that I've committed a violation of Federal law, I want to get rid of them?                   You don't have any doubt that Sullivan would come out differently today under our current analysis?                   The correct reading of Jackson or of Sullivan?
06-1456 +++$+++                      Ms. Schertler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Why isn't that enough?    If, for example, he's being -- he thinks he's being watched by law enforcement because they know he's up to something, but his brother isn't, why isn't that concealing?                  During the course of the transportation.     That is not what you say in your brief.   I'm looking at page 41 and what you say is:                "If no independent evidence establishes that concealment or disguising of the pertinent attribute of the proceeds would occur at the point of destination, then a factfinder would lack a reasonable basis for inferring that the transportation was designed to conceal or disguise." In other words, in the hypothetical Justice Scalia just gave -- in other words everybody knows he's a drug dealer, he spends the money -- there is no concealment or disguising the pertinent attribute at the point of destination.                  So there is no money laundering if they conceal the proceeds in a suitcase that's in the trunk of the car?              Is that enough?                  Is that concealing the money?                  Does use of a suitcase provide that evidence?                   When I use a suitcase I'm using it to carry my clothes, not to conceal them.                    So if this fellow were driving to Canada would that be a different case, because Canada does not have the sort of cash economy we've heard about in Mexico?                    So, what if the fellow says:   You know, there are dangerous roads between here and Mexico.          I'm hiding the money so that if, you know, a gang comes up they don't find it.                     And you say:   No, we think you're hiding it because it's illegal proceeds?    Is that enough to get to the jury?                   How many co-sponsors were there?                      Why don't you finish your answer?

06-1463 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brunstad. ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Normally we say that those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to decide.   The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the existing law as well as a court, and if that's the theory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law as well as an agency?                   Right, you at least have that additional step.           It is -- particularly since you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to compel. You can't even wait to see if your opponent goes to superior court and -- well, if he has won, he wouldn't go into court.        But you have to go to the court to get a motion to compel?          You can't just go ahead and proceed with arbitration.                   And if you -- and if you are successful and get from the superior court an order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then appeal it, I assume.                   Counsel, do you --

He did it because the foreign country requires him --                  Counsel, is your recent discussion about what happened here go simply to, I guess, your alternative argument, that we should affirm because you're right, regardless of who bears the burden; or does it really go to the legal question before us?
06-1509 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Cline. Ms. Maynard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Well, the court didn't let the taxpayer submit evidence.                   He came forward and said:    Look, there's an issue here despite the return of capital.        I would have thought at that point the burden shifted to you again.                   That burden -- having met that burden of production or at least tried to, the burden would shift to you to show, no, it's not a return of capital, it's a dividend.                   He said in his proffer that he would present expert testimony that this -- the corporation didn't have profits and earnings, and therefore it was a return of capital.                  And the district court said no, you don't get to do that.                   Right.                   No.   I mean, the district court -- the district court said that's not relevant, it's not relevant whether they could be classified as dividends.         I'm quoting from your brief on page 8:   "It is not relevant whether the funds could have been classified as a return of capital or a dividend at the time when they were diverted," because, he said, what was relevant is -- is the intent, whether they were in fact treated as return of capital.                   Well, but if he is making a profit and it depends upon whether or not there's adequate earnings or not, isn't he plainly saying that that means it's with respect to my stock? Because if he were getting it, for example, as an employee for consideration, it wouldn't matter whether there was sufficient earnings or not.                    But when he says it depends on whether there's sufficient earnings, it seems to me that that's clearly notifying you that he's saying it's with respect to his stock.                   This is a criminal case.     He's presented the argument, but don't you have the burden of showing as an element of tax deficiency that what he's proffering there is not true?                   That's not right. He says right here that it may or may not be income depending on a fact, not an expert's opinion, whether or not HIE had earnings and profits for the years when the moneys were obtained by Boulware.                 That's a question of fact.    You look at the corporate books.                You get the accountant on to testify.           It's not an expert's view on what's legally relevant.                   It's not totally relevant if the question he is trying to submit, whether they are earnings or profits or not, which will affect its treatment.   It's only relevant if it's with respect to stock.                     Well, please --
06-157 +++$+++                     Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Pincus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                    Well, that's -- I guess that's my first question.                I don't understand under your theory why any taxpayer couldn't sue our Marshal for standing up and saying "God save the United States and this honorable Court."                  Her salary comes from Congress.    You can trace that under your traceability requirement.    So any taxpayer under your theory could bring that lawsuit.                      It's very -- I can identify it.     It's the appropriations that Congress extends to this Court that pay the salary of the Marshal.                     Take Justice Breyer's Pilgrim church.                 Under your theory, if the grant was to erect a memorial and suitable museums or whatever at Plymouth, Plymouth Rock, then there wouldn't be an identifiable sum if the Government said, hey, let's use some of this money to build a church?                     The Government singles it out.   By that you mean the executive who's implementing it, as opposed to Congress?                     How do they -- in other words, if they spend the money are they singling it out?   If it turns out it costs a million dollars to build the little Pilgrim church is that an identifiable sum singled out that would satisfy your requirement?                  Well, it doesn't have to be a grant, just that you can say it costs so much money.                  Yes.                     So if we rule in your favor, then every Government agency has to make sure that whatever activities they undertake are part of a broader office?    They don't set up a separate White House office.   They just run it out of the White House office.                     It's purely -- a purely formalistic distinction.                    Well, that would decide whether it's central or not.                    If you have a White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, then you can say it's central to it.                   If it's just the White House office, then the argument would be, no, that's not central.     They do a lot of other stuff as went.                    But the Marshall in both --                    We're trying to decide whether it is central.            You have to decide what unit you're looking at before deciding whether the activity is central.      And you're just saying well, just look at the people who are doing the offensive activity, and it's obviously going to be central to what they're doing.                   If Justice Stewart agreed completely with what the Court said, why did he write a separate opinion?                   And just to add to the question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional stage.   In other words, this would be litigation over whether the individual taxpayer has standing.                 The Court would first have to determine whether the activity you're challenging is incidental or not.                   Maybe they're reading Flast different than you read it.                 There are not a lot of these challenges because you don't have standing under Flast.                   Well, what would happen if --                   Well then, five meetings isn't enough.         How many?                   20?                   Again -- I asked this before, and I think you were cut off before you had a chance.    Incidental with respect to what?                All of the money for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast, a particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is it incidental to however many times the President has breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?                   So even if the expenditure is very small, but to take a particular religious symbol that might be offensive to some other people, is that incidental because the meeting went on longer and cost more than the particular religious symbol?                   So if it was 2 dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious symbol?                  Of course.    But the point is that makes --                  But that shows how totally manipulable your incidental test is.                     You just have to phrase your claim so that it covers whatever expenditure --   -- is offending you. It's not -- incidental doesn't protect you from frivolous or insignificant claims in any way.

YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   What -- what more could Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes what was alleged in this case?                   Well, how can the fact that what led to the statement change the characterization of the statement?                She can initiate it, go in and say, "I oppose what's going on," or if somebody just asks her, you know, "how do you feel about what's going on," she says she opposes it.                It seems to me in either case you look at the statement and not what led to the statement.                     That's why my hypothetical uses the word "oppose."                      In the first case, she goes in of own volition and says, "I oppose"; in the second case, she says "I oppose" in response to a question.   Congress used the word "oppose," and my hypothetical in both cases used the word "oppose."                     Right.    Well, is it real a magic word?      She comes in and says, "you won't believe" -- you know -- "you think that's bad, wait till I tell you what he did to me," and goes on tells -- it's quite obvious from the context that she opposes it.                   I'm sorry.   Please finish your answer.                     I thought Faragher and Ellerth --                     I thought Faragher and Ellerth were limited to the hostile work environment cases.                   Well -- well, that's a different question.      Is the defense we recognized in Ellerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment case or in the specific action case as well?                      You're not going to win -- you're not going to win this case; you're going to settle if you lose up here, right?                   My point is simply that the incentive system is skewed because if you lose you pay not only your attorneys' fees but the complainants'.   If you win, you have to incur yours.                   I'm not saying it shouldn't be.    But in terms of the pressures towards settlement, it is a very strong incentive.
06-1646 +++$+++                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Isn't it pertinent, Mr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum term of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're dealing with a statute that itself is directed to recidivism.     You're asking -- you've got three previous convictions and then you get a particularly harsh sentence.     If recidivism is what you're trying to address, it would seem to me in deciding what a maximum term is that it would be natural to assume that they would take recidivism into consideration in that context as well.                   Well, but it just seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism, they would think that that's a problem that should be taken into account in determining what maximum sentences you're subject to under State law.                    Counsel, you --                   Well, we know it was focusing on the particular problem of recidivism. That's what the overarching Federal statute is directed to.                   And I think, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists presented particular problems that were different from the one particular offense.                   Well, but the flip side of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of marijuana.    It's the same offense as somebody who's done it and been convicted of it three different times.                   I mean, I don't think your hypothetical helps advance the argument.                      Counsel, if you were representing a -- a defendant who has two prior convictions for something that has a sentence of 8 years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing? Would you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him it's 15 years?                    Counsel, the Government of course responds to your rule of lenity argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we are talking about how -- the degree of sentencing rather than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction in the first place.                    But someone who is, you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the rule of lenity is a little bit -- it's not the same as somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a crime at all, because it's so vaguely written.                    Well, we know -- we know that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in a case like this; it's just a question of for how long.                    It is -- it is a fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that you would say in a particular case that the maximum to which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that person is in fact sentenced to 15 years.                   It's just the -- the words don't fit together under that argument.                    Well, no, I thought their argument was you look at broad categories rather than individual characteristics.                It's not a one-way ratchet at all.                    Thank you, counsel.
06-1666 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Margulies? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH MARGULIES ON BEHALF OF MUNAF, ET AL. AND OMAR, ET AL.                  Did General MACArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in Japan?  bright line that determines whether there's habeas jurisdiction or not?                   So the control in the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign national allows -- creates habeas jurisdiction?                    That's your bright line?                   Well, then it's not just control.   It looks to citizenship, which brings up the questions Justice Stevens was raising.                  So that's pretty far removed from the bright line.             I mean, now you've got to decide whether it's in the zone of hostilities or not. You've got to decide if this is within the time period that the Court should not exercise jurisdiction or not. And what's going to happen, of course, is that the district court is going to look at this and say, I can't decide all of that right away.              Let's enter an injunction, a preliminary injunction such as at issue here, while I decide these questions.                   And that's going to have the effect of intruding quite extensively on the exercise of executive authority.                   Let me try and move you to the merits.                   I had thought that the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge custody.   And it seems to me that the last thing your clients want in this case is to be released.                   You don't want the district court to say you win, you can be released tomorrow at noon.                   Well, I thought you wanted to block the transfer.              I mean, the Iraqi authorities can pick him up at the gate.                  I thought the relief that was awarded by the district court also enjoined prosecution.                   You want -- I'm sorry.   I just want to make sure I understand.                 You want the relief in both of these cases to be, okay, we will release him tomorrow at noon?              And by the way, we're going to notify the Iraqi authorities because we think we're releasing a dangerous criminal and want to make sure they have the opportunity to do whatever they want?                  And don't tell --                  And don't tell the Iraqis where that's going to be?                   Well, that's within the executive's discretion.             I want to know if you are saying that the district court in this case can require the custodian not simply to release the person, but to release them somewhere else and to keep the point at which they're going to release someone whose been determined by the MNF-I tribunal to be a dangerous criminal, to keep the point of his release secret from the Iraqi government.                   Okay.   Now the determination that the transfer would be unlawful, I -- again, I get back -- maybe I'm repeating myself.                 I have always understood habeas to be concerned with custody, rather than this broad range of determinations about what's lawful and unlawful, other than as are necessary to rule on the question of custody. In other words, of course, if there's been a Fourth Amendment violation, you bring a habeas action, you determine whether the custody is lawful or not. Here you want a determination whether the transfer is unlawful or not.                     Whether it does or does not, I just question whether habeas is an appropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's not concerned with the legality of transfer; it's concerned with the legality of custody.                  So if you had filed it -- if you had filed it six months rather than a year after, would there be habeas jurisdiction.                  You see where I'm going.   Three months?                  The bright line is getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned.                  Mr. Margulies, let me make sure there are no other questions.  Mr. Margulies. Thank you, Your Honor.  minutes.
06-1717 +++$+++                   Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     You say the relevant one was of course on a legislation that wasn't passed, right?                  Well and it might be quite different for private practitioner.                  Your benefits for health care will probably cost you a lot less than private practice and doesn't that make the paralegal fees quite different than the other items of expenses that are listed?    You know, expert witnesses, you get a bill, that's how much it costs the lawyer.                  Studies, analysis, engineering reports, you don't have to figure overhead benefits with respect to any of those.                  All of a sudden you throw in another item, paralegal costs, you put those under costs, and now you've got to go through this elaborate calculation that is going to be not worth it, almost, for a typical firm representing a small client.                  Well, in most firms an engineering report would be outside the --                      Well, but that wasn't Justice Kennedy's question.                   His was the outsourced paralegal is better at a particular task.                      Counsel, your -- this question only arises when the position of your client was not substantially justified.                 Now under those -- and it was designed, to some extent, to penalize you because -- because of that fact.                 Why should we adopt a construction that, in effect, penalizes the client who has had to face the Federal Government when the Federal Government's position was not substantially justified?            They are going to have to pay the paralegal fees at market rates, but they are only goes to get compensation at cost.                    It's kind of a stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law that only applies to individuals or small businesses where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate. I suspect that was not foremost in their mind.                   Well, it assumes that when they said "costs," that they meant costs to the firm as opposed to costs to the client.                And that, I think, is entirely an open question.                   Not to belabor the point it meant that the people who drafted the Senate report may have meant that.                   Do we know what the President's view was on that question when he signed the legislation into law, which is what he was required to do before it became law and which he did not do under the prior bill?                   Well, maybe this is the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't -- I didn't grasp the answer.         Under your system it would make sense for lawyers to charge separately for photocopy services, telephone services, so on because then they are not going to be subject to the attorney fee cap.   And they may think, look, the difference between cost and market rate is relatively small; the difference between our hourly rate and $125 is large.                   Well, I'm just saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be, I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for things at a higher rate than their cost?                 They will charge higher rate for photocopy services because they try to factor into it overhead and things like than cost.                   Well, I would say -- I would say that it's now traditional for firms to charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it cost them.                    Well, I think you missed my point.   It was even if you're right, 50 cents and they can only charge 15 cents, they have an incentive to separately charge for photocopying, because they get the 15 cents, and otherwise it's going to -- they are going to lose it over the cap if you say no that's part of the attorney's fees.                   Counsel, there are occasions, aren't there, when the government is entitled to attorney's fees?                   Do you know how you bill paralegal times -- time in those situations?                  You often don't bill them separately.

How are newly discovered flaws dealt with?    I mean, say where you have this catheter, and the FDA didn't look at the possibility of allergic reactions to the balloon plastic, and all of a sudden it turns out to be a serious problem. How can you say that that's preemptive?                  You -- you agree that that was not preemptive.                  Mr. Olson, I'm looking at the Government's brief on page 4 which says that in the annual reports, the -- the manufacturer has to disclose unpublished reports of data from clinical investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies involving the device. So presumably that includes any nonclinical laboratory studies that the manufacturer itself conducted.                   Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S.

TRIBE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  If they finally canceled it, how did it -- I mean, if it runs with the land, they don't have the authority to cancel.                  Well, you say -- you call it punishment, but in fact the government's position on each of these particulars has generally been vindicated.    When your client has appealed, they've upheld the trespass citations.               When you've sued for malicious prosecution, the suit's been rejected.                  Which of the government actions do you not have an existing remedy for, apart from the Racketeer and Corrupt -- RICO Act or the, this new Bivens claim?                  Can you point to any one governmental action for which you do not have an existing remedy?                  You have a malicious prosecution claim for that.           You brought that, you lost.                  You could have brought one.                   Well, if the position of the Government were more fairly represented they would say, we don't want everyone to be able to claim that everything we're doing under color of law is retaliation, because then we'll hear that against IRS agents, we'll hear it against OSHA agents.               So long as you -- and their position is you have a remedy for everything you're complaining about, and you invoked some of them and you lost, you didn't invoke others and so you didn't prevail.      But don't create a whole new remedy just because you're dissatisfied with having to pursue each one individually.                    You say this clearly establishes.    Are the BLM folks supposed to have known about Willett versus Devoy?                    -- as clearly establishing their liability for what you call extortion?     I'm sure what they would call trying to save the taxpayers money and getting the type of reciprocal agreement with this landowner that they have got with thousands of others.                    You agree if the case were otherwise -- and I gather we have a factual dispute on that -- that it would have been all right?                   I mean, if he didn't have this other easement already, but they were trying to negotiate it, that this type of playing hardball, I guess is one way to put it, would be all right?                    Well, that's what I'm trying to get, to see if you agree with that.                   In other words, everything about this case would otherwise be, I'm sure not breaking the laws, but otherwise it would be all right if they were trying to get a reciprocal easement?                    But are they disabled from negotiating?          If they go up to somebody and say, you know, we'd really like a right-of-way because we have some interest in lands that we need to maintain on the other side, and the person says, no and, you know, get off my property, do they have to shrug their shoulders and say all right?                 Or can they say, well, you know, we're neighbors, we have a lot of interests in common and we should work together?                   Is that all of a sudden extortion?                  So how many trespass --                  -- citations for his cattle does it take before it's all of a sudden extortion?                  And he challenged the citations and they were rejected.                   No.    A, an action against the Government for ramming your sailboat is directly responsive to that.            You get -- you get full recovery.                   You don't need the Constitution to the sue the Government for ramming your sailboat.   Basic state tort law.                   You can answer. (A little laughter.)                  Thank you, Counsel.
06-278 +++$+++                     Mr. Mertz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS K. MERTZ, ESQ. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    It's a case about money.   Your client wants money from the principal personally for her actions in this case.                    But there's a broader issue of whether principals and teachers around the country have to fear that they're going to have to pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take actions pursuant to established board policies that they think are necessary to promote the school's educational mission.                    And you think it was clearly established that she had to allow a student at a school- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus"?                      But can't the school decide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent its student from engaging in drug use and so that it's going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint is going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it takes a particular view with respect to signs that in their view seem to encourage drug use?                  So your position would be different if this were in the student gym and they were having a discussion.              There was a program to discourage drug use and he held up his sign; you would say it would be all right to take down the sign inside the school gym?                  So it doesn't matter that this is outside.      It matters on the content of the sign, not the location?                   So it's a political -- even assuming it's a political issue, the question is whether the school has to say our classrooms, our field trips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a forum for that debate?                   And disruption does not include undermining the message they want to send? It has to be some type of physical disruption.                But undermining the message they want to send, they can't make the judgment that that's not allowed?                  Does the school have to be completely neutral in that respect?                  Does it have to punish who says that was a good program, I'm not going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because he's taking position on a public issue?                   Where does that notion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I thought we wanted our schools to teach something, including something besides just basic elements, including the character formation and not to use drugs. They have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs or not?                    Why did he go where he went?                    Why did he choose that location to unfurl his banner?                  I think it's --                   Can we get back -- I'm sorry.                   Can we get back to what the case is about.         You think the law was so clearly established when this happened that the principal, that the instant that the banner was unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is coming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I can only take the sign down if it's disruptive.                  But then under Frazier I can do something if it interferes with the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got this other thing.    So she should have known at that point that she could not take the banner down, and it was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own pocket because of it.                     And so it should be perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and couldn't do.                    That gets back to the point I was trying to make earlier.                  He came here because it was the school event, the school sponsored activity.   He could have gone anywhere along the route. He knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that they were going to be, the students were going to be released to see it.      He went to join up with the school even if he were truant that day.
06-313 +++$+++                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blume? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                    That was objected to and the objection was sustained, correct?                    Which in that case, AEDPA says we look to clearly established law by our U.S. Supreme Court decisions.             Which is the clearest U.S. Supreme Court decision that was violated here?                   Well, pick which one do you think is the most directly applicable.                   It's not Romano. Romano was an introduction of evidence case, right?                   My point is simply the level of generality at which the guiding principles were articulated, which helps when you're applying it, but in determining -- it is the point Judge Bowman in dissent that when you don't have a case that's close, that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to the Court, because it's not a clearly established precedent of the Supreme Court. Yes, there are the Jenner cases that establish the general principles, but the question is how clearly those were contravened before you can say it violated clearly established law.                   So Judge -- Judge Bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor?                 He dissented; he thought these were not unreasonable on the basis of on clearly established law.                   The standard is unreasonable in light of clearly established law.                  Well no, he specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours and that there these other generally applicable decisions and he thought the state courts had broad -- a broader range when there was no decision on all fours.                  I'm reading at the bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.                   To -- to send a message?                   What the defense lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote for life, you are sending a message.                   He said if you vote for life, you are still doing your duty.                   How was that message -- a different message, I guess, but he can say send a message, but the prosecutor can't?                   Your recital was not a complete picture of the case.              This was an assassination of a witness in a Federal drug prosecution, with how many shots to the head?                   Six.   And the jury determined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that this was the guy who did it.            So you do have to look at the penalty phase in the context of those facts.                    What do you -- what should a prosecutor's closing -- penalty phase argument look like?   What are the sorts of things that he should be talking about?                  Of course, the defense argument was not focused on Weaver either.                   The defense counsel said it was a vote for life, fight for it.   Always fight for life, always, always.                 The argument by the defense wasn't -- and it's hard for me to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't extend beyond the particular individuals.
06-340 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Glitzenstein? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC R. GLITZENSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                  That's not quite right.    They would look at that in the context of reviewing the permits that are issued by the State agencies.                  No, what he's suggesting is there isn't going to be any impact on any endangered species until a particular permit is issued by the State agency, and that those permits are submitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service for their review.                   What does that have to do with the -- I'm sorry.                   But the point -- the point is that it's the issuance of a permit under the program, whether administered by the Federal Government or the State government that has the potential for jeopardizing endangered species.                It is not the administration of the program.               And EPA has in place the procedures to allow them to review the particular permits, which what is what might jeopardize an endangered species.      And they don't need to leverage their limited authority, their non-discretionary authority to approve a transfer, to have that authority to review the actual act that might jeopardize an endangered species.                   So what is -- is there any limitation?     Let's say that EPA says we're all set to approve this transfer, except OSHA sent us a letter and they don't like the occupational safety rules you have at the State environmental agency; so until you change those rules, or enter a memorandum of agreement that you're going to change those rules, we're not going to approve the transfer.                   Yeah, like the OSHA act.     It says, you know, the states should do this, and they're not doing it.        So EPA can leverage their approval into any area of law?                   But sometimes states say no.     So if they say no, presumably they're going to have to impose the obligation as a condition of approval.                   Yes.                   Jeopardy from the issuance of a prospective future issuance of a permit by Arizona if they get the delegated authority.                And that issuance of the permit would be subject to objection and review by EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service.                  The position that EPA has taken.                  Under their authority.                  So how does it matter whether they have it or if it's transferred to Arizona?                   Thank you, counsel.
06-376 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Redding. Mr. Marcus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN L. MARCUS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   But what the cases said prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest abatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to consider that claim.        They would just say there's no standard to apply, so it's committed to agency discretion by law.      Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes along and gives you a standard, so that removes that objection.    What's wrong with that?                      Well, that's because of the way that Congress enacted the language.                       It doesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court shall have jurisdiction.           It says the tax court shall have jurisdiction.      That is a, in many respects a preferred forum and they're saying you can bring it there as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction that the prior courts had recognized.                      Don't you think it's kind of strange, though, if you have the interest abatement is available only for a particular category of taxpayer and not others?                      If you have a net worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.                   Right, but you abate it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.                   That's what I thought, too.   But then your friend explained that in the initial bill is where the interest is contained in a lot of these cases and in this case in particular.                 So it's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in advance to stop the accrual of interest.                 Just you get the bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000 dollars and 300 of it is interest.                    The difference -- the difference is that the district court, the claims court already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims, if you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund.                 And so this isn't as if we're looking at something that says the tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as a wedge to get other jurisdiction.                 There's already a grant of jurisdiction.       The problem was, there was no standard of review for these may abate claims, and all of a sudden we find in this provision there is a standard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that fills the void.   Why can't they just use that?                   But I thought what you had argued before when people would try to seek this release was that there's no standard of review to hold the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.                   But one thing you never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because there is jurisdiction in the district court.               If you've paid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can bring a refund action.                   Can they bring it as additional claim after they get the final determination? They start a whole separate action for interest abatement?                   Is it part of the same proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?                   You're making the claim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the district court to get your refund and then go to the tax court to get the interest abatement, which does seem like a big deal to me.         And you say, well, in the tax court you have to do it separately, too.

SUZANNE LEE ELLIOTT, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                    But that's the beginning of the questioning, isn't it?                   It is not the end of it.     It is surely not the law that just, whenever a juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that he's automatically -- has to be seated?                    After several times saying the only time he would consider it is if the person is going to reoffend.              I mean, if he just gets the right answer once out of six times and it's the last time, is the judge required to ignore the prior colloquy?                    But look at page -- look at page 262.    He says, you know, could -- could you -- when do you think the death penalty is appropriate?   If the person would reviolate if released.                    There are others.                   What if the -- what if the voir dire -- what if the juror said just what he said on a few occasions, that I would consider it if the person would reviolate?        And that was all.           That would be a basis for excusing him?                     You don't go as far as Judge Kozinski? (Laughter.)                   Now on the that, just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea that he must kill again before imposing the death penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing him?                   Yeah.    How many paraded by?    I mean, do we know?                     In your view, do we look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we were looking at this on direct review?                  So that makes a difference in the standard of review that we apply in this case?                  So, does that mean we give a greater degree of deference?                  I'm just trying to get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of review with respect to deference to the State court is different in this respect than it would be on direct review?                  I thought your brother made the point that there was a more elaborate explanation of the trial judge's determinations when there had been an objection.                   Substantially impaired.                   Which is a lot different than irrevocably committed.                   You would agree that substantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably committed?                     Well, there's a third choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State court decision to which we should defer.                     Yes.                     On page 208, though, the Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard, as I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views would have prevented or substantially impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions.

It's at least a little awkward for you to say we should wait for a case in which it's been fully presented when the argument you're making here wasn't fully presented, or at least not decided below.       I understood the court of appeals' decision to be based on its determination that there was no deceptive act because there was no statement or omission.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER, ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                    You're talking about the Federal act or the Maine act?                   Could I follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail because the terms of it are pre-emptive?                    Well, see, you are -- you are pretty familiar with the New York settlement then. (Laughter.)                    Well, then I think you ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's pre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not.

06-480 +++$+++                   Mr. Coykendall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. COYKENDALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   What is your main objection to -- I mean, it's hard to propose a rule of reason.    Why, why can't the rule of reason work to promote the objectives you've just articulated?                   Well, I thought the Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that it made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where something other than price is important, and they have to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.                  Why is that?   Why can't -- eliminating the rule, I thought the whole point was they would just put in their contracts, you have to sell it at this price, and they could enforce the contracts, rather than having to have these machinations of making sure they don't do anything that looks like an agreement with their retailers.                      Why would you argue that those are more efficient than resale price maintenance?                      Well, you can add the contractual provisions you were talking about to a contract that has a minimum resale price.                   The minimum resale price is to take away the incentive from the retailer not to carry through on the non-price aspects.                    Your reference to the will of Congress, they haven't enacted legislation that supports the result you seek.                    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Underwood? ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD ON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT                  Well, it's also been settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more inefficiently.    Doesn't it make sense to allow them to adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already completely legal?                  But of course, they could always pass a law saying that if their intent is so clear.   They didn't do that here.                    But they could.   I mean, you could easily write the agreement saying you have to charge this much and because you have to charge this much you also have to provide the training, the service, whatever the non-price inducements are.                    But then the retailer, but then the retailer might have a real incentive not to do a good job on the service because they really want to market it for price, not for service.                    Well, but there you have the free rider problem, which is you go to the fancy show room, you figure out what you want, and then you buy it at the discount store.                   And that no longer is applicable?
06-484 +++$+++                      Thank you Mr. Shanmugam. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR R.                    MILLER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                   You're arguing the facts and the inferences.            You said the Seventh Circuit got it right.    As I read their articulation of the standard on page 20A of the petition appendix, it's the normal standard that would have been applied prior to the passage of the PSLRA.         Could a reasonable person infer -- Congress passes a law saying they've got to give rise to a strong inference.              Shouldn't that have changed the standard?                   I don't understand the Seventh Amendment argument here.                   Congress can surely articulate the standard that's going to be applied as a matter of substantive law.                  If Congress says, you have to prove by clear and convincing evidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh Amendment because a jury would be instructed pursuant to that standard.                     I thought you told me that Congress could set a high level of burden on factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the Seventh Amendment.                     Are you saying that Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is different than preponderance of the evidence.                    If I'm with you so far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a different standard on the motion to dismiss than they meant to apply at the merits standard?                    Well, then what was Congress trying to do when they said strong inference? It seems to me that if you think the standards have to be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no Seventh Amendment problem.                   But all of those cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to me, established a very different standard.                 They said they have to support a strong inference.                   Strong inference was not the test that was being applied in Anderson, Liberty Lobby, in any of those cases.                     How does that change how we should read strong inference in the statute?                    Are you saying don't worry whether it's a strong inference or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and they're not going to bring a frivolous case?                   No. Congress said there has to be a strong inference.                    And what concerns me is that the very standard that the Seventh Circuit articulated said simply could a reasonable person infer.           The notion of strong inference isn't in that standard at all.                   Just okay?                   Okay, you two are even now. (Laughter.)                   Trial worthy under preponderance standard or trial worthy under the strong inference standard?                   I'm sorry. Justice Stevens, say it again.

MOODY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Counsel, if the State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously, how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas?                     You would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?                   That seems awfully refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses?                        Is this an -- is this an unreasonable application of Chapman?   And then apply the Brecht standard after determining that it was an unreasonable application of Chapman?                  Do you think the question of the application of Brecht is included within the questions presented?                     Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT                   I suppose if we're going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would have to do the same thing.

In other words, if he came back and said, was my notice of appeal timely or something, and the judge at that point ruled, then it might come under that provision.               But this is just -- prospectively, he could have filed this timely even after the judge issued the order.                In other words, he could have filed it on the 14th day.                    He didn't have to wait until the 17th day.                   That would be the very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique circumstances doctrine. (Laughter.)                    You can finish your answer.                     Thank you, Mr. Marshall.                   You're sure habeas cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather than criminal?                     Looking at the rule, it does require these findings.               Has that been interpreted to require that they be written on the record or is that simply something that's supposed to guide the district court?

They left Federal court having lost on the permanent injunction.                     Their legal, their legal claim was that these regulations were invalid under the First Amendment.           And they lost on that legal claim.                  Well, they succeeded in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get attorney's fees for that, because they were successful at the filing complaint stage.                  All the work you did to show irreparable harm, balance of the equities, not on the merits, you're saying that's off the table?                   Counsel, your approach, just as there are problems from the judicial economy perspective with your friend's approach, but doesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth and nail on the preliminary injunction because they're running the risk if they lose there, they're going to pay fees even if they prevail later?                    As opposed to, as is often the case, they might say, you know, we consent to the entry of the preliminary injunction or we don't -- you know, we're going to save our energy. Doesn't it require them to fight every possible stage, including appeal and so on?                     Well, he doesn't have to say he's wrong.            What often happens is as it is here, he say's I've got 24 hours, I don't have a brief from the other side, I kind of make the best guess I can.   And then later on after an adversary presentation and an evidentiary hearing, he issues a different ruling.     As here, he doesn't have to say I was wrong on my 24-hour off-the-cuff guess.                  It's just that I'm better informed.       Is that repudiation or not?                   Did the court order provide for a screen?                  So the State prevailed to some extent as well.                They prevailed to the extent of getting in the order that they can do what they had done, which is erect a screen.                  So they're entitled to some -- I mean, if -- this is not a reciprocal switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as well.                  You can't go into court with the objective of just getting preliminary relief, can you?    I mean, you have to have an underlying claim of illegality and, that seeks permanent relief, right?                  Knowing that --                  -- preliminary injunction.                  On the February 14th, but your client sought further relief.                  I know you were asked this question and your answer may have just slipped by me.    Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why would you not be entitled to fees on that?                   No.   I thought you prevailed in the sense that you secured relief.                       That's how you articulated it up to this point.                  The State did make a point, that they were kind of -- this was short notice and they were doing the best they could on short notice. I mean, they showed up but only sort of.                   But the regulations told you weren't allowed to protest nude.                  Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    Well, but there's nothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair.                   It turns out that the Union Oil Company is bankrupt and in part of the settlement they agreed to turn over all the documents listing whoever it was that gave them the chemicals.   And it's a very complicated thing because we're dealing with people often in these cases that don't have assets and only limited responsible parties have the assets.   So they're trying to recover what they can from the others.                  As you read the statute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other person doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?                   You could set up a company that cleans up these sites, right, and go traveling around the country and clean them up and then send people a bill and cite your reading of 1074(b), right?                   Well, if we rule in your favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?                   What about non-PRPs?                   Thanks, Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Geck. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY D.

Well, let's say -- let's say you have a duel, and each person in the duel needs to have a weapon.          One person has a gun; the other person has the sword.        Would you say the person with the sword is using the gun in the duel?                     Because you can't have a duel without both people having weapons.                     You wouldn't say that the person --                  Each person in the drug exchange brings to the table what they've got.                 The one has the drugs; the other brings the gun.                 That doesn't mean that the person with the drugs is using the gun.                   It cuts the other way.   Congress knows how to say involved in if it wants to reach that broadly, and it didn't do it under the provision in which -- pursuant to which Mr. Watson was indicted.                    So if Congress passes a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime of violence gets an additional sentence, the person who is shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?                    So is that a necessary element of the offense:                  That the transaction be negotiated in advance?                   I don't think -- I don't see how your hypothetical advances the argument. I mean, I don't necessarily agree that someone who sells drugs for currency is using the currency in the transaction.    They are accepting it.                    It is what they want.    That's not the same as using it.                    Well, that's what weakens your hypothetical.            It's not the normal use of a gun as a medium of exchange.                    It held that the person who does use the gun, which is the natural, grammatical construction, uses the firearm.                That's quite a bit different than the question of whether someone who receives it as the consideration is using the firearm.                  Well, I just -- I don't understand the significance of the argument you just made.   Are you saying that because some people might be let out of prison if we correctly construed the statute, we should read it your way?                  So what was your point referring to the people who were convicted under this statute --under this construction of the statute?                  I thought the argument you made earlier was that this may not be of particular ongoing significance because of the amendment.
06-5754 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                      Well, if you -- if you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with the same identical background and everything else, one judge says, I think military service should be taken into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines by 3 years.    The judge next door says, I don't think it should be taken into account so I'm going to impose the guideline sentence.      Both cases are appealed.               They're consolidated for argument.           What is the court of appeals supposed to do?    Uphold both of them?                   What if the court of appeals does that?      What if the court of appeals says we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of them do not take military service into account, one does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the interest in uniformity.          And so even though that one judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?                    I don't know how terribly different it is than the normal review for abuse of discretion.      I mean, you don't even need two judges in my earlier question.              Let's say you have the same judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant who comes before him he says, I think if you have military service, you should get a reduction.              And then all of a sudden he says, I see you have military service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction.                I mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard to be a little bit consistent?              And if that's the only type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure some degree of consistency in how similar individuals are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises any concern.                  Or presumably the further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from the guidelines range?      If you've got a submission here 18 compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the guidelines, and you get one sentence from the district court saying -- you know -- I followed the guidelines, presumably that would be the same as a significant departure without further justification?

How -- putting aside -- putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible interpretation of the statute?                  What employment would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in if not domestic service employment?                  Ought not to get as much deference from the courts.                      So why are you sure there's a conflict in the first place?                       You know, 552.3 says that the term domestic service employment refers to services performed in the home of the employer.                       It doesn't say it only refers to that.                       And then you go down and 109 says it also includes employees who are employed by a third party. I mean, can't they be reconciled in that way.                      It's not the way the Agency has done it.       But you don't think we should defer to them, anyway.   So -- (Laughter.)                  Yeah, but it says it refers to something.       It doesn't say as many of these regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined as. And particularly when you're confronted with what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to should be read to mean includes rather than is defined as.                  Well it is interesting when you look at -- I mean, they're -- it's a good point.     It's interesting when you look at the other definitions, the babysitting, it says this provision shall mean.        Here it just says it refers to. Let's see, the other ones -- casual basis, shall mean.     Companionship services, shall mean. This one doesn't say shall mean.                 It says it refers to this.     I'm just wondering if that's something that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as the other definitions.                   There it says --there it says includes.            And if you're talking about 552.101, there it says the term includes persons frequently referred to as private household workers.                  Thank you, Counsel.

DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    And if -- you're talking about Public Law 104-38?                    Well, they also said, quote, "The sentence imposed for trafficking in crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence for powder cocaine."                   Well, that's fine, but that's pretty far from 100 to 1.                    "Generally exceed," it suggests to me that Congress itself, in terms -- you are relying on this implicit directive from Congress.   And that's the latest expression of congressional implicit direction, and it just says "generally exceed."     So, you know, two to one.                   Well I know, but you are relying on an implicit directive anyway.                   So as you are looking at that vague direction, it seems to me that their last expression on what they wanted the Commission to do is more probative than a much older pre-existing 100 to 1 ratio.                   No, Mr. Dreeben, your office used to argue that when Congress wants to do something, there's a way to do it.                 They pass a law through both houses, then the President signs it. That's the only way they can give legal effect to their intent. Now you are arguing that there's some binding intent simply because they set mandatory minimums and mandatory maximums that carry beyond that. I'm wondering how that's consistent with the positions the office has taken before.                   We should read a negative pregnant in the Congress' vetoing of what the Commission wanted to do?                  Why doesn't Congress -- why didn't Congress, in fact, do what you say they implicitly did explicitly?                     They could impose the 100 to 1 ratio throughout as opposed to simply as a minimum and a maximum.       And they did not do that.
06-637 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Koerner. Mr. Gardephe. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. GARDEPHE, ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                     So you read -- hypothesize two statutes:           One, the statute before the phrase "who previously received special education" was added and the statute after?             You read both of those statutes the same way; right?                   I don't understand. You read "who previously received special education services," and you say that includes who previously did not receive special education services.                   There would be no reason for Congress to put that language in if the same right to reimbursement existed if the child had not previously received special education services.                   Because your friend reads that the exact opposite way and says, since (C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public school, that that's a limitation on how you should read (C)(ii).                   In that case, isn't it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says "Reimbursement for Private School Placement"?                   It doesn't say reimbursement for private school placement when the child previously attended public school.                   That just means that (C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues that might arise.     But that doesn't mean that it doesn't address exactly what its title says, "Reimbursement for Private School Placement."                  Where is that set forth?                  Were those provisions at issue when this dispute arose?                     They are the 2004 amendments --                  I suppose it's how broadly you read legislative history.                     I thought there was a statement by Representative Castle that this would limit the payments that school districts had to make.                   So when it comes to reimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place their child in the public school are in better shape than the parent who place their child in public school and then want to remove him.                   But cooperation does not require sending the child to the public school.                   Well in my case they would note have received any benefits, under the terms of the statute.                   That's why your friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make clear that the public school is -- whether it is or is not able to provide the appropriate public education.                   I mean, why would Congress have put the phrase in there -- even if it was describing as you say the most common situation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it doesn't serve that purpose at least?                   What you're saying is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going to be a hurdle in some cases.                   The useful purpose it serves is allow the school district to show what it can do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical statement, it allows some actual concrete practice to see if the plan that the public school has developed is going to work or not going to work, that the impartial hearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete setting.                   But then the whole point is the statute was then amended after Burlington. So to say what Burlington interpreted, it don't seem to me to be very compelling on the question of what the amended statute provided.                  You have review before the impartial hearing examiner about that alleged bad faith, correct?                  You have reviewed before the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on the part of the school district.                     And what was that primary mandate?                     There is no issue of mainstreaming in this case at all; right?                     Neither of the options are mainstream options?                      You know, it -- I'm sorry.                      So is mine.   Thank you, Mr. Gardephe.                      Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT                  So in a situation where it's not in the summer, where they say, well, let's see how it works, and then they go to the public school, I would have thought your argument also would say it's not -- they don't have to give notice of 10 business days because in Burlington you said you don't -- you have to make available the tuition reimbursement. They passed a statute imposing a limitation on that, 10 business days.                  You don't dispute that limitation.   You dispute the other one, though, which says they have to have previously received special-education services.                      Anywhere?   I thought Representative Castle said that this would result on easing the burden on the school districts to pay tuitions.                   But the whole point is you don't necessarily know it's inadequate until later in time.    Right?       The school board thinks it is adequate.

06-666 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Trower. Mr. Brunstad. ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Or United Haulers.                   So you want to suggest -- I'm sorry.                   Are you suggesting that the result in United Haulers would have been different if there were a competing trash processing facility out-of-State?                  Well, they are not taxing the out-of-State commodity.                 Their tax is imposed simply on Kentucky taxpayers.                      But our approach in the General Motors case was the exact opposite.                         There we couldn't figure out whether the market for natural gas was captive or not captive. It was a little of each, and we kind of said well, you know, if it's kind of a close question, leave it for Congress.   Because, after all, the Commerce Clause talks about Congress' power.                       The dormant Commerce Clause is not mentioned. So this is an area where Congress can regulate if it wants to, and it has never shown the slightest interest in interfering with State tax exemptions for their own bonds.                     It strikes me as much more fundamental, whether or not a State can issue a tax exemption for its -- its bonds.                    That seems more fundamental than the more specialized issues in those other cases. And I think we have said when you're dealing with a specialized issue that may not get the attention of Congress, we have a different approach.                  But it's not distinct from United Haulers.              Garbage is garbage, too.                  But the fact that bonds are bonds doesn't seem to me to be very responsive.                     Your argument that you just presented in response to Justice Stevens' question, I think, relies on the discrimination against the out-of-State issuers.                  Your clients are not out-of-State issuers.                  We don't have an overbreadth doctrine under the Commerce Clause.                Why aren't their arguments limited to discrimination against them rather than discrimination against out-of-State issuers?                  So your Kentucky taxpayers can argue about the discrimination against out-of-State bond issuers?                     How do we know that your clients will be better off regardless of how this case is resolved?    One way to resolve it, of course, would be to take away the Kentucky tax exemption, which would hurt your clients. Another way to resolve it would be to extend the tax exemption to the Ohio bonds, which may hurt your clients if the Kentucky bonds aren't competitive, and the price of the Kentucky bonds goes down.                  They are going to lose either way.                  But whether or not it benefits them, it seems to me, depends on how competitive they are with other States' municipal bonds. In other words, their advantage now comes from the tax exemption for Kentucky bonds; and it's not clear, if that is eliminated across the board, that Kentucky bonds are going to be competitive with, you know, bonds of whatever other State.                     So the value of them may go down, and your clients may lose, whether you win or not.                  I mean it -- it provides an advantage depending on the level of the State income tax and, I suppose, the level of the exemption.     It doesn't necessarily mean that that's the only bonds they are going to hold.                    And it's less of a problem if it's like Kentucky, which, I assume, has a lower income tax.                  Well, it assumes it's all in the definition of your market.                 If your market is tax-exempt bonds nationwide, it's one thing; but your brother says the market ought to be people who issue bonds for public works in Kentucky, and Kentucky is the only one who does that so there is no discrimination against anyone else because nobody else is similarly situated to Kentucky with respect to Kentucky public works.                   Well, I thought it was inherent in your argument that most of them -- I mean, if you're talking about hoarding capital, it doesn't work very well if a lot of people outside Kentucky are buying these bonds.               There's not much Balkanization if they're circulated widely.                 I thought that your argument depended on the proposition that most of these bonds are bought by Kentucky residents.                   Well, that's not fair because Kentucky is going to use the proceeds of the bonds to build a hospital, a school that is going to serve Kentucky residents.                   So there's -- it's not just emotional attachment to Kentucky that would promote the purchase of those bonds by Kentucky residents.   It's self-interest.              They want a public hospital nearby, and, therefore, it makes sense to buy the hospital bonds.                   There's a very -- there's a very big difference between -- and it gets to the difference with the Wisconsin cows, which was addressed in United Haulers.             That's a tax on private activity, and private actors don't have the responsibility of providing government services. Kentucky does.                     You don't see a dormant Commerce Clause, though. (Laughter.)

06-694 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Diaz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. DIAZ ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT                   Well, there's a difference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts about -- what, the legality of a particular type of pornography or something like that, and a factual matter?    I thought this was child pornography?                  Saying this regulates thoughts and beliefs, those are two quite different questions, aren't they?                   But that's an entirely different thing to say that this car is a great car and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say what you have is either -- is not -- is child pornography when, in fact, it's not.                      Those are two different things.                      The statute has an objective component.        To the objective observer, it must reasonably cause them to believe that it's actually child pornography.      So that -- that would be -- that would prevent sort of the vague puffery that you're talking about from being covered while still covering something that satisfies both the subjective and objective test.                    No.   I don't think that is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point.                   You wouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment.                     You would be saying we're going to treat this area like other areas, which would say that whoever is challenging it has to show that they're a problematic case. In other words, your client is relying -- he didn't produce Lolita.         You're relying on the effect on other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's protected.   And what I understood the question to suggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied challenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would hear from them, but not in your case.                   Well, but it's the boundary between what is -- what should be protected in relation to what's unprotected. So what's the ratio between legitimate films like Lolita and illegitimate child pornography?                        In other words, is, in fact, the protected material substantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?

Nobody in that process has suggested, well, it's too bad you've already decided this in 32(h)?                    A lot of judges objected to the idea they would adopt the position you're urging here.                    It's not inferring from the failure to act.          It is just a recognition that these things are looked at very carefully by the rules committees and they look at it in a broad way and take in all the information.         We know they're doing that now. And we would be kind of jumping the gun and short circuiting that process.                  How can that be? They're talking about an expert and all that.                He's not going to be hanging around the courthouse.                  Well, that all goes -- that all goes to the harmless error question.               Is that the only time in which notice at the sentencing hearing is going to be adequate?                  But you're really asking them to sentence first and hearing afterward.                  Maybe the whole purpose of the hearing is to find out what factors are pertinent and all that.         You're asking the judge to come to that determination before the hearing.                  So you disagree with the Petitioner on the specificity of notice required?                  Well, if you think you have a particularly good case that they are, again you make that point to the judge.                  If you can see what the last report about these programs was like, you wouldn't think that.     And I think a reasonably competent judge is not going to say, I don't want to see it.               Or maybe he will based on his own experience in dealing with those types of --                  I suppose we'll have --                  I suppose we'll have a lot of appeals about the adequacy of the notice.                You and the Petitioner disagree on that, and appellate courts will have to address that as well.                  Yes.   This may be --                  I'm sorry.    This may be an easy case, but you can imagine others that aren't going to be.                  Continue.    Finish.                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rutledge. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER B.

06-766 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Rossman. Mr. Schwarz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK A.O. SCHWARZ, JR. ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS                  Isn't that a general election case?                  Well, let me ask you about that.                  Let's suppose the State doesn't think that direct voter election of judges is a good idea, that it thinks there ought to be some insulation to avoid the problems of judges campaigning and raising money and all that; yet, at the same time they want some participation by the voters in the process.   Is there any way they can achieve that objective, to have the nominees actually chosen not by the voters but by a convention, and yet have some role by the voters?                   No, I'm just asking is there a way to have a convention with some role by the voters or the party --                   Well, doesn't that seem kind of odd, that if a State can have no role for voters, it can have a pure convention, that they're penalized if they have some role for voters?                   Being found unconstitutional is a pretty severe penalty. (Laughter.)                   But it's all right, I take it, if they don't prevail?                  For example --                   -- the other side says that your argument is -- is implicated whenever a convention leads to a different nominee than the primary.                   You don't think there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that the nominee is going to be someone other than the person who would prevail in the primary election.                      So it's all right to fence them out to that extent?                      I take it, in evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult it is for someone to be elected a delegate.                      Well, is that because Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members at the convention --                     -- for whatever higher office --                     What did he have to do to become on the ballot for delegate?                     500 signatures, right?                     If we don't think that's a sufficient burden, do you lose?                  Do you agree it's not realistic that one way they would address it is by having an entirely appointed system?                  I know they are entitled to it.                  As a practical matter, is that a realistic option in New York?                  Well, I'm sure he has.   I mean that's in his interest. (Laughter.)                    I thought I read a representation somewhere in the briefs that it's unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an entirely appointive system.              So that the options, if you're successful, the options will either be direct election of judges or a pure convention with no role for the voters at all.                  -- supporting it either.

Just the driver, the driver's pulled over, and then somebody comes walking down the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car door, takes the suitcase and starts walking away? Wouldn't the policeman say, put that back, because he thought he had seized not just the driver but everything in the car, too?                   I'm talking about the suitcase.   You wouldn't, you wouldn't reasonably think someone could just take something out of the car that's been stopped by the officer and walk off with it, right?   Everything, all the contents of the car, are seized as well as the driver, right?                   If it's not, if the opposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they stop the car?                    Even if they make that, even if they make that interest clear prior to the stop?                    No.     They pull up next to them and they see that Brendlin is the passenger and they yell over:     Pull over, Brendlin.                   It's not the police who have authority over the passenger; it's the driver. The driver's exercising authority.                   Just because the police say to pull over, the driver can take off and the passenger isn't seized at that point.                   Well, but there's -- you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test for determining when the illegal seizure has been attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test in this case.                    No seizure of a passenger or a driver?                    Finish your sentence.     Sure.

06-84 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shorr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Counsel, even if you're right about the standard, how can you suggest that it's willful here when you have no judicial construction, you have no administrative construction, you have the statutory language that at least the questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly clear?     How can you suggest that the action of the companies on this case even under your standard was willful?                   So if we don't agree with you on that, you would lose on the application of the willfulness standard?                   In other words, your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful violation depends upon your assertion that the statute is perfectly clear?                   You're talking about the Ball letter?                    That wasn't even binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded as authoritative?                   But this is not an antidiscrimination provision.             It doesn't say anyone who discriminates in the setting of race has to send out letters.   It requires an adverse action.                It requires an increase in the charge.                   Don't you have that right independently, though, every year to look at a copy of your credit report?                     When you say you look at the increase with respect to the best credit rate, why is that?      Why wouldn't you look at it relative to say the average insured who walks in the door?                   I don't understand what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?                  Who's GEICO?   I mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law means.   If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I think you could read it this way, does that mean that GEICO reads it that way?

I realize I'm talking about a suit by one of your clients against the other, but would that be a feasible result under the statute?                   You view it as a lost profits claim.       Would your position be different if he directed a sale of the stock and then the stock went down 30 points instead of going up?                       That's not lost profits.   That's avoiding losses to the plan.

JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Well, but trust law doesn't take into account what we have said repeatedly in our ERISA decisions, which is we want to encourage people to set up ERISA plans.              And that has affected the standards that we've adopted, for example, that we even allow a conflict of interest like this to exist. And it seems to me that your position is going to hurt beneficiaries under ERISA plans because people are going to say, as they're perfectly free to do -- people, the employers, are going to say, as they are perfectly free to do, you know, I'm just not going to do it; if we're going to have judges looking at these claims decisions on a de novo basis, who knows how much it'll end up costing me, so I'm not going to set up these plans.                  Do you -- which position do you adopt?         It was only posed as hypothetical, so I don't mean to attribute the position to you; but the Justice Souter hypothetical or the Justice Alito hypothetical?                    Well, that sounds like the Justice Alito hypothetical.                      In other words, the extra scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose. The purpose is to protect against the conflict.                      So if the scrutiny doesn't reveal that the conflict played a role, then it's -- then it's not an abuse of discretion.                     Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT                   We've heard a lot of talk about judicial eyes today, but it doesn't -- it makes it sound as if abuse-of-discretion review is nothing, and with the added factor you want to look more closely.   Courts undertaking abuse-of-discretion review don't do it blindly.       They look at it.                It's just a question of whether they give deference on the judgment calls.   And I'm still not -- I still don't understand how the added factor or, in your case, the added seven factors affects that issue of deference.                  But under trust law --                    -- we don't have -- we don't have an established policy of encouraging people to establish trusts.               We do have reflected in our decisions an established policy of encouraging people to set up ERISA plans.                    Sure.                    Thank you, counsel.
06-937 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Well, but there's nothing to do with these chipsets other than use them in the computers.     I mean, you don't put them on your shelf.   They're not good for anything other than using in the computer.     So saying there's a separate patent for how you use them with the other systems doesn't seem to be very significant.                   Mr. Phillips.                   Mr. Phillips?                   What in the world does clause 3.8 of the license mean?                      It says, "notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its licensed products." In other words, the patent exhaustion doctrine may not apply for all the reasons that we've been talking about, but it applies in the way it would apply if we just sold these licensed products.                That seems to me to give away everything you're talking about.                   That's what the notice says.                   Well, then --                   That argument didn't prevail last year in the KSR case, right?                   I mean, we're -- we've had experience with the Patent Office where it tends to grant patents a lot more liberally than we would enforce under the patent law.                   Mr. Phillips --                   And the way you achieve that result is to condition the sale.                 What you're trying to do is expand what you get under a condition to what you get under a notice.                 And the reason that troubles me is because if you had imposed a condition on the sale, Intel wouldn't have paid you as much for it.   But you say, all right, we'll take the money because -- additional money because there's no condition, but we want to achieve the same result because of the notice.                    Well, they're happy with that because the notice says you can't -- you can only use this with Intel products.                 So they're happy with that solution as well.
06-939 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Hungar. Mr. Gottesman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL GOTTESMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Well, so was anyone who hired a company to do any kind of work, right? Because the Federal policy meant that they couldn't try to restrict what activities the company engaged in with respect to union organizing.                    No, that's not quite accurate.   They moved for summary judgment on the ground that what the State was doing was in effect regulating labor relations --   -- and that that activity was pre-empted.                  No, but the policy -- the policy is they don't want employers to talk about unionization.                      How is that -- how is that different from saying there's a Federal rule, an OSHA requirement you've got to have certain protective devices or whatever, and the State says, well, we want to get the most out of our money, so our money cannot be used to put in these federally required safety devices; you can use somebody else's money for that.             Why isn't that the same thing here?         You're saying there's a Federal labor policy that allows this, and we don't want our money to be spent implementing that policy or pursuant to that policy.                   Why --                    You're saying it doesn't give favoritism to one side or another?                  So that depends, as a practical matter, on the view that there are at least some employers who would be arguing in favor of unionization?                  Yes, but my point is that there are precious few who argue in favor of it.                   What if there is a warranty for another year, say if these tables break you have to replace them?                   I want to get back to your responses on the procedural costs of the case. You said we don't know what the regulatory burden would be with respect to accounting rules.                   Does it make any difference if the argument is which is what I understood it to be, that you can't regulate at all?                  It's not simply that you can't regulate so long as it's particularly burdensome, but you don't have the authority to regulate in this at all.                   That gets to the --                   That gets to the spending clause question.          We're not -- I mean, we can address that without deciding whether the regulations are particularly burdensome.            You were saying well, the accounting is not a big problem.                    But it doesn't mean that it's necessarily spending as opposed to regulation.                    That doesn't seem to me to be responsive to my question.                     Your point was well, we don't know how burdensome a particular regulation is.   If you lose on the question of whether it's spending or regulation, we don't have to wait to see how burdensome it is if we think you're not entitled to regulate at all.                    You're getting back to the spending question.                   I'm putting that aside.                   Regardless of whether -- regardless of whether it's burdensome regulation.                   If it's regulation why isn't that appropriate to deal with on summary judgment.     Not the spending question we have -- that's a different issue.     But if there is no difference with respect to regulation whether it's burdensome or not, so we don't have to have further proceedings on whether it's burdensome.

The party agrees, and agrees to particular provisions, and they submit it to the judge and say:    We want you to write two words, "so ordered," at the bottom of this; and then it becomes a judgment. You don't have to worry about the Arbitration Act.     It's a contract.                   I have the same question for you that I had for your friend:                   Why do you care?     I mean, if you are saying, look, you can enforce this as a state law contract -- you know, it's not streamlined.     The judge doesn't have to do it; but, you know, this judge wants to do it.                 And he is going to enforce it as a State law contract. What do you gain?                      You don't have to go back to State court.        You have diversity.               You are in Federal court, no matter what; right?                   Isn't there --                  Sure.

There was this State hostility to enforcing arbitration agreements at all --                  And so what the Federal Arbitration Act says is, all right, in the narrow circumstances where the parties agreed, subject to this narrow standard, you have to enforce it.                     But that doesn't mean we are going to override the State law across the board.
07-1015 +++$+++                   Mr. Reinert. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER A. REINERT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Well, that's a little bit different -- if I could interrupt you -- than saying, make the conditions of confinement as harsh as possible.    It's saying, make the conditions of confinement such that they will not be able to communicate with alleged -- alleged -- other prisoners that -- that might be part of the same group connected with the activities on 9/11.                   Do you agree that -- to follow up on Justice Breyer's questioning of General Garre, do you believe that the same pleading standards apply in the action against the president of Coca-Cola as apply to the actions of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI on the evening of September 11, 2001?                   I'm sorry? Certainly or certainly not?                  So the pleading standard -- let's leave the president of Coca-Cola out of it.   The local manager of the Coca-Cola distribution center, you can state that the same rigor required in the complaint that applies to him also applies to the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI in the wake of 9/11?                  But your -- your response then focuses solely on the merits of the underlying claim, not any requirement of -- of heightened pleading.                  Well I thought -- and others may know better in connection to Bell Atlantic, but I thought in Bell Atlantic what we said is that there's a standard, but it's an affected by the context in which the allegations are made.                  That was a context of a particular type of antitrust violation and that affected how we would look at the complaint.                  And here, I think you at least accept, don't you -- or I understood from your answers to the question on Coca Cola that maybe you don't -- that because we're looking at litigation involving the Attorney General and the Director of FBI in connection with their national security responsibilities, that there ought to be greater rigor applied to our examination of the complaint.                  Do you -- do you disagree with the notion that Bell Atlantic at least established that the level of pleading required depends on the context of the claim -- the context of the particular case?                  But that's also not the --                  Absurd and bizarre is also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to follow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we supposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely that the president of Coca-Cola would take certain actions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United States?                  I was just going to say the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case through the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice in the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature particularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that the president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a particular price-fixing scheme?              Then does this case seem so terribly different from the level of specificity Bell Atlantic would require?                   But that's easy.   I hope that the Attorney General and the Director of FBI -- of the FBI knew of and approved whatever the policy was.   What you have to show is some facts, or at least what you have to allege are some facts, showing that they knew of a policy that was discriminatory --                   -- based on ethnicity and country of origin.                  I'm sorry -- swept up?   You mean they were in -- in prison because they had violated immigration and other laws, right?                  You can finish.

And in the latter case, you would say that's a sale, and in the former case you would say it's not a sale?                   You don't -- you don't retain ownership of that.                And if you go to the bank and say:     Show me my money, they are not going to say:     Well, here's your money.             They -- they have title to it.

But that's -- that's just a belt-and-suspenders act.               I mean, he -- he has the authority here, and he -- although it may look difficult, he has to envision there may be people who challenge that -- his interpretation of the law.                    So there's the other provision that will make it inapplicable under that as well.                      If I could just pause --                      -- for a moment. The -- the President in exercising this waiver purported to act not only under the statute but under the Constitution as well.                So if we were to accept your argument, we would have to decide whether or not he had the power under the Constitution.                      Well, it's not presented because your friends on the other side think the -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies. But if we agree with you and disagree with that, it seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has the argument that he has this authority under the Constitution.

PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   What if -- we've been talking about the officer approaching somebody on the street who has the bulge in his pocket, what if the person with the bulge in his pocket approaches the officer?     Can the officer at that point, even if he has no suspicion that crime is afoot, conduct a pat down?                   This is -- this is like the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to wait for the defendant to draw first?                   So in response to my --                      One moment.   In response to my hypothetical, even though the officer reasonably thinks he is in a situation where he could be shot, he can't do anything about it, not even a simple pat down, even though he did not initiate the contact, somebody comes up to him?                      No, no, let's just say it's like this case:           The guy's coming up, he's wearing the colors of the Crips gang and he has a bulge in his pocket.     It's not a crime to wear that type of clothing; it may not be a crime to have a bulge in your pocket; but he nonetheless has a reasonable suspicion that he's being -- he's in a threatening situation, even though he has no basis for thinking that a crime is being committed.                   You're giving up a shield here, I take it?       If instead of a pat down, the officer said, where were you last night at 10:00 o'clock, without Miranda warnings, you would say, well that's just -- that's just fine?                   Well, if you look at the first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's position would believe, how does he tell?                  I mean, even if the other officer goes to the window and starts asking the driver, "Can I see your insurance papers," there's no representation that's why we stopped you, that's all we're interested in.               They may have stopped him because they have reason to believe that that car was involved in criminal activity.                  They don't have to disclose immediately what's involved. So how can the passenger know why the officer is stopping the person in the first place? Hypothesize that he has been involved in criminal activity.   He may think, well, they've caught me and they're just going through this charade to try to get information about it and make the people feel comfortable, whatever.        I mean, just because he says, "You don't have insurance papers," that's -- I don't think it's reasonable for the passenger to say, "Oh, this is not about me.     I can get up and leave."                   Well, what else?                   He is supposed to assume that it's not about him because of her tone?                    Your hypothesis about why she -- why he was free to leave is because of the tone of the arresting officer?                  The tone of the --                    And there's no finding about the tone of the officer, right?                   Why isn't the -- why isn't the "seizure" and the "consensual" aspect also mutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each other?    It seems to me it's an awfully difficult decision for the officer to make.                 I stopped this person.    I know under Brendlin that he is seized, and I'm engaged in a dialogue, and I have to worry that at some point he thinks he is free to leave.                   Well, you seem -- your argument assumes a fairly bright line between the point at which the individual is seized and the point at which the interaction becomes a consensual search.                   And I'm just saying that in the running line of cases, that line is going to be very blurry.                   No.   The converse situation is that so long as the interaction continues, it is a seizure, and the officer can take reasonable steps, the pat down to protect, her safety.                   That doesn't have a line-drawing issue.                  Thank you.
07-1125 +++$+++                   Ms. Hodge, we will hear from you on behalf of the Barnstable School Committee. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KAY H. HODGE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   You are not arguing that the agency regulations have the effect of precluding the 1983 action.                   So -- I'm sorry, so you seem to be saying that they were right, that 1983 actions are not always precluded, depending on whether there is a difference in the issues that are presented or whatever. So you should never say that Title IX precludes an action under 1983.               In fact, you should say that sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title IX may result in the fact that you don't have available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there is still a cause of action.                  It's kind of odd to say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are saying that whenever there is issue preclusion, the consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that actions were precluded in Smith.                Well why -- I guess I've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question.                 Why do we have to decide that, and we would just say there is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it, I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are precluded or the issues result in the fact that you don't recover.                   Well, that's because we're still in the business of implying rights of action under Bivens.   And it's different to say -- you know, if you say we are applying it, but as soon as Congress does something, we are not going to do that.                 That's quite different than construing a provision like 1983 which Congress has enacted.

MEADE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIMMONS                   No court is going to accept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here, look at my client as a layperson who didn't know what to do.   That's not going to be adequate, is it?                    What's wrong with Mr. Miller's response that at the very first level of review, you can start all over; and at that point you know precisely why your claim was denied?                    That was my question.   Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than just a stamp saying "denied," right?                     There is some explanation in every case?                   Thank you, Mr. Meade. Mr. Lippman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. LIPPMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT SANDERS                    You started earlier, at one point, to say how this actually worked out in your case.     Could you just spend a minute to explain that?                    How it makes a difference in your case.                    So why wasn't that enough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who had the burden?                   Uh-hmm.                   Well, you would phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have done and what you weren't able to do, and which you can now go back and do if it's remanded.                    You don't have to have the evidence that three people would say he was complaining about the vision loss at the time.                   It just seems a reasonable thing to -- you know, maybe it is reasonable, maybe it's not; but the Veterans Administration has more knowledge about that.                     Thank you, counsel.
07-1216 +++$+++                      Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. Mr. Peck. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     You don't dispute that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is adequate and independent?                  Well, I -- yes, that's exactly right.      And I think the purpose for the rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision for the trial court.      If you have got two errors, and she says the instruction's no good, on appellate review you don't know which basis was at issue.                  There is no doubt here the basis on which the trial court was ruling, is there?                   To move -- to move from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are correct that there is this routine, clear rule of State procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide this complicated, difficult rule of Federal constitutional law instead?                   So you think we just made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by this adequate and independent State ground that the Oregon courts had relied upon?                   But then I think your --                   But I think your answer -- go ahead with your but. (Laughter.)                   Well, I'm sorry.   I still don't see that answer.            You are saying they said yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can still reach -- there might still be a Federal due process issue, so we just can't rely on that.                And if that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession that this is not an adequate and independent State ground that would bar consideration of a Federal constitutional issue.                    I guess I think it's the more routine practice for a court, if you have a -- again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely on that.   Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say, well, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway. But it seems to me, under your presentation, it's the other way around.           It's a clear and easy procedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined constitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.                   There is, of course, another way to protect our constitutional authority in this case.   We are talking about procedures for addressing the substantive due-process challenge to a punitive damages award.           That is the second question presented here. If we went and granted that question and considered that issue, we would have protected our authority to reach that question despite the procedural objections alone.     Why don't we just do that?                     I'm not asking you to argue here today the second question presented.                     But if we have some concern, if there is something malodorous about the fact that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last minute to come up with this rule that was before it all the time, which was a State court rule that you would expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to address what we do in a situation, having to characterize the nature of that -- that consideration, simply by saying:    Look, we are going to go ahead with the questions presented.          We can decide it in this case; and to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and do it.                      I -- I thought -- Mr. Peck, I thought you just told me that there has been full and adequate briefing on that question.

07-1239 +++$+++                    Mr. Kendall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD B. KENDALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Well, with one important qualification.         The question was the balance of those equities on a preliminary basis.                   In other words, before we reach a final decision, we're going to prevent the Navy from engaging in the sonar exercises that they think are necessary.              Not even after we have decided they were wrong, just because we think there is a likelihood that they might be wrong.                   Well, I thought that would have been the whole ball game until I read your brief.   Your brief does not spend a page defending the decision on the merits of the lower courts.                   Nothing about emergency circumstances or CEQ.                   Instead, you raise other arguments on which the district court did not rely in finding likelihood of success.                   So given that, I would have thought we would have a lot more to talk about when it gets to the permanent injunction on the merits.                  Oh, yes, yes.     You certainly raised those issues.               I'm not saying that. What I am saying the district court didn't rely on those in finding likelihood of success.                  Yes.                  That's what the district court relied on.           Where in your brief do I see a defense of the district court's analysis, as opposed to the very coherent argument about Hayburn's case and everything else, issues the district court didn't reach?                   It would have increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals there.                   Well, the increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards.                          But it's 1,000 yards of circle.              And if I remember high school geometry right, that's a squared increase.                  And there are people in airplanes?                  Not just straight ahead.                  I guess my question was, that increases the area exponentially that has to be scrutinized.   And I don't see why, as you said, that was wrong.                   Well, that's very unfair.   There were six conditions imposed by the district court.   The Navy didn't even appeal four of them.   They gave up on four out of the six issues. That's not insisting on having it their way.                   The other ways it struck me how the district court relied on the fact that the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in the past to say well, there can't be any problem with adding more protection.        No good deed goes unpunished.                      They had already taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals. Now you say that wasn't.                      But they were taking some actions.                     Can I -- can I derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of equities question?      As I read the opinions most of the balancing here was done by the Ninth Circuit, not the district court.   I found the district court's balancing in only one sentence.        The court after all of its prior -- the court is also satisfied that the balance of hardships tips in favor -- favor of granting an injunction. " It goes on.            But it's just one sentence. The Ninth Circuit talked about deferring to the district court but in fact it supplied all the balance of the analysis for the balance.                   Suppose it's still fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its attention on likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the equities.                  I think that's -- I think that's quite right. My question, though, is that at no point that did the district judge undertake a balancing of the equities, putting on the one side the potential for harm to marine mammals that she found -- and that's your point about the record -- and putting on the other side the potential that a North Korean diesel electric submarine will get within range of Pearl Harbor undetected.    Now, I think that's a pretty clear balance. And the district court never entered -- never went into that analysis.                    Even the district -- even the district court recognized, in the words of her opinion, that it would propose "a substantial challenge" -- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime that she imposed in the injunction.                   Mr. Kendall, you wanted to respond to some comments by the Solicitor General.    I wanted to make sure that you've had an opportunity to do that.         I -- you were derailed by questioning, but I know you responded to some.                      Are you --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    So then you'd have an easy time before the jury.                And same thing with respect to the individual.             All that's saying is that when you are dealing with one person, it's pretty easy to prove that he, you know, directs himself or, you know, has an ongoing plan, but that doesn't mean that it's not a separate element that the jury should have to find.                  Well, you say that it's not distinct from the underlying offenses.                  But they don't have to be separately instructed that they have to find that, do they?                  What is the instruction that the Seventh Circuit and the Eighth Circuit give that you don't think is necessary?                  I thought an individual -- I thought an individual could be the enterprise?                  An independent contractor rather than an employee.                   In fact, your friend said that the period the jury found was just a couple of months.                   Not at all; not at all.   That would make a lot of sense, because RICO is not intended just to bring in the crimes.                   They are look for something else.       They are looking for an organization that is involved in these types of things.                     You say enterprise. I mean, the objection is that the enterprise is no different than the various predicate acts.

SEVILLA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                      And you reject it as well, I take it --                     Well I -- I don't under -- I didn't follow that answer.                     You're saying if he does have nothing to lose, it is objectively unreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?                      So we have to look at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess, and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in light of Strickland filtered through Yarborough?                   Counsel, talking about -- in Strickland -- right here.                    In Strickland, we said that if a decision by counsel is made upon, quote, "thorough investigation," it is, quote, "virtually unchallengeable."    Now, which of these facts in the Petitioner's brief is wrong:             That Wager retained eight expert doctors to evaluate Mirzayance's mental health; he retained jury consultants; he conducted a mock trial in which he presented mental health defenses to two juries; he hired a private investigator to interview friends and associates; he consulted with Mirzayance's parents and their attorneys; he discussed the case with a retained expert doctor after decision and his co-counsel? Now, that sounds like pretty thorough investigation of the defense you say he should have raised.                   So all the points that your friend began with, which shows his conscious deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that under California law doesn't enter into a consideration of insanity?                   I understand that, but counsel here at the time retained eight expert doctors to evaluate his mental health.                    He conducted the mock jury trial.     He interviewed the parents.                  He hired an investigator to interview friends.                     What you're saying is, well, here's -- if he had hired a ninth expert, he might have come out differently.                     That sounds like a thorough investigation under Strickland.                     So isn't that -- aren't you back to the "nothing to lose" argument?                      He conducted this investigation, which under Strickland we said makes the decision virtually unchallengeable, and you're saying, well, he has an obligation to proffer it.                   So he's got nothing to lose?                   I guess that gets me back to what -- what I thought the case was postured in, which is whether or not a case from this Court clearly establishes when you have nothing to lose, you've got to go ahead and present the defense, or it's a violation of Strickland.    And what case is that?                   Well, I -- I understood your responses to the various questions here to, in effect, be arguing for that standard.                      You are saying, look, he was going to get the same sentence anyway.    You know, all -- all your answers sound to me like nothing to lose.                   He made a determination -- he made a determination after a thorough investigation of the various points I went through with you earlier that it was not a credible defense.   Now, maybe that was reasonable or unreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under Strickland we said it is virtually unchallengeable, and it doesn't seem to me to be objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law from this Court.                  Thank you, counsel.
07-1356 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Edge. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. EDGE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Counsel, do I understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting the introduction of these statements for impeachment? The sentence says, "A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule that allowed use of uncounseled statements for impeachment would not deter violations of the right to counsel."                      You agree with the representations on -- from your friends on the other side that there is no case of ours where we have excluded a statement of evidence submitted for impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in this case in chief?       If you prevail here, it would be the first time that any evidence or statement has been excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?                   Counsel, you've -- you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would be excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment purposes is that this is a trial right.                But the Sixth Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right to the assistance of counsel.            Well, he had assistance of counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's evidence and all the bad things that he did. But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth Amendment violation where we allow the evidence to be admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you know, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength of that distinction.                    Well, it seems to me you are getting away from the basis for your distinction, then.      Saying well, it's not just at trial. Well, these other constitutional rights where we have allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right, outside of trial.                    Just to pause on that, it affects his decision to testify because it makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if he is going to testify.                   The focus -- the focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword because the harm that we are facilitating under your rule is to allow perjured testimony.                   Yeah, and if he has the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out. He was -- he was he is not lying now.                   The reason he said something different then was, you know, he likes to brag in prison or whatever the basis is.                     I think -- I think that's quite right.      But I don't see how excluding the evidence even on impeachment helps that.                  I mean, they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will get some leads from it even if they can't use it.                    But excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't eliminate that harm.
07-1372 +++$+++                     Mr. Shanmugam? ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   So, they relied on federal law to create the fiduciary obligation.                     So if we think that federal law did not create the fiduciary obligation, what should we do?                   All Federal law? All Federal law?    In other words, not simply the Apology Resolution but the other Federal provisions?                   Do you think those -- yes.                  You would object to that?                    What about the Newlands Resolution and Admission Act and the Organic Law, do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on those, that also would be inappropriate?                    They relied on them the same way you say they relied on the Apology Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary responsibility under State law.                   So you would have no -- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you would have no objection to an opinion that said no source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further proceedings on remand should be based solely on State law?                   It's not simply a question of the source of the fiduciary duty.                It, presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything else.                   But if we told them that these various Federal resolutions, including the Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a particular way that precluded the burdening of the State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they would have to find a basis under State law that was not inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect title.                   But then it would also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to say that it did not create this obligation and the Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it precluded the creation under State law of this type of obligation.                   And if the Hawaiian Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the status of the land prior to admission, then it has to run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be consistent with the Federal provisions.                   No, I'm not saying they did.     That's the first question.                  I'm not saying they grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would have to determine whether Federal law precluded the grounding of the fiduciary duty under the status of the land prior to admission.                   So the decision of the Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated.                   Under Munnsingwear.

Where is the specific reference to mineral leases, mineral resources?                    It says "resources." I don't remember it saying "mineral resources."                    That's a big difference, don't you think?                      But you knew all of that -- that's not -- that's not something you discovered on remand.        You knew all that before.                      And that affidavit was before or after our decision the first time around?                  Even if you are right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a little about the money-mandating aspect, the second stage of the analysis under Navajo I.                  Before we find a waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of the United States, we usually insist on something a little more specific than general trust principles.                  Well, that's not how the Secretary reads 635.         Isn't he entitled to Chevron deference?
07-1428 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Meade. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Can I ask you --                  Can I ask you to touch on the distinction between racial discrimination and race-conscious action?            The actions that were taken in many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents Involved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions; there was a reason that the governments in those cases were taking the action.         It was because of what they saw as the impact on race.        Yet we concluded that was racial discrimination.    So what's the -- how do you draw the line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial discrimination that's not?                     Well, but if we -- if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it seems to me in your argument, that the actions that they've taken here are not intentional racial discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you don't have much to worry about.                 But let's assume that they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and Adarand and Parents Involved.                     And the only reason you say that isn't by an individual is that you have blacked out the names?                     So your position is what?   They threw out the test, so you would have no problem at all if they looked at those results and they were predominantly black rather than white; you would say the city can throw out the test and there's no racial discrimination there at all?                      So this case would come out differently, if the list was there with then names and they go down and instead of saying throw out the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because you're white.   And they go down the list and throw out everybody who took the test; then that would be all right?                     So they can keep -- they get do-overs until it comes out right?                   Or throw out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little better, but not so -- throw that one out?                     Well if -- how many times before it's a problem?                     You say if they did it over and over again.          What if they did it twice here?                    Is that -- I am sorry.   Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict scrutiny does apply under the Constitution?                      Compliance with a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling interest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause?                    I guess it would go to how you construe the statute.                It seems to me an odd argument to say that you can violate the Constitution because you have to comply with the statute.                      Can I get back just -- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the distinction between intentional racial discrimination and race conscious action.             I thought both the plurality and the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the fact that race conscious action such as school siting or drawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating in particular assignments is not. Now, why is this not intentional discrimination?     I understood you to say it was because you don't have particular individuals being treated on the basis of their race.           You are going to have to explain that to me again, because there are particular individuals here.     They are the plaintiffs, and they say they didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial action by the -- the city.             Why is that not on the racial -- intentionally racial discrimination side rather than the permissible race consciousness side?                  Well, that -- you may be right that that's what the question is about.                    I still don't have in my mind from you a line about how we decide.   Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand, Wygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken obviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination. So -- and then there are cases where we have recognized that race conscious action is permissible.                  Again, what -- when I look at something like this, how I do decide which side of the line that's on -- this is on?                  But just to take Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving factor was not a specific decision with respect to specific individuals.        They didn't care whether it was Jones or Smith that they were citing.                       All they cared about was the race.       And it seems the -- the same here. You maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is not getting the promotion.             All you care about is who is getting the promotion.         All you care about is his race.                    You just referred --                    I'm sorry.   You just referred to a discriminatory test.                 What you said in the district court, and I quote, the issue is not whether the tests were valid. Are you just changing positions on that?                   Justice Kennedy.                    What type of -- what type of other things are you talking about there?                    Well, the question, I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not under the traditional approaches you take under Title VII.                    So does your position here depend on a conclusion that this test is invalid?                   So your response to me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid, your argument is you just have to show that there's a basis for being worried that it might be invalid.                  And then it seems to me the only distinction is how high a showing you require.       And you reject the idea that you have to show a strong basis in the evidence?                   I understand from -- I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not from your argument that --                   You agree with the strong basis in fact standard?                   So I guess, my -- so my -- your position is that you should never have a strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?                   So your position is that the city -- the -- the government can take action without -- only if it's reasonable.                       It's a reasonable view of whether or not they might or might not be liable.   That's the standard.              And then they can engage in race-based action?                   Well, what is something less than that, that they might be sued?                   Isn't that -- isn't that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they need is a reasonable basis to think that further investigation might be useful?                   No, I'm sorry -- that's an answer about why it would be okay.                       I'm just saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?                   But --                   I'm sorry --                   I still -- I still don't have absolutely yes -- of what?                     Yes, they can --                     Well, just to get back to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd have to certify it.       You say that, in that situation, the decisionmaker could not have a reasonable basis for thinking further investigation is required.                   Why?   Just because the second test came out the same way?                   It's not at all reasonable to think they ought to look at it further?                   Thank you, counsel.

Okay, but that seems to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event -- let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't dumping chemicals with it.          You don't then say "there is no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once the finding is made that the facts didn't support it, then there was no jurisdiction."               You say, "there was jurisdiction all the time and you lose."

I thought your position was once there's a request, there's a request, and that's enough.                   So I -- I suppose what the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any situation there's going to be factual issues about what's a request or not.         I mean, he could say, the court says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says, "Johnson?   Is that the best you can do?"                    And the question is, is that accepting Johnson or not?                     He says is that the best you can do?            Maybe it is, maybe it's not.   I mean, but the point is whether or not you establish a rule that requires some request, and in the odd case there will be a debate about what's a request or not, but the issue is the general rule.

STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    On the question of apportionment, is it really your position that because of the precision you would require, that if there's a big fight over whether it's 10 percent responsibility or 30 percent and there's no way to tell, that if the parties said, look, we'll take 40 percent, that that's no good?                    Isn't that what happened here?   I mean, whatever -- I guess the railroads said 6 percent, and the district court said, well, just to be on the safe side, we'll give them 9 percent.                   But that still doesn't address the question, if you have varying degrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or causal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to apportion the liability.                    Well, what -- what about Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that question of her?                    She also said that the Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no cases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that comment.                   So you don't think that the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you have a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible and the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?                   And what do we have in the way of findings on that question?                   But is that right? I mean doesn't it -- aren't you challenging the whole basis for apportionment?         I mean there is -- I don't think when you're apportioning responsibility, you allocate whether or not the actors independently caused the harm.   I thought the assumption was, yes, everybody's -- all of this group has contributed to the harm, but now we're going to apportion their responsibility.                    Thank you, counsel.

07-208 +++$+++                   Mr. Stancil. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Do you argue that the State has no interest to be considered in this calculus?    In other words, it is solely the interest of the defendant in representing himself and that the State has no interest in ensuring a credible process?                  Well, but an individual doesn't have to know and appreciate the rules of courtroom procedure to be judged competent to stand trial.                  Well, but that's suggesting to me that you give no weight to the State interest.   In other words, so long as he's held to those rules, that's basing your determination solely on his interest and no weight given to the State's interest in ensuring that you have a trial where people are observing the rules.                     Can I ask the -- it's really the flip side of the question Justice Scalia asked.        Why shouldn't we be concerned that if you have the same standard that trial courts are going to elevate the competency showing beyond what really is required? In other words, if they have to have the same standard, they don't want a proceeding where you've got someone who -- you know, whatever the standard is -- is not going to be as competent or reasonably represented as he would by a lawyer, so they're more likely to find the person incompetent to stand trial in the first place? These are addressed to two different, entirely different questions.               And rather than having a problem with merging the standards which results in one of them being cheated, why don't we have two different standards?                    Yes.                    Well then, why don't they have the choice of elevating the standard for ability to represent themselves in a coherent way at trial?                   That's what understood Godinez to say, that you certainly don't have to elevate your standard, but I didn't understand it to say you can't.                   Well, it actually doesn't say that.                  It seems to me that both sides are kind of raising these, taking the arguments to extremes and they don't have to do that. If you -- if you accept the fact that there can be a higher standard than competency to stand trial, that doesn't mean that the judge can say you can't make the decision if you have tattoos.                  Well, but you're putting a heavy burden on the State to say, all right, now -- and the prosecution -- to say, now we've got to look out for what this guy is going to say, and now we've got to appoint standby counsel.                  And I'm not sure I was how your response deals with the guy who says: I mean, is indicted for 93 counts because it's 1993. the prosecutor supposed to stand up then and say: Objection, that's ridiculous? Well, one, certainly the                  Yes, that the State has to incur these extra burdens?                  Finish your thought.                  Thank you, Mr. Stancil.

STEWART, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                    Mr. Stewart, I don't understand that point.       Let's say Allison Engine is defrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of people, boats, whatever they make.                 Allison Engine is defrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this way and, in fact, they don't. It doesn't know Bath is going to use some of them in a government ship as opposed to a private ship. So you're saying in that context, since there's no intent to defraud the government, there's no liability?                    It just sells them engines.    It doesn't know what Bath is going to do with them.    They are going to put some in private boats and some in the government boats.                    Well, how far down the line?    I mean, let's take that hypothetical.                     The government gives money to the State to build a school. The school has to be painted as part of that, so the school contractor, the prime contractor, takes some of the money from the Federal Government and pays the painter.    The painter needs to buy paint.                   So the painter takes some of the Federal money and pays the paint company.     The paint company has to get the chemicals from somebody.           So the paint company takes some of the money and pays the chemical company.                       And at that point, the chemical companies fraudulently added, you know, a dollar on to the cost of the chemicals.                      So that dollar goes all the way through.                     So the Government ends up paying a dollar more because of the fraud five, six, seven times down the line. Can an uninterested person bring a qui tam action against the chemical manufacturer because of that fraud?                  It's not a presentment requirement.          That's in (a)(1.          It's that the claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the government.    And what you're saying is when the government pays the State, that pays the school, that pays the contractor, that pays the paint -- blah, blah, blah -- that that is payment by the government of a false claim because the chemical manufacturer six or seven steps down the line commits fraud.                     Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Helmer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. HELMER, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                     So your argument -- your understanding of the scope of the statute is exactly the same if the words "by the government" were replaced by "with Federal funds"?                 You think those are -- you think the statute is exactly the same if it said "with Federal funds" instead of "by the government"?                     So when the government -- when the phrase "by the government" was added -- was it in '86?                     There were a lot of statutes that said "with Federal funds," right?                   So why did the Congress add the phrase "by the government" instead of "with Federal funds" if it meant the same thing?                   Right.   So I guess I get back -- you read "by the government" as if it said "with Federal funds"?                  So if in fact, as you suggest, Allison submitted the certificate to the Navy person at the shipyard, then the question presented in this case is not in fact presented here?                  Because the question presented assumes that there had not been a submission to the Federal Government of the false -- false claim.                  Thank you, Mr. Helmer.

Mr. Fisher, you -- your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious liability for punitive damages.

Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where the court found that the owner is not vicariously liable.                    What is your position of how to look at the case if you have a managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate policy?    Is the corporation still exposed to punitive damages?                   In a case like this.                   So what can a corporation do to protect itself against punitive damages awards such as this?                   Well, and assume it has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?                   And you're saying -- that's the question I'm asking.

I mean it has to say that the policy is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the individual is liable for punitive and other awards. But what more can the corporation do other than say here is our policies?               And try to implement them.                   At that level -- at that level, the president, I think you would have an argument that the policy was being changed.                  It's not clear that that argument works when you're dealing with someone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.                   I suppose that would go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is enforced.     If the president of the company isn't following the policy it's not going to be taken very seriously.     That's different than saying you have a situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm company policy is breached, the individual is breaching the policy.                   A while ago you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.                   A little while ago, you were about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability Act.                   But I was -- I would have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third point.     In other words, if we're looking to guidance, you look to Federal law.        And whether it's directly applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy. And why isn't that something we should look to, at least under question three?                   Well, that means they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection that the limitation of liability gives.                   It doesn't mean that we should ignore the reflection of that policy outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.                     The argument is not that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply.                   It's that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one area, that we as a matter of development of Federal common law, Federal maritime law should allow dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area of shipowning liability.                     It was a different jury.   And the jury is the one that set the amount of punitive damages.                     Right.                   This is the same judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to Exxon, right?                   So he was operating that under understanding of the law.
07-290 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE                  Well, these various phrases under the different standards that are proposed, "compelling interest," "significant interest," "narrowly tailored," none of them appear in the Constitution; and I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an all-encompassing standard.          Isn't it enough to determine the scope of the existing right that the amendment refers to, look at the various regulations that were available at the time, including you can't take the gun to the marketplace and all that, and determine how these -- how this restriction and the scope of this right looks in relation to those? I'm not sure why we have to articulate some very intricate standard.         I mean, these standards that apply in the First Amendment just kind of developed over the years as sort of baggage that the First Amendment picked up.   But I don't know why when we are starting afresh, we would try to articulate a whole standard that would apply in every case?                  But this law didn't involve a restriction on machine guns.                    It involved an absolute ban.    It involved an absolute carry prohibition.    Why would you think that the opinion striking down an absolute ban would also apply to a narrow one -- narrower one directed solely to machine guns?                     Thank you, General.                     Mr. Gura. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    So a conscientious objector who likes to hunt deer for food, you would say, has no rights under the Second Amendment.                     He is not going to be part of the militia.                 He is not going to be part of the common defense, but he still wants to bear arms.   You would say that he doesn't have any rights under this amendment?                  Is there any parallel --                   Is there any parallel at the time that the amendment was adopted to the machine gun?   In other words, I understand your point to be that, although that's useful in modern military service, it's not something civilians possess. Was there anything like that at the time of the adoption, or were the civilian arms exactly the same as the ones you'd use in the military?                   Why isn't the trigger-lock provisions that are at issue here, why aren't they similar to the various provisions that Justice Breyer mentioned like the gunpowder restriction? In other words, for reasons of domestic safety, they said you can't store the gunpowder anywhere but on the top floor.   Why isn't the modern trigger-lock provision similar to those?                   Well, there is always a risk that the children will get up and grab the firearm and use it for some purpose other than what the Second Amendment was designed to protect.                  Well, right.   But, I mean, you don't necessarily expect a young child to be able to reassemble the pistol.                     What about -- what about age limits -- you've got to be over 18 or you've got to be over 21 to get a license?                     Is the age limit necessarily the same nationwide?                 Maybe 16 in Wyoming makes more sense but 21 in the District.                  -- you would define "reasonable" in light of the restrictions that existed at the time the amendment was adopted.                  You know, you can't take it into the marketplace was one restriction.                 So that would be -- we are talking about lineal descendents of the arms but presumably there are lineal descendents of the restrictions as well.

MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   So why do you -- I take it, though, that you concede the six-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act, right?                   I mean, your brief says this is an unbending and unqualified prohibition on the use of exports except up to -- if it's before six years and one day.                   You are taking an adamant position with respect to three years but you give up six years.                      So -- so, the rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally based prohibition is not pertinent?                      You're saying if the statute was clear and it said three years, that would be fine, even though it's a claim under the Export Clause?                   Plus you get interest.                   You give all of this up when it comes to the statute of limitations.                       I mean, the government's argument could be just as implausible as you suggested it is here.              But if it involves a claim six years and one day out, it's just too bad.                       It doesn't matter that it's a constitutional claim.                       It doesn't matter how erroneous the government's position was, because the government can impose limitations like that even on the assertion of constitutional claims. That's all they are doing here.                     We say just as unanimously a couple of things last year on -- term as well in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's decision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had Hinck's term of trust on the books.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    Is it often the case -- and I don't know, but is it often the case that the people who are engaged in one these asset purchases are, in fact, the creditors themselves?                   In other words, they are owed a lot of money and said, well, let's -- basically, let's take over the business and run it ourselves?                   Well, I assume that the creditors have an interest in that as well.                 I don't know how -- I mean, they are the ones who could move quickly to get the confirmation of the plan, because they are the ones whose interests have to be addressed before the plan can be confirmed. So wouldn't they have an interest in the melting bananas, or whatever? (Laughter.)                  I understand your arguments about the desirability.                  How do you squeeze it into the statutory language?                  Under a plan and you're suggesting that it's under the plan before there is a plan.                   Your argument there is that "under a plan confirmed" means something different than "under a confirmed plan"?                  Do you -- do you agree with the proposition that you only go back so far as the filing of the petition?             Well, what in your argument suggests that that's a logical stopping point? It seems to me that if you don't take the date of confirmation, I don't know why all of your policy arguments wouldn't cause you to go back further.                  Yes, but we've already shown a willingness to abandon that type of limitation with "under a plan confirmed."                    So, you know, the consideration of the prior transfer is going to take place in the context of a bankruptcy case.                    How do you know whether to pay the tax or not?               I mean, you know that the bankruptcy petition has been filed, but you really don't know whether there's going to be a plan confirmed under Chapter 11.    How do you know whether to pay or not?                    I assume there are penalties if you don't pay on time.                  But this doesn't happen for some time down the road, right?                  Up to, I guess -- we were told up to 400 days.
07-320 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Herman. General Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE                   General, we haven't talked yet about the disclosure, the special disclosure requirements in that money is speech, and in a First Amendment area it strikes me as very problematic that the government requires you to disclose in a differential way how you intend -- when you're spending a particular amount of money and on such precise day-by-day requirements. I mean, is there any other area -- if you're writing a book, you don't have to disclose to the government when you're going to publish it and how far along you're getting in the draft.                And yet, it just seems this is the same sort of thing in the election context.                  But those are applicable across the board.           These are special disclosure requirements for people who are going to engage in additional speech.                    So wouldn't you think they would require more detailed and more expeditious disclosure of the associational link than of the self-funding?    And yet it's the exact opposite?                     What if the -- what if the restriction were more tailored, if Congress decided the one area where the wealthy really have an advantage is buying television time, so that's what we're going to restrict.           If the wealthy individual buys a certain amount of television time, we're going to allow contributions to the less wealthy candidate to buy television time.   They think the money is not as big a deal in the other areas.           Would that be all right?                  So what if Congress decided that a debate on a particular issue was distorted by the wealth of owners of newspapers?                 And so it passed a law saying that people who are responding to that are relieved of the tax burden they would otherwise have to pay, on whatever their -- you know, sales tax on pamphlets that they want to sell.               Would that be all right?                  To level the playing field on the debate on that particular issue?                  No -- so you can tax -- you can tax a newspaper, but you cannot -- you don't have to tax people who are responding to the newspaper?                  The taxing power is an -- is a limit on the exercise of First Amendment rights?                  But that's any -- any organization that engaged in lobbying.                  So is there no limitation on the rationale of leveling the playing field throughout the First Amendment?                  Well, it's trying -- it's certainly trying to chill self-financing by burdening it when it reaches a certain level.                  What if the law expressed a displeasure at the introduction of self-financing and said that, as you have these very rapid disclosures, that the less wealthy candidate can accept contributions whatever, twice the amount of whatever the self-financed candidate is spending on his campaign?    Is that all right?                  Well, he -- you know, the millionaire, as we are talking about, spends -- discloses that he has spent $500,000.                  Then the contribution limits are off the table for the less wealthy candidate to the tune of a million dollars, in other words twice as much as the self-financed candidate.                  Well, why not? Because as -- your point in this case, rather than the hypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not burdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has benefited.   And it seems to me that would be true in the case of my hypothetical as well.                  I would have thought all the arguments that you gave before, like the self-financed candidate wants to be able to say he doesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would still be equally applicable.                  So it's not a -- it's not a qualitative argument you're making but a quantitative.   At some point, the benefit to the opponent gets to be too much of a chill on the self-financed candidate, but under this system you think it's below the line.

How would you know whether it's an abuse of discretion or not?                 I mean, the issue is going to be the same in every case.                 There was no cross-appeal.   If there had been, we would have increased the sentence, and one court of appeals says, well, we're not going to do it; and the other court of appeals says, yes, we're going to do it.

You have special interrogatories, including number 6 but also number 4 and then they have damages.                  And it's not clear whether those damages are based on the finding of liability under 4 or 6.                  Who wrote that?   You gave us the benefit of the author of the Ninth Circuit, but not the First.                     And, presumably, tribal -- whatever tribal precedent there may be, as well.                     Well, neither could -- and neither could anybody, right?                      I mean if anybody It's because it's not could find it, you could. published anywhere, right? Well, there are published                  One of the points you mentioned earlier is that this is an Indian corporation, and that's a concept I don't understand. If Justices Scalia and Alito form a corporation, is that an Italian corporation? (Laughter.)                  I understand the concept of a minority-owned or an Indian-owned corporation, but the point here is you are trying to say that the corporation is a member of the tribe.                    And I just don't know.     And I certainly don't think the State, when it incorporated this entity, said:                    You're a different type of corporation than every other; you're an Indian corporation.                  How would a normal -- I guess a non-Indian or non-Italian or non-Irish -- corporation dealing with the Long Family Land and Cattle Company know that it was an Indian corporation --                  -- putting apart the particulars in this case?                  Well, I know the BIA says that.    But if you're a bank and somebody comes in and says:    I'm a corporation; I would like a loan, is the bank supposed to start asking questions about whether there are Indian shareholders, and how many, and all of that?                  So they should have a check box on their loan application that says:                  Are you an Indian?                  I'm asking you about:   In a general case, let's say they don't require BIA loan guarantees.        They require, just as in this case, collateral.                  Well, I am sure the facts here matter.      I have a hypothetical question.                 A bank dealing with an Indian-owned corporation, how are they supposed to find out, or may they find out, whether it's an Indian-owned corporation, particularly when under your approach, when they do form that contract, they are subjecting themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction?                  And do they subject themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction because they are dealing with, as you call it, an Indian corporation?                     So that if the bank had two -- two different types of loans, in one situation the corporation comes to the bank.                   It is an Indian corporation, if there is such a thing; and the bank deals with it, although it doesn't know that.                     In the other situation are the facts, as you suggest here; and the -- dealing through the normal, collateral consequences and operations of a contract with a bank, they want to know the collateral, and all of that, that constitutes consent, but a commercial relationship with a member does not.                  It's an odd sort of basis on which to predicate jurisdiction.                 We usually -- when you're dealing with jurisdiction, we usually look for a bright-line rule.                  You said earlier -- I am sorry.   You said earlier that this was a straightforward application of Montana?                  Yes, given the facts.    But isn't it true that this would be the first case in which we have asserted or allowed Indian tribal jurisdiction to be asserted over a nonmember?                  What about -- what about their point that, under our system, governing is based on the consent of the governed, and in this case the bank has no role to play in the nature or establishment of the court to which they are being subjected?                  Well, what if the tribal law has certain cultural principles such as fairness and equity of a sort that aren't recognized under Federal or State law in this type of contractual relationship?   Does that preclude the State court from giving comity or not?                     Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                  Well, you agree with your friend Mr. Frederick that Montana did not address jurisdiction over a nonmember and that this would be the first case in which we'd recognize such jurisdiction?                  What happens if the bank deals with a corporation that is not an Indian corporation, and then that --               the shareholders of that corporation sell their shares to Indians?                  Does the bank now have a consensual relationship with an Indian corporation?                  Well, but the only reason -- the only reason the bank is on the reservation is because the land was collateral, right?                  They didn't want to buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left with a land on a reservation.            Is that consensual?                  So if it's a different -- the Indian -- the corporation is owned by members on the reservation, the collateral they put up is off the reservation, is there consensual dealings with the corporation then?                  Yes, but the subject of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by Indians on the reservation.            The collateral put up is other land that the corporation owns or the individuals own off the reservation.        Jurisdiction or not.                   I guess, what I meant, what do you mean by the subject of the contract?                  What about a home equity loan for home on the reservation.                  Yes.                  Whatever home equity loans are for.                  Well, they are going to add -- add a new wing onto the -- new room on to their home.                  So if Chase Manhattan gets a home equity loan application from somebody and they grant the home equity loan, they are now subject to being sued in tribal court?                  What if the tribal court has a rule that forum selection provisions are not enforceable?                     Does the judgment here that the bank discriminated against the Indian corporation because they didn't give them as favorable terms as they gave someone who hadn't defaulted on a loan impede dealings with Indian corporations by outside members -- outside nonmembers?                     What was the basis for the finding of discrimination?                     It had nothing to do -- the bank's justification had nothing to do with the fact that the entity had defaulted earlier?

COLEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  But it would be a violation of some liberty interest beside the Sixth Amendment.                  I mean, the answer -- your answer is that the Sixth Amendment is concerned with the fair trial, not the detention of individuals, and he has other constitutional rights that would be implicated, but his right to a fair trial is not one of them.                   Well, couldn't he point out -- I mean, if this is a probable cause determination and he knows a particular fact, couldn't he say, well, Magistrate, you should know this, and the magistrate would say, well, I didn't know that, so there's no probable cause?

HILLIER, II ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Well, but just - just as "during" has more than temporal -- can have more than temporal significance, I think "in" can have temporal significance.                  We write "in the holiday season."                  I assume -- I haven't looked at the dictionary -- but "during's" first relationship -- first definition, I suspect, is temporal.                  Your friend indicated that this issue doesn't come up very often as a practical matter.     Do you disagree with that?
07-463 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Kenna. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATT KENNA, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  The Ninth Circuit relied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?                   Counsel, to read just one sentence to you from the National Wildlife Federation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle you face.    It's on page 15 of the government's brief. It says:     "A regulation is not ordinarily consider the type of agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions and it's factual components flushed out by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation." It seems like a high hurdle for you to surmount.                   That's the Abbott Labs exception, isn't it?            I don't think anybody suggests that that is applicable here.                   But that's when his primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?                   You know, the drug companies have to do something.              Well, they don't -- you know, they have to do it before they can                 -- they don't have to wait until they are sent to jail to say that their conduct has been affected.                   But you have not pointed to a particular fact under any of these affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs. In what the National Wildlife Federation case said, "Some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation. "                   You haven't shown any standing with respect to the Burnt Ridge Project on an ongoing basis because that has been settled.                 It's outweighed -- it's out the door.                   So it's in for a penny, in for a pound.       If you show standing with respect to discreet action D, you can challenge A, B, and C?                  Counsel, I now have footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular measure that applies across the board to all individual classifications.    It goes on to say, which is final, "and has become ripe for review in the manner we discussed in the text." Then we say, or Justice Scalia says, "it can of course be challenged under the APA by a person adversely affected.           And although that may have the effect when they get a general decision invalidating a program, it says that a quite different from permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the program as though that itself constituted a final agency action." So you still have to become ripe for review in the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I read to you earlier, and the challenge can only be brought by a person adversely affected.                   I don't see how footnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at all.                    Well, it says -- it says, if it's become ripe for review in the manner discussed in text.      In other words, if it has been applied to a particular individual adversely affected then, quote, "a person adversely affected may bring a challenge. " And I don't -- that seems to me to be a restatement of the sentence I read you earlier.                    That would be like in footnote 2, the general program.                     Yes, they are saying these types of activities we don't do the notice and comment and appeal.        That's the general program. But you have to wait until it's applied to a particular individual who is adversely affected.                   You cut down a tree in the national forest without approval? (Laughter.)                   Oh. (Laughter.)                   And where is "there"?   He would like to go back where?                  This isn't one of those after-submitted declarations, is it?                  Well, don't we generally not look at after-submitted declarations in determining standing?                  So if you -- if yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at that?                  The later filed, where along the district court proceedings were they filed?                  So if you lose that again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get some more declarations.        The reason we don't look at after-submitted declarations is because there has to be under the normal rule, an end to litigation at a particular time.   It seems to me this would be an endless process.   You know, every time the district court identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay, here's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's another basis, well, here's another declaration.                 I'm not sure that that's what our cases sanction.                  You filed them after judgment, right?                   Thank you, counsel.
07-474 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Katyal. Ms. Metcalf. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET A. METCALF ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    No, but, as your friend points out, the constitutional provision says "any person."    It doesn't say any person who is a member of a particular class or any person who is exercising a fundamental right.       It's "any person."                  Well, isn't that an odd system?   I mean, you have -- like our time card example, you're going to have litigation over whether she was late for work or was not late for work, and in fact that's got nothing to do with the reasons she was fired at all.   And yet the government puts it out, well, this is a conceivable reason, and then the other side says, no, it's not, and they fight.                      It just seems so otherworldly; it has nothing to do with the reason at all.                  Well, but that's with respect to legislative or regulatory action, where there are important reasons not to inquire into the motives of the legislators.            It's not clear to me that that same rationale applies here.                   What exactly is the analytic basis of that?        I mean, do you think that -- you don't think the Equal Protection Clause applies at all to this situation where it's just a class of one? Or do you think that the clause is always -- the claim of violation under the clause is always rebutted automatically?   What is the --                    Oh, but that's very different, because those cases say that those individuals have no First Amendment rights.                 In other words, in the public employee context, talking about their official obligations, there is no First Amendment right to do that.    I think it's quite a different situation to say there is no equal protection right in government employment.                Thank you, Ms. Metcalf. Ms. Blatt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                    Well, I agree with all of that, but -- so the Equal Protection Clause doesn't apply?                    So you think the Equal Protection Clause applies --                     -- in any case of public employment -- what -- that's satisfied?                     But the Equal Protection Clause doesn't balk about classes.                   It talks about any person.
07-499 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Pincus. Mr. Katsas. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    Where you stopped -- you stopped in the part that interests me, "participated in persecution on account of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular group.                     When these people are forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of the victim's race or religion; it's because someone's got a gun at their head. So, you ask them, "Well, why did you do that?   Why did you, you know, whip that person?                    They will say:   Because they were going to kill me.                    They are not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased against his race or religion.                  Well, how do you know that?    Why can't it just as easily modify "incited," "participated in"?              You have persecution. Did they participate in the persecution on account of race; or did they participate, again, in the persecution on account of what the -- what the force exerted against them was?                  Well, that just bring you back to what "assistance" means.                  If you -- normal statutory canon, you have got "ordered," "incited," "assisted."                  "Assistance" can be read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms of an active -- I don't know what it is -- predisposition or desire.           Or it can be read in the manner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it for -- for the paycheck. So, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms, then I think your response falls short.                   Well, but that argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney General can exercise his discretion and not afford relief.   But on the other hand, it could go to some of the horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in those circumstances the Attorney General could exercise his discretion to afford relief.                   And so too would, I gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he doesn't build the prison walls, right?                  He knows they are going to be used to persecute people and hold them in.   I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme interpretations they go either way.                   Does he -- does he persecute people on account of race?                   We have a prison here; we are going to hold members of a particular racial group here, and we are going to force you to build the walls.                  Well, speaking of -- to get back to the language, what's wrong with saying, you have a clause that says "otherwise participated," right?                   So that must mean, I gather, or could mean that "assisted" does not have as broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the "otherwise participated" language would be unnecessary and redundant.                   Right.                   Well, I'm not sure that's right, because if "otherwise participated" covers -- "assisted" does not include "otherwise participated," and I understood your broad reading of "assisted" to cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say "assisted" needs to be interpreted with "ordered" and "incited," and if it is, then "otherwise participated" should be interpreted along the same lines.                   So you think there was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?                   What I may have missed, what was your answer to the prison walls?                    The guy who builds the prison walls?                   Is he or is he not participating in the persecution?                     Your concession -- statement earlier on, that there are going to be situations for judicial line-drawing --                     And it suggests to me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under Chevron step two.    Because what you are saying is this is not a situation where the statute never applies. In a situation where you can logically determine and your answer on the knowledge question is pertinent, you can logically draw a line between what a person's doing and persecution; and yet you said the c courts are going to have to draw lines.                   So BIA -- the board might get discretion with respect to where that line is drawn and when, but they do not get discretion on the question of does it ever apply.                   And what your position is, that this never applies, whenever there is a but-for logical intention between the action and persecution.                    But you would say the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their hair is cut, right?                    You would view that as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the person is not going to be executed unless the woman does her job?
07-512 +++$+++                    Yes.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blecher? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAXWELL M. BLECHER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Counsel, I am confused --                   I am confused about what you mean when you say "the price squeeze claim."                   Is that any different -- is that any different than a Brooke Group claim?                   So you still want to be able to argue that --                    -- above-cost retail prices --   -- somehow violate Brooke Group?                    And you -- you agree that that requires --                    That requires below-cost retail pricing?                    Is the wholesale price claim that the Ninth Circuit looked at in -- in the case below, in the decision below, a necessary or significant or partial element of your Brooke Group claim, or is it totally irrelevant?                  Well, I guess it would have been nice if you thought the case was essentially moot, to hear about that in the cert opposition.                  You didn't argue that the decision below was essentially moot in your opposition to certiorari here.                      Justice Breyer's draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below. Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the price squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong.                       You don't just throw it out and let everybody go home.                       You say whether it was right or wrong.         And if you are saying it's wrong, we would reverse.                   You are saying we don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke Group predatory pricing claim will say that the prices here were below cost?                   So we don't have to consider, I guess, what I thought we had to consider --                    And you are not going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on remand?                    Which you understand to require that the retail prices be below cost?                   But the reason you think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit didn't decide the question, but because you are willing not to press it?                      So, I guess -- I guess that's where we are about to go.                    But in answer to Justice Alito's question, if you think the Ninth Circuit was wrong and don't want to see those claims raised again, we need to address the merits and reverse?                      Thank you, counsel.                      Mr. Brunell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD M.

MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   So -- so the statute reads the same whether "now" is in there or not?                You read it as saying any recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction.                   So you're saying the only way that makes sense is to read it as if it weren't there.                   Oh, so you're applying now, when you're talking about who is of Indian descent --                   -- Indian descent of those in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other words, you say the Indian descent as of when?                   Oh, I see.                  What do you do about United States v. John?       There the Court in describing an Indian, Indian descent, went out of their way to include in brackets the phrase "any recognized in 1934 tribe now under Federal jurisdiction"?                     Well, but it -- it may have shown it's ambiguous, but it shows how -- shows how we resolved the ambiguity.                   This is -- we are talking about an extraordinary assertion of power.                 The Secretary gets to take land and give it a whole different jurisdictional status apart from State law and all -- wouldn't you normally regard these types of definitions in a restrictive way to limit that power instead of saying whenever he wants to recognize it, then he gets the authority to say this is no longer under Rhode Island jurisdiction; it's now under my jurisdiction?                   Well, how do we know which one of them benefits the Indian?                  I mean, have the Indians benefited from Federal jurisdiction in the last 50 years?                   What are the plans the Indians have of doing with the land once it's determined to be Indian land subject to trust of the Federal Government?                   Yes, of course, the use of that land would not be limited to housing, right? They could engage in other activities that Indian tribes can engage in, correct?                  Of course, your friend on the other side says the exact opposite.                     It was backward-looking.       They had had the allotment policy, which they decided was not a good idea, and yet, that had resulted in Indian land being turned over to in fee simple, and this is a way to compensate for the discredited allotment policy. So, if you weren't recognized in 1934, you were not penalized by the allotment policy, so you didn't need the benefit.          I think that backward-looking perspective seems to make perfect sense.                   An Indian -- an Indian community.     Now, if we are looking for a definition of "Indian," we go back to the first sentence.                   Well, if it does it four times, you ought to give effect to it at least once.     It says "Indian tribes now under Federal jurisdiction."     It seems to me that that is the key restriction, and that it's not taken away by that last sentence, which again reiterates that it's "Indian tribe."     And then in the last clause to which you refer, it's still "Indians residing on one reservation."                   It's a defined term.                   Of course if we just -- I'm sorry to jump back to the other provision, but if we disagree with your interpretation and Congress thinks we are wrong they can pass another one of these 15, 16 provisions that they have that says this tribe is -- is recognized now.                   Why -- why else -- why would Congress then enact these 15 or 16 separate provisions if they think the -- if in this provision they think it's not necessary?

Belton adopted a bright-line rule.    The whole point of a bright-line rule is that you don't look at the specific facts and it presents a problem here you say the guy is handcuffed and in the back of the car?             Well what if he is in the back of the car but not handcuffed?                      What if there are five people around who might break open the police car and free him?    What if there are three people around? You have exactly the same case by case inquiry that Belton said we are not going to do.                  Which one is not.                  Are those all preThornton.                  Well in Thornton of course the guy was handcuffed in the back of the police car.                  I guess my question is what is left of the Belton bright-line rule when you are done.                  We have to have a to determine a threat to officer safety.                      Assuming the decision is wrong.                  Just not to get back -- Mincey was 1978.          Belton was 1981.                  Yes, but I'm trying to see -- you cited three cases.                And my question was whether those survived Belton.               Now, were all three of those before Belton?                    Just to explore that, that does seem to me to be overruling Belton to the extent Belton adopted a bright-line rule.                      What you're saying is, well, in these circumstances Belton applies, and in these circumstances, it doesn't.                      But you're overruling Belton when you say there's no longer a bright-line rule.                   So you think after Belton -- you think after Belton, we still have to look and see what's reaching distance on a case-by-case basis?                    I don't understand that part:     "Arguably within the reach."                  I don't understand that to be part of Belton.                     I thought that's what Belton did away with, and thought Belton was saying, look, we are going to have a bright-line rule, because we don't want to say he's five feet away, he is not within the reach; two feet away, he is.                    Do you think Belton kept the requirement that the person be arguably within the reach of the compartment?

I'd just trying to understand your earlier answer.    It just took me a little while before you got off on the other point. You're saying it was lawful at the time to deliberately discriminate on the basis of pregnancy -- Gilbert -- but that that was somehow unlawful if in fact your deliberate discrimination had a disparate impact?                   Well, maybe I'm missing it.    Isn't it a bit unusual to say it's perfectly all right to discriminate intentionally, but if it has a disparate impact, that's not all right?                  No, I -- I don't think it's every disparate impact case.                     In a disparate impact case, it's because you can't show, typically, deliberate discrimination, so you look at what the impact was.   But I guess I've never heard of a case where it's okay to do something intentionally, but it's illegal -- to discriminate intentionally, but it's illegal if that has a disparate impact.                  Well, but Gilbert said it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex, because it said that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex; and yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on the basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the base of sex.                   Is your -- is there any other -- can you cite a case to me where we have held there is discriminatory treatment, but that's lawful, but the discriminatory impact of that is unlawful?

And that's an argument you can make before the Ninth Circuit on remand.                    Well, why don't we just take them at their word?            As you say, they are applying the wrong nomenclature.              It would be easy enough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we meant, you know, harmless error under Brecht.                 But that seems to me to be at least an open question.                   Under Brecht, you have the burden of showing a substantial injurious effect.                     So you think you win under Brecht?                     You think the Ninth Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually applied the Brecht standard?                     Sure.     Well, then it seems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht standard -- and the government -- that the Brecht standard applies.                     And all the fight is over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard or not?                   Why don't we just send it back and ask them?          Say:       We can't tell.

07-552 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Englert. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   We're not under any body of law.    I didn't see any cases cited after we had more carefully explicated our understanding of Article III.     What's the latest case from this Court that you've got?                  Counsel, you say in your brief that there is no reason for concern about the absence of concrete adverseness.               But I would have thought there was a great deal of reason for concern and that your client doesn't care if he wins or loses.                  It's all the same to him.   If he wins, he doesn't get to keep the money; if he loses, he loses.                  I thought the question came to us on the assumption that he doesn't retain any of the money.                  But I thought our cases made clear that that kind of -- -- I forget what we call it -- it's a separate interest from the injury that you're alleging in the lawsuit.                   You don't allege in the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is that you're in this line of work and if the work dries up you're in big trouble.         That wouldn't be enough to support Article III standing.                  Well, but then why is the assignee bringing the lawsuit?                  He had no independent injury.                   I'm sorry, we got off the track here.                   I'm trying to find out what the assignee's injury is.                   And how it's redressed by the receipt of the money.                   No.   But you know, Vermont Agency, obviously, the assignee recovers something himself, that he gets to keep the bounty. Here that's not the case.                   The Sierra Club protect -- undertakes activities to protect the environment, but that doesn't give it standing in every environmental case to sue.         It needs to show members what the concrete interest and so on.                  The fact that your client is in the business of suing on behalf of payphone operators --                   Speaking of one cent for tribute, it's easy to get rid of this problem, isn't it?                   Why don't your agreements just say you get to keep $10 out of every sum that your recover?      Then we wouldn't have this problem.                   So why --                   Why doesn't the tie go to Article III?      I mean if it makes no difference either way I'd like to preserve significance of Article III as a limit on court jurisdiction.                  Well, but --                  Well, Article III does trump tradition.     I mean, if it doesn't meet Article III, no amount of tradition can save it.                    And you several times refer, when asked one of these questions, to the tradition and the old cases, but I haven't heard an answer yet to the concrete injury that is suffered by the aggregators.                    In all of those cases, the class action, the trustee, you know, the named plaintiff, the named trustee has concrete injury and redressability to themselves?                   Very much more than your clients.   The trustee has legal obligations that he has to discharge.    If it's a suit that he has to bring on behalf of the beneficiaries and doesn't do it, he is sued for breach of trust.           In a class action case, the representative has to have standing, has to show concrete injury and redressability.                      Here we don't have any of that.
07-562 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    How is that consistent with what the Court said in the Riegel case where they said, and I'll quote:              "We have held that a provision pre-empting State requirements pre-empted common law duties"?     That's no suggestion that this is a distinction between a focused common law duty, which would be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.                  You say Riegel wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue. It was making a general point.               The Court said:     We have held that a provision pre-empting State requirements, which is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common law duties.                  So as a general proposition -- I understand your position to be that this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in response to Justice Alito's question was that general common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored ones are.                     You agree that a general common law duty can be pre-empted by a particular statute?                     So you're -- so you're saying that we should -- the difference in your case is that the language here is narrower.                    It says "no statement relating to smoking or health."                    I don't see how that language is narrower.                     Okay.   So 1334(b) says "no requirement or prohibition with respect to." Isn't that just as broad?                   How do you tell -- how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you don't look at what the relationship is between smoking and health?    They have an advertisement that says light cigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes. You have to know what the relationship is between smoking and health to determine whether that's deceptive.                   That's the relationship between smoking and health.                   Mr. Frederick, did I understand you earlier to say that your complaint did not seek injunctive relief?                   Page 42A of your amended complaint says you ask the Court to grant such injunctive relief as may be appropriate.                   Thank you, Mr. Frederick.  Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  It will not surprise you that my first question is, why did the United States not address the express pre-emption argument and, second, what is the position of the United States on the express pre-emption argument?                  All right.        Well, that's why you didn't address it.                Now, what is the position of the United States?              It's a statute that is directed to an area in which the Federal Government has an extensive interest in regulation, and I would have thought there'd be a position on that.                    It is logically antecedent to the implied pre-emption.                    You would consider whether there is express pre-emption before implied pre-emption.                   Well, it's not anymore.     I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give up on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.                   Implied pre-emption is all that you address, right?                   So it should be pretty easy for you to win on that. (Laughter.)
07-581 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    It wouldn't be unilaterally imposing, right?             He would say if you're going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual employee.     And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't happen.     You say, well, the employer has a lot of leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the individual and the company.                      Well, isn't that kind of conflict always present whenever you have collective action?      I mean, you may be a particularly good worker and could demand a higher wage than the union has negotiated, but you're still bound by the collective bargaining agreement.                 That happens in every situation where you have collective action.                      Well, they don't have to be vindicated in particular ways.                   The individuals can agree to arbitrate these claims, and they would be -- the arbitration would be binding.                   Well, they may go the other way.    They may say:            Look, we don't like to arbitrate.   In fact, the arbitration is of great benefit to workers, but it is very expensive to bring these claims, even with the prospect of recovering fees. Most of them like the idea that the union is going to stand up for them and take it to management, but they could say:       Look, we don't want it.                If -- if you are discriminated against, you know, sue us.                   But under my scenario, the employer wouldn't have to pay for arbitration.     There would be -- there would be no arbitration at all.                   No.    There is no arbitration.     The employer says:              Look, I don't think I discriminate.     I've got a good record.                  I'm not going to agree to arbitrate claims.            I'm going to make people go to court because there will be fewer claims brought.                    But the point is there are benefits to employees from arbitration as well.                    The employer may not agree to it.     If he doesn't have any protection, if it doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to court, what's the -- what's the point?                    Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                   You have -- you have focused on the fact that Congress has given individual rights.    But for the many matters that you say are the subject of collective bargaining, you don't need a statute.     I don't need a statute to negotiate with someone whether I get paid $20 an hour or $15 an hour for a particular job.      And, yet, that is something that you give up when you join the union, and you are subject to collective bargaining.                   Well, why isn't it -- why isn't it the same with these statutory rights? Why aren't they subject to collective bargaining as well?                   No.    No.   I am -- the -- the forum for asserting the right.                   Why would any employer want to agree to arbitration under this system? He gets nothing from it.         You said you get the ben -- to arbitrate except when you don't arbitrate.                   That just begs the question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is correct.                   Your position -- so their position is going to hurt most employees, because assuming that the employer wants to arbitrate, the union gets something in return for agreeing to that.                  I don't know what it is, another 50 cents an hour, if you agree to arbitrate all these claims.               Well, you don't get that anymore, because and employer is not going to agree to arbitrate if it -- if the employees don't have to arbitrate.                  Well, the employees have no -- no leverage.         I mean, if the -- if the employer wants to say, look, if you want to work here, look, you got to arbitrate -- I mean, the employees don't have bargaining leverage.               That's the whole reason you have a union.
07-582 +++$+++                    Thank you, General Garre. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                     What the Commission said is that the prior decisions or guidance was seriously flawed and we reaffirmed that it was appropriate to disavow it. It seems to me that is recognizing a change and rejecting it.    It's at page 82a.                   That seems to me to be the same question that I asked your friend:                   does it matter?   Don't we look at the Commission's order and determine whether it's a reasonable explanation, whether they view it as a change or not?                 It seems to me that they kind of said you can view it as a change because the staff had these decisions, and there was dicta; or it's not a change.      But the point -- important point is whether or not they provided a reasonable explanation for their current position.                   What it says in State Farm -- what it says in State Farm is that an agency's view of what is in the public interest may change either with or without a change in circumstances.                   The reason there is a change is they looked at it and they decided it was wrong.                   You agree it's enough of a justification for the change that they think the other policy was wrong?            They don't have to say circumstances have changed, the facts are different; it's enough to say, "well, whatever the Commission used to thing, we think differently"?                   And then explain why.                    But that's not the Commission's position.       The Commission's position here is not when these words were used, people necessarily thought of a literal meaning; instead, its position is that the reason these words shocked is because of its association with the literal meaning.                   That's a different question than what was being addressed in Cohen.                   Then why -- why do you think the F-Word has shocking value or emphasis or force?                   Because it is associated with sexual or excretory activity.                  That's what gives it its -- its force.                    How is that consistent with Vermont Yankee?                    So, you are saying that we add to the APA when we are dealing with a particular area.    Which of our cases --                    Which of our cases supports that?                    Well, maybe sometime --                    -- to be in a position to argue your constitutional issue, but we can't assume that you are right on the Constitution in applying the APA.                    Well, when you talk about the rule of lenity, I mean, the point is that this change -- if there is a change in policy or whether it's adequately explained -- simply gets you in the door. They say then, once you are there, we just look at all of the circumstances and the context.                   So, we don't -- it seems to me in their enforcement decisions, their decision not to impose sanctions, their decision not to have this count against you in future proceedings, they are being very lenient.                   And this is where the context comes in.       At least with impressionable children, that's dramatically different from saying here is an awards show, here is a celebrity, I want to listen to what they are going to say because I listen to their music, and he comes out with that, as opposed to a football.    They know that, you know, somebody says a bad word in the middle of the interview.                     The context makes all the difference in the world.                   They perceive that. They know.    I mean, it's one thing to use the word in, say, Saving Private Ryan, when your arm gets blown off. It's another thing to do it when you are standing up at an awards ceremony.                      Why -- the young football player is not a celebrity that they follow.                      The point is whether they are or not is the contextual determination that the FCC can undertake.      All they are saying is that just because it's used once doesn't mean you are out of the -- out of the woods altogether.                Let's look at it, and if it turns out there's no -- I mean, this is the point they make, that in one context, it's completely gratuitous; in the other context, it's not.                  Then why do your clients not use these words between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.?                  Why do you think it affects audience share?                  If you can take that into consideration, why can't the FCC make the same determination, that there may be some people offended by this, and if there are some people, as part of our statutory responsibility, we are going to look at it. Not that they automatically impose --                  Not that they automatically impose a sanction, but that they're going to look at it.                   But that is not the appropriate approach.

LAZARUS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    Isn't that -- isn't that exactly what they did here in listing what they call a suite of technologies or approaches that is available?     I thought that was exactly what they did. They said for different locations, different technologies may be the best available.                   Counsel, your argument is focused on proving that your interpretation won't lead to insane results, as you put it.                But you have to do a lot more than that.              I mean, you have to establish that this is not ambiguous language.                  Well, if you get to that money in the bank, does this mean that best technology available changes over time?                      I mean, maybe the industry could have borne these costs two years ago, but they probably can't today.               Nobody has money in the bank today. (Laughter.)                  So you think they could have said, two years ago, this is what you have to do, but today they would say you don't have to do that anymore --                   -- even though the technology is still available.                      Counsel --                      You would have to agree, wouldn't you, that the panel's decision in this case overruled the prior panel's decision in judge Katzman's decision in Riverkeeper 1?                      Well, in Riverkeeper 1 what Judge Katzman said is that we think EPA was permitted to consider costs and energy efficiency in determining the best technology available.                    He was deciding it on the basis of availability, too.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTHA COAKLEY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Well, I'm looking at footnote 10 in your brief on page 30.                    And you concede that some interpretation of the machine-generated data ordinarily is required.         Now why isn't that a suggestion that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation, and you might have different analysts coming out differently and so you need to get the fellow there and ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion? Or this is subjective; I guess some people read it one way or the other one way; which way do you always read it?    That kind of stuff.                   Well, I didn't -- I didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you cite, but you say some interpretation is required.                     So what type of interpretation?                   I think California did not join the amicus brief.                  What if it's the central issue in the case?           The defense says, "That stuff I was carrying was not cocaine.                    Either I was trying -- you know, I was going to stiff the person I was selling it to or whatever."               That's the sole defense.   That's not cocaine.             All you've got to do is submit an affidavit from the lab guy saying, "I tested it; it is"?                     Thank you, General.

DE NICOLA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  I would suppose that there are a lot, a lot of situations in which a dead victim has made statements pertinent to the murder.                    So wouldn't your rule drive a pretty big hole through Crawford? This is not an isolated instance where the victim said something about the murderer.                    That would seem to be a fairly common situation, because most murders involve people who know each other.                   I think you're -- it's certainly true that this issue would come up in domestic abuse cases --                   -- but I'm not sure that it would be at all limited.              I assume you have, you know, gang cases --                   -- any case in which have you familiarity between the victim and the defendant, which, as I understand it, is the most typical case, but it's not simply in any way limited to the domestic abuse cases.                  No, I know your rule wouldn't --                  --   but the situation in which the case arises --                  -- also would --                  -- certainly not. It comes up quite frequently, I would assume --                  -- because you often have an association with --

Read it without the word "committed." It not only has the same effect, but it's more natural, because it's "use of force by a current or former spouse," as opposed to "use of force committed by."                  It's drafted the way it should have been if your friends are correct.                   I'm sorry.   Is that the right list?   That's -- that's statutes passed after 1996.                   I looked at the amicus brief filed by the National Network, page 18 footnote 53, and I see California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio.   Which is the right list?                   Thank you, counsel.
07-610 +++$+++                      Thank you counsel. Mr. Collins? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                     But that's not what we are talking about.       It doesn't have to go it alone. It simply can't force members of another unit that can decide they are happy to support it but the members who don't want to support it who don't like unions, they can't be forced to pay for it if it does not relate to their collective bargaining agreement.                    If the litigation is not germane to the unit where people object to that unit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free riding on anything.                    What if there is no -- I guess I'm getting into the solace thor general's position here.   What if the unit with the objective members does not have a right to call upon the pool? Either, or has never called upon the pool in its unlikely that it will.       Isn't there, it's not simply subsidization.   It's their compelled fees being used for something that doesn't Ben fate their collective bargaining arrangement.                   Exactly -- I'm sorry.     I was just going to say exactly so I regard that issue as still open.        It was not addressed at all in Lehnert.                    So if you have a situation where there is a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the employer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the local up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra -- extra-unit litigation even though it will never have any benefit for it?                    I thought it meant -- I didn't think Lehnert held that the unit would have to support that type of extra-unit litigation.                  I mean, I --                   Yes.   Yes, there is a provision that is ambiguous, which frequently happens, and the union says that requires air conditioning, and the company says no, and there is a big fight about that.                   Well, sure, because that negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska collective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating it there for that unit.                  Do you think as a covenant of support you have -- however many -- about a thousand individual units.           You think each of those, you have a covenant to support them when they all get -- get involved in separate litigation?                You can't possibly.                  So it's quite unlike, for example, insurance.               If you have insurance and you as the unit have a particular obligation, you have a right to have that covered.                  There is no similar right here.                   So we are talking about an infringement on the objecting members' first amendment rights, and your answer is trust us, we'll treat you fairly?    I understand that it's a different answer if you say you've got a right.                    We can impose the contribution requirement on you, even though you object to it because under this agreement, you have a right to call upon our services.         That's a different case.            But if your answer is simply trust us we'll treat you fairly, that's not the usual standard we apply to infringements of First Amendment rights.                   That's different. That's a little bit more stringent than saying trust us. That's saying let's look at the last year and we'll figure it out.                   So if we determine as a matter of First Amendment law that such a requirement is necessary, then you lose, because you're saying we can't possibly fashion the test?                   Lehnert didn't address the question of litigation.                   Well, that's not right.   Again we have to postulate that we are dealing with members who don't like unions at all.                 So while the members may think this is perfectly fair, the nonmembers whenever their money is forced to be used for union activities, it's unfair.
07-615 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Bederman. Mr. Hallward-Driemeier. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE                  But it's not our job to help you -- it's not our job to help you in other tribunals.   If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot. We are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit to revise its opinion just because that's helpful to you.                  So is it your position that that -- that is moot?                   So why isn't the consequence that you are so worried about under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the same consequence that is going to come from the fact that these assets are blocked?                   But --                   I guess this may be the same question Justice Breyer asked.                      I mean, where do you cut this off?       You've got the proceeds from the sale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then Cubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with those proceeds and then sells it to somebody else.                         I mean, are those still assets at issue in the claims before the tribunal?                   Well, that's kind of a -- that's a broad assertion.               In other words, so long as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not saves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to be a very self-serving legal test.                   Thank you, counsel.                    So that if you had these military assets, which are clearly the assets that are at issue in Iran's claim --                    Cubic is worried about what to do with it and so they sell them to the Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under the theory that look we may end up owing this to the Iranians under the tribunal.             Under the setoff, this may not be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a claim to these.    Would those -- would those escrow funds be assets at issue?                  Well, why is that very different from this situation, where you have an arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the equivalent of what you should have -- what you would have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the revolution?                   The agreement between who -- between who --                   So Iran, I assume, would say, look, we entered into this agreement to take the place of what was at dispute.                 Which is what they owed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we paid for.    I don't see that that adds anything to your argument.                   Right, so Iran says, look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever it is, you are not --                   You were not going to give us the money, right?                   And we still have a dispute.    So, I tell you what, you are going to sell this stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money from them, and we have got an agreement that that money is ours.                    Well, why would Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed them in the original agreement?                    Do you know why it was pending for ten years?                   So the stayed because it was at issue before the Iranian claims tribunal?                      Well, but the point is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one single case.     We -- the argument would be the United States is not living up to the obligations it undertook in the Algiers Accords.                    What provision -- can you cite me the provision where the Congress said put your thumb on the scale?                    11a.   And how does that -- the title of the section says statutory construction.   I just don't see what follows as statutory construction.                   You don't see any --                   You don't see any problem with Congress telling us how to conduct statutory construction?

KRUGER ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE                  Am I right in understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split on that question, even that majority of the circuits are contrary to the Government's position?                   And which circuits are on the other side?                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Levy. ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK I. LEVY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   No, no.   But is that a case in which the question the court decided was presented in the petition, the court said we are not going to take that question then they decided it on that ground anyway.                  I guess you agree that it's a question of which the circuits have split, so presumably there are good arguments on both sides, and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full opportunity to brief here.           So we'd have to be pretty confident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide it.                      Well, why -- why do they have to worry about that?                The simplest thing is for the participant to change the designation, and if there's a divorce, the divorcee is no longer a spouse under the terms of the plan, so he is free to do that. It seems odd to me that they have this elaborate QDRO provision when it shouldn't be necessary.                    But another alternative is that all you can -- you can cross out this name and put in another, or you can go to court, get this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan. I mean, why would anybody do that?                   Not, not obviously. I mean it depends what the divorce is.                   She got the Mercedes, right?    I mean, she can get -- it depends on the divorce arrangement, not anything under ERISA, once she is a nonspouse.

I mean, what about the hypotheticals on the other side?    I mean, you have a Statue of Liberty; do we have to have a statue of despotism?                Or do we have to put any president who wants to be on Mount Rushmore?                   How do you answer those?                     So, it's frozen into time.   Everything up until now is okay, but anything going forward is not?                     Well, I thought you said the Government can accept what's there and say that's our speech.      But you're challenging the ability to do that going forward.                  Well, but it does all the time.    The -- you don't get equal time -- the cigarette companies don't get equal time because the Government says the Surgeon General has determined it is bad for your health.       It always suppresses alternative viewpoints.                   Does it depend on -- given the focus on public perception, does it depend on the content of the speech?           In other words, if you came across a monument and it said, "The Eagles are a lot better than every other organization, you should give money to the Eagles," someone is going to walk by that and say, "Well, that's probably not the City, that's probably the Eagles."       But the Eagles, you know, for all the good they do, did not come up with the Ten Commandments, and somebody is going to look at that and say, "That's probably the City."                They are not going to look at that and immediately say, "That's what the Eagles believe."

JORDAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Can't we leave that -- and you suggest that it is a Federal rule.                    I am not sure that's right.         Why don't we just leave that up to the States?   I am not -- if I don't accept your friend's determination that this is a matter of substance rather than form, States have it -- excuse me -- within their control.              Here -- your State calls it another direct appeal. Why don't we just take them at their word? And if they don't want to get into the business of having a Federal review of a second direct appeal that they choose to allow, they just call it something else. Call it a -- you know, the collateral review of a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and file whatever.      And then, you know, under AEDPA that wouldn't count as a new final judgment.                  Well, I -- I was just going to stop you there.              It doesn't say that starts to run at the expiration of direct review.                  It says on the date the judgment became final.                  -- by the conclusion of direct review.                     Do you have a case to cite for that?    Because I understood your friend to say the opposite:    That wouldn't count as an impediment.                     How do I resolve that dispute?                   When you say "the first habeas petition" you mean the first State habeas petition?                   Okay.     I'm sorry.                   I'm sorry.   What do you mean, "(d)(2) tolling still applies"?                 That the direct appeal time does not count against his one year?                      Well, I thought, Counsel, that your response to that was when you have a failure of counsel, that that is imputed to the State. So it is a removal of an impediment created by the State.                   So, do I understand correctly that, based on your answers and your friend's answers, there is no difference between the way you two in substance read these provisions?                    He relies on (d)(1)(A); you rely on the combination of (d)(2) and (d)(1)(B) and (d); except in the situation where you have a non-diligent prisoner, and in that case, his theory leads to a different result than yours. He excuses the non-diligence because the State chooses to label the second opportunity as final. You do not excuse the non-diligence because in the absence of diligence, (d)(1)(B) and (d)(1)(D) do not apply.                   Then it comes down -- it does come down to his, where he began his argument, which is he said that this is an unusual case where Texas is being overly generous to convicts, because you choose to label it as direct appeal and therefore that means someone that the States allow to have another direct appeal, even though they have been non-diligent, get the benefit of the -- of a new finality date.                  What about -- he cited most prominently the Evitts case.
07-751 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Metzler? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE P. METZLER, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     YOU -- was Mr. Stewart correct that you concede that if this person entering the house were in fact a police officer, that this would have been okay?                     That's a tough -- at least I find it a very difficult question.                     I do not find it necessarily a terribly difficult question whether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was clearly established, precisely because I find the underlying questions difficult.                So you have a handful Court of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual variation; the issue is whether to extend the police coming in to a confidential informant, all of those questions are very difficult; but precisely because they are, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is adopted, is clearly established. Why don't -- and yet if I were on the lower court of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say, I have got to decide that very difficult constitutional question and then decide what's a very easy qualified immunity question.      Does that -- why does that make sense?                     But concede for purposes of argument that it is a difficult question. Why don't we just tell the lower courts -- we do it, we go right ahead to the qualified immunity question by not granting cert on one.      Why shouldn't the lower courts have the same luxury?                   Why, because we need to provide guidance on that question?                   Well, do you think it can't come up any other way?                   Yes.                   Or a -- or a suit against the political subdivision, right?                    You could have sued some other political entity other than the officers individually, right?                  Well, but that was my question.    There are other ways for the law to develop.   The issue can come up on merits in the suit against the municipality which doesn't raise the qualified immunity question.             If you come up -- if you have a search where a person sues to get whatever was seized back.    You know, if there's a -- and also the option is, if the question of which order want to proceed is optional, the law can develop if the courts for good and sufficient reason decide to reach the constitutional question first. I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult constitutional issue and then not worry about it because in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.                    Well, but my point though is that at least in my experience it was unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to decide not just a factual question but a constitutional question in a context where it wasn't necessary.                    Doesn't the fact that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean that it's not clearly established?                   If the Tenth Circuit says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is that clearly established that it's not allowed in the Tenth Circuit?                  Then it is irrelevant.    Then it is irrelevant that ten other circuits have decided it differently.                  Well, right, but do the police officers get to decide that?                  Do they get to decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten other circuits think this, and it has been five years since the Tenth Circuit.          I mean, do they have to go through that type of analysis?                   Do any of the other cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve confidential informants as opposed to police officers?                   Yes.                    So at the time every circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police officer and a confidential informant, I think that could be considered a police officer because he is going to call the police in -- every court of appeals decision involving a confidential informant said it was okay.                    And in those circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between the police officer and the confidential informant?                    Do you believe that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to look at in addressing this question, a case involving a confidential informant?                   Why is that?                   Why isn't it that the issue hasn't come up, this question of a confidential informant is one that hasn't come up?                Why would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?                    No, but then he is going to get sued.                   How do you decide whether the confidential informant should be considered an employee of the police?         Let's say this is the tenth undercover operation he has engaged in.                   They give him $100 after every undercover operation.                   I mean, is he an employee of the police department?                   Why doesn't -- that doesn't make him an agent of the police?                   He wasn't acting on his own.    He was acting for the police.                He didn't decide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I want to do it, and it just so happens the police are involved as well.

On November 1st, 1964, this was an appointed position.      This is not a change from what was, quote, "in force or effect" on November 1st, 1964.                  Oh, no, no.    Those decisions are all dicta.                  So something else changed --                  -- whether they are membership elections or at-large elections.                  The argument you made in your brief was that this was already decided in Reno versus Bossier Parish.             I didn't see the --                  Is the argument that this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?                  No. argument -- you at least thought they did -- No.  brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case. I'm thinking of one other.                  Yes.    And you raised the argument -- you criticized them for raising this argument; that this wasn't any different; but you did not say that it wasn't any different.                  I think you're quite right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I just don't see how that squares with the statutory language.                  So because we've ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget about it here?                  I thought that -- they ratified -- these cases were ratified by Congress, but Congress did not change the language in the statute.                  Thank you, Ms. Karlan. Mr. Shanmugan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE APPELLEES                  What if the district court -- circuit court I guess it is in Alabama.                  This action is filed before the election and the circuit court says:    You may have a successful claim here, but I'm not going to disrupt the election, there isn't time; so this election can go forward and during that period I'll be considering the law.            We do that all the time, or three-judge district courts do, saying we're going to look at this question, but we don't have time to stop the election so it's going to go forward.                In that case, would that lead to the same result?                  Well, sure, but not always.   You know, if it's a week before the election or something, even if they think it's a serious claim, they sometimes say:   We're going to allow the election to go forward because we're going to look at this and perhaps the State Supreme Court has to look at it, and we don't want to hold up the election.                  Counsel, you talk about force and effect.        Of course, the statute says "force or effect on November 1st, 1964."                Do you have anything to add to Ms. Karlan's response on my quaint fixation on the language of the statute?                   Well, that can't tie our hands in properly interpreting the statute.                   I don't see how -- regardless of how consistent the interpretation is, how can you read "November 1st, 1964," to mean anything other than that date?                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Newsom, four minutes.
07-772 +++$+++                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Well -- but is that the standard?   You said there is -- they are saying that it's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard. They have -- you have to show that it's objectively unreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the State got it correct.                    You might be able to and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you could read it one way or you could say it another way. And if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it one way is objectively unreasonable when the State court reads it that way.                  So it is not objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct jurors as they did?      If that's all you had, then that would be the point.                   I don't think that your reading of question three is definitive.                     I think it's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of two ways.    If you look at question three, the issue could be whether others could have had an intent, in other words, others in the group, not simply -- it doesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have the requisite intent.                   That's not the question.    There are a number of areas, and I think the first two questions point in the opposite direction. They do not say we don't know whether it's "the crime" or "a crime".    Their questions, neither one, two or three focus on that. It's a more general question that we could read the opposite way.        Perhaps you can read it the way you are, even though it doesn't say is it "the crime" or "a crime". But there again, I think it's incorrect to say it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly not questions one and two, I mean question three is your strongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are focusing on the "the/a" issue.                   Counsel, AEDPA of course requires that this be an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law.                     What is the clearly established Federal law that was unreasonably applied?                       So that's articulated at a fairly general level.                       In Yarborough, we've said that the more general the rule, the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case determination.        So you have a very general rule, and to find an unreasonable application, the court has broad leeway because it is a general rule.                         And you've already said that the instruction does not establish unreasonable application. Given that, isn't it pertinent, although people have objected -- you've objected to the idea that, well, all they did was send them back with the instruction.     So they sent them back with something that you said could be reasonably interpreted correctly.                         So why isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway the State court has because this is a general rule, why isn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable objective?     Yes.                    You've already said that the instruction doesn't get you there.                   And I just heard you say that, with respect to the questions, we can dispute what the jury was asking.                   So it's hard for me to see where you get the objectively unreasonableness if you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if you can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know that they were reflecting the confusion you have here. So is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?                   Thank you, counsel.
07-773 +++$+++                    Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Who gets to frame -- who gets to frame the complaint?               Normally if you're a party and you have a dispute that may implicate Federal law, you have control over the complaint.                You don't have to have a -- you don't have to well plead it in a way that implicates a Federal question.                 You can go out of your way to do it in a way that does not implicate a Federal question; and therefore it would not be, you could not bring it in Federal court. Just as in the diversity example, you can specifically avoid suing people who would create diversity.   But in your position the judge has to in his mind write a complaint and see whether there is jurisdiction or not; and how does the judge decide whether to sue diverse parties or not to sue diverse parties?                      What's hard to figure out, you have, let's say, a franchisee, and you have a dispute with the franchisor.                       And the franchisee says it's an antitrust violation, and I'm going to sue you under the California antitrust law, and he does. And the Federal court says, we've looked through and says, well, you could have sued under the Federal antitrust law.   And you --           yes, I could have; I deliberately didn't.        And then they say, well, this is something that could have been brought in Federal court. And that really deprives a plaintiff of his right to frame his complaint as he sees fit.                      No.     But you just say, is the dispute one that could have been brought in Federal court?                    It's a violation of the Sherman Act.                    Of course, it could be brought in Federal court.
07-8521 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW                    You don't doubt in the scenario Justice Stevens hypothesized that the federal defender would in fact represent the person before the State court.         You are in an emergency stay situation.    He's -- he's allowed to go to federal court. He does so.    The federal judge says, you got to go back to State court.    There's 12 hours left.                  He's not going to say, you know, get another lawyer.                    He's going to represent the person before the state court.                    And I gather he can do that; he's just not going to get paid for that.                  So he presumably --                  So he presumably is spending a huge amount of time and resources on this -- in the nature of these proceedings, and you want to go back and say, all right, on this day you spent six hours redoing your papers that were filed before the Federal judge to file them before the State judge, and you don't get paid the whatever -- how -- what do CJA attorneys get paid these days?                   So he goes back and says:   Look, you don't get that; you know, you get the $15,000 you spent on the last ten days on this but you don't get the $810.     That -- does it seem reasonable to impose that burden on the public defender?                   Since you know as a practical matter, because of professional responsibility that person is going to represent the defendant in the State court proceedings.                   We direct our questions to counsel.                   What do you do with "other"?    I mean, there is no "other" clemency for Federal defendants, right?           It's just executive clemency?                    Counsel, you don't really think the fact that this provision was recodified helps your argument at all, do you?                    When I see that argument, particularly in a gray brief, that strikes me as tantamount to a confession of error.                    You were earlier resisting the notion that the particular legislative history here showed anything because of how broadly it may have been familiar, but there is no evidence at all that when Congress recodified this language it was in fact aware of the different court of appeals decisions you cite, right?
07-854 +++$+++                    Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Why isn't --                   Well, but that goes to the merits, doesn't it?            I mean, if -- I -- you could develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in this way.     But if there is a decision not to -- I mean, immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there has been some violation.           And so the fact that somebody else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good argument to deprive other people of immunity.                   You drew a distinction earlier on between a determination by a prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is absolutely immune, and said this was different.                   But what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over? Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core function?                  Why isn't that the same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't turn this information over.             Here's all -- we are not going to share informant information because we don't think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio. The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going to turn it over.    Why isn't it exactly the same?                   I was surprised by your answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I thought it undermines your case.                You said that you don't have to show that the data system is unconstitutional.    You just have to show that it caused a constitutional violation.             But it would cause a constitutional violation as applied in a particular case.    And you would object to it in that case, and perhaps all this data sharing information system would be very good evidence in that case.                      Look, he didn't turn over this document.          The reason he didn't turn it over is because they've got a policy of not giving them the document.    But your objection would have to be based in a particular case.       And we have already held that in that case there is absolute immunity.                   Exactly.     Now, doesn't that just confirm the concern that has been expressed that all you're doing is circumventing the absolute immunity we recognized at trial.                   Even though the data system, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional violation.   It's the application of it at trial.                    Now, I know that's immune.      You say, well, I'm going to get around it.                  But you began this dialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying -- you don't have to prove that what you are complaining about causes a -- is a constitutional violation.                 You just have to prove that it causes a Constitutional violation.                  In all the examples you just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be that --                  Well, but that gets -- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case. When you are talking about the conduct, you need to link it to a particular constitutional violation.                 The data system has to be linked.         But when you are talking about immunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do with the constitutional violation.                   It's just shuffling paper.
07-869 +++$+++                    Mr. Collins. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                      Did you have any doubt how they would?          I mean, they passed a law dictating that with respect to everybody.                     And then it's pared down by litigation and concessions.                     So, we don't have any real question of what the State is wanting to do here.    It's --                   -- how you can say that this payroll deduction system is some kind of a forum.     A forum is, you know, the corner at Hyde Park or something.     This is -- this is something that governmental entities and private entities do, and they can either exclude this type of activity or they can't. And the problem with the forum analysis is it's all or nothing.     I mean -- and both parties seem to agree:                 If it's a State forum, you could do it; if it's a private forum or if it's an open forum, you can't.                   That's not how we usually analyze these things.                     Why are you -- why are you focusing on heightened scrutiny?                  We have a whole series of cases about employee speech Darcetti and Pickering where it's quite different than heightened scrutiny, and here we are talking about the employees being able to deduct checkoffs from their paycheck for political speech?
07-901 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lannet. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST G. LANNET ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Could I get back to the question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi.                    Is it -- is it your position that if the offense, based on all facts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of 30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could determine that if a firearm was not used in the offense, you would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a problem under Apprendi?                     Then it does.   All the facts authorize a punishment of 30 years.                   And if it's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge.                      But I would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't interpose a jury between the defendant and the State with respect to every element, but only those elements that increase the punishment.                    What if under the law the judge upon sentencing is supposed to make a determination of where the defendant should be sent, which facility, based on determination of which one has the most room.   Is that a determination that has to be made by the jury?                    Even if one was, you know, the most horrendous prison in history and the other was one of -- a country club?                    Yes, but here in my hypothetical it's something that a judge puts in the sentence.   It's just like you've got to, you know, make restitution, you are not eligible for parole, you are going to this place rather than that place.                   What if the -- what if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive to the federal sentence?                  Even if it's subject to judicial review for judicial review for abuse of discretion?                  That doesn't give you an entitlement to that, to the exercise of discretion that isn't abused?
07-9712 +++$+++                       Ms. Schertler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  It's clear, isn't it, that the defendant in this case was in fact prejudiced?    The judge -- Judge Sanders said it's very rare, he said, that you would depart -- or I forget whether it's depart or --                  So rare -- I thought he said "rare to unknown," "to be unknown" -- you are right.                  But I suspect it's probably rarer still for the government to recommend that.    So you can't really say that he wouldn't have done this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it. It's one thing to say I've never heard of that.                  It's another thing when one of your colleagues is there saying, this is what you should do.                      Yeah, but none of us can know what the judge would have done.                  I mean, we have had cases here where the government's recommendation of downward departures has been pretty surprising to me as well, and it's because they were informants or whatever and they have engaged in some pretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders would have done.                     I may have gotten lost in the dialogue.       As you understand it, Justice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right? You get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and it comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the other.                     So you are happy to go along that.                    But that's a big difference, right?      As you said earlier, harmless error, the government has the burden; plain error, the defendant has the burden.            That's certainly going to change how you approach however many different factual contexts.                   I think it's very clear that there has been a breach here.                      And it's not fanciful to say he felt remorse and then he went and did it again.     That happens all the time. You know, when I have a rich dessert I shouldn't have, I feel bad about it afterwards.                      It doesn't mean I will not do it again.                      I mean, why isn't that the case here?                    And you can put that before the judge.     You are supposed to go there and say, "Look, we agreed to recommend it and we do recommend it."    You could say, "And by the way, you should know that he's gone out and done this again."                   But you most -- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you said you would do.                    No, but isn't it the fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would have done if the government had what it said it would do.    And because -- why shouldn't you bear the burden of showing there is no prejudice when you can't tell because you're the one that breached the agreement?                     Maybe Judge Sanders would look at this kind of the way that we have been discussing it, and he would look and say, boy, it's -- it's -- he committed subsequent conduct, how can you recommend that I depart?          He says, but on the other hand, every plea agreement I have seen you always say if he commits subsequent conduct that is illegal, that all bets are the off.    You didn't say that here, so I'm going to take the recommendation seriously. I don't think it's -- maybe I am repeating myself, but I don't think it is at all clear that the result wouldn't be different here.                      He wasn't -- was he convicted of this new crime?                      It was just an allegation, right?                    Why did we assume anything anyway?   I assume he denies the allegations.
07-984 +++$+++                     Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Waldo. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS S. WALDO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                    Of course, the provision that authorizes permits begins by saying "Except as provided in sections 1328 and 1344," and 1344 is 404.   So why doesn't that just take the 404 regime completely out of what you were just talking about?                  The discharges we are talking about have to be discharges of effluent, right?                  My question is, does it apply to solids?                  Well, I guess, I mean, does suspended solids mean there is some liquid involved?                   Like the discharge here.   Now, I think Mr. Olson said these are 55 percent solid by volume.                   Is there a point at which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than a suspended solid?      I mean, 90 percent by weight or by volume, whichever it is, solid?                   Right.                   You wouldn't think something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?                     So if they were just putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water, concrete, into this lake, then you agree that it would be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill provisions that would govern that?                     And so, if they chop up the concrete and put a little water in so that it's easier to move, then all of a sudden it comes under 402 and the EPA's jurisdiction?                     I guess I'm just curious how that makes any sense, since we are talking about putting something into water.                      I mean, does it really matter whether you add the water before it goes into the lake or just the lake adds the water when you put in the solid?                  Even when they -- even fill -- even when they fill a lake?                  So when EPA regulates has regulated these for 40 years, which I assume is up until 2002, then it's -- it's because they don't go into lakes; it's because they go into settling ponds?                    Which are not navigable waters of the United States.                    So the new regulation says the EPA does not regulate it when it goes into -- I can understand why the Army Corps of Engineers doesn't care if it's an impoundment pond or a settling pond, but they do care when it's a lake.                    To fill material as defined in the 2002 regulation?                  Which, which, which -- I'm sorry, which Fill Rule?                  Yes.     You are talking about the preamble.             I'm looking at the definition of fill material in -- whatever -- it's reproduced at page 7a and 8a of the government's brief.                  The -- definition --                      All the fish, there are a thousand fish in this lake, right?                      And those aren't endangered fish; there are millions of them somewhere else, right?                   Is there any aquatic life in this lake other than a thousand fish?                   Microinvertebrae?                   Just to follow up, that's the same point, though, that Justice Alito made: You're testing that right as it comes out, not as it's diluted in the lake.                   I'm sorry, I didn't understand you.   I thought you said that the toxicity in the slurry was tested and killed 99 or whatever percent of these invertebrates.                     Go ahead.

SCODRO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   So your answer to Justice Scalia's question is what?                   Well -- but how do you -- there is no way to tell.             I mean, presumably the State has a reason for restricting the jury pool to the neighborhood, and that type of limitation does go back to Blackstone, the vicinage of the crime.               So -- and the there's no way to tell.       There's no way to tell whether the juror from DuPage County is going to have a different view of a different perspective or affected it in a -- or that it affected the verdict in a particular case.                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D.

You know, the holdout is not going to convict for any reason.                   Well, even assuming your premise, isn't it pretty difficult to know what a rational juror would have done?                   That's because there is no way to tell.                   But a jury is a fundamental protection of individual liberty, and in your analysis you are having a judge decide what the jury would --                   The judge is making a determination that a juror that should have been sitting would act like the juror who was sitting instead.
08-1008 +++$+++                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Landau. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT              Counsel, do I  - do I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the State, for example, limits class actions because it doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions that you could get in a class action.              It only wants to pay when they can be brought on an individual basis. But they may also limit class actions by saying, as Justice Sotomayor suggested, that they are not fair and efficient.     Do you get one result in the former case and a different result in the latter?              How do you -- how do you tell?               I suppose it's pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board basis or on an individual basis?              But I guess --              But -- but wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the class action procedure than they were about its procedural efficiency?       In other words, I understand your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20 million in this fund to pay plaintiffs and we think it's better to go on an individual basis, because if it's a class action, you know, it would be over in one shot or whatever --              -- but it's not appropriate to say, we don't like the class action procedure as a general matter.                And in Justice Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board, which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the latter.               Well, it -- it only reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive choice.   If they say, we are not going to allow class actions because we think, procedurally, they are a bad idea because we think lawyers get too much recovery when they recover -- in other words, it -- your -- your position depends upon a characterization of the ban, and the restriction on class actions is either substantive or procedural.              But the question is New Mexico causes of action.           Can they decide that they don't want actions from outside of the State to be brought as class actions?              What it would do, it seems to me, is make it clear that was not a substantive decision, but, instead, a procedural decision.              Thank you, Mr. Landau.

CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Well, but what -- what if there's an acquittal?             Then you have at least a jury not believing the evidence, and that also is strong support for at least supporting an allegation.                 He fabricated it; nobody believed it when it was presented at trial.                  How -- how do you -- I mean, we hear that type of argument every time, because there is usually a circuit conflict here, and you look at one circuit and say the world hasn't fallen. But you have no idea how many of these claims are asserted and dismissed at an early stage or -- or whatever. You're saying, what, that there haven't been many Second Circuit opinions on this question?                    Do you think there will be -- do you think there will be more if we agree with your theory?                    Well, but it's also you don't really know, right?            In other words, we're concerned about the chilling effect on the prosecutors. We don't know what the impact of the Second Circuit's decision has been on the prosecutors.                     What -- what is the basis for the 1983 claim without the submission at trial?                     Well, you know I'm not talking about the Fourth Amendment violation, which is complete whether there's a trial or not.                   If you cannot rely on anything that goes on at the trial to establish the due process violation, what do you rely on to establish the violation?                  I guess the question is where is it complete, or do you say it doesn't have to be a complete violation?                  Well, let's say that you -- let's say that you can't because we read Imbler as conferring absolute immunity on what goes on at the trial.   And if you can't advert to that, you don't have a constitutional violation, right?                  Against -- against the judge?                  Well, that's the distinction here in this case, isn't it?                  In terms of the chilling impact on the prosecutor, what difference does it make whether it's at trial or pretrial for use at trial?                     Well, we thought it was -- I'm sorry.     Why don't you finish your answer?                     I was going to suggest in response to your point that -- you know, qualified immunity is really significant.                     Of course, it is, but we've recognized, in a number of contexts, in the judicial area, for example, that it's -- it's not enough. We have also recognized that in the prosecutorial area, and trying to draw the line where you do -- I think this was one of the points Justice Alito was making, is that, sometimes, you're investigating and preparing your case at the same time. You don't just sit back and say, I'm -- I'm just going to look and see what I can find.              You have particular areas.     The prosecution requires you to show four things, So you are looking at those four things. You are preparing your case, and you're investigating.                     Well, your approach, then, encourages prosecutors to be trigger happy. They're prosecuting right now because they know, then, that everything else, they have absolute immunity, so -- you know, shoot first and ask questions later.                     No, just begin the formulation.     I'm -- I'm starting to prosecute this person, rather than saying, let's look, let's investigate, let's interview, and then decide who we're going to prosecute.                     In Justice Alito's hypothetical, you've got a CFO, you can -- you know, you've probably got probable cause to go after him as well, but you want to begin interviewing him, to see if he's going to flip in your case against the CEO.                 So you've got -- you've got to make that decision early in the process, rather than later.

Yes, but in this particular case, when you talk about identity theft, it is inconceivable the defendant would not know about fact that there is another person involved.                  And so the -- the mens rea issue is easy in this case.                  The only time it's -- it's difficult is when he didn't -- when he did not use it for an identity-theft purpose.                   Well, but in that case you tell them, look, the person's got 10 years. Right?     If they find the guy, he is going to face up to 10 years for identity fraud.                  Well, the problem with that is the statute says identity theft; it doesn't say anything about victims.

JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES                   So, if -- if -- if lawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your limiting construction works.              If a client comes into a lawyer and says, look, I know we are thinking of filing bankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it; can I do it?    And the lawyer says:                Oh, the law says I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy; the Solicitor General says that means I can't give you advice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of assets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.                 Has that person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?                 Well, the person has asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti?                 And the lawyer, although giving perfectly truthful advice, has effectively conveyed to his client that if he does he would be depriving debtors of assets they might otherwise get.                 He has communicated to the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will have a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the debtors.                    And a reasonable -- my point is a reasonable person reading the brief would say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because that might cause me to do something that would defraud the debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.                    Well, that's one of the things I'm concerned about your limiting construction, "intending to defraud the debtor."                  What if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November? They've always done it.         They are not intending to defraud the debtor.      They are just doing what they have always done.    So an attorney that gives that advice, would be -- that would be okay?                  So if -- so if the lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that fraud turns on the debtor's intent?                 No, but the whole point is that the attorney could be providing advice that would steer the debtor away from doing anything wrong.   And yet the other -- the government would say, oh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay to take the trip to Tahiti.            If he says you can take the trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be read as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink and a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to do?   And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation, not to defraud the debtors.                   You can come up with your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting some that are much more difficult because they depend on particular facts.     And under your construction it seems to me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal, ethical advice has got to pause before every sentence and think, oh, is this going to be construed in violation of subsection (a)(4)?                  But the point is you don't know.     Of course you can't give advice to do something illegal.       But I -- I would think that some of the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to know whether it's illegal.            You yourself say it depends on the debtor's intent.         So if a client came in to me and said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent, as a lawyer I would want to say:                 It depends on why you are doing it.     But if -- but that I think could be construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy.                 This is a regulation of the attorney-client relationship to pursue an unrelated substantive objective.               You want to ensure that debtors don't do something and you think, well, the way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this. You're going to say:     We are going to regulate what lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated objective.                 Well, the objective is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being indirectly enforced by interfering with the attorney-client relationship.   -- or affecting the attorney-client relationship.                 Yes, it's a good way to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice about it. What if a State thinks that there are too many punitive damage awards, that they are out of control, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek punitive damages?                    Oh, if it's done with the purpose of fraud, it is.                  If you think, well, I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard is for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like here if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's illegal, but if you don't it's not.                    Oh, no, no, no, no. Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.                  No, no, no.   It's a difference between filing, because there the lawyer signs the -- signs the complaint.                  It's giving advice to the client. And the -- I guess what I would see as the parallel is that it's an objective outside the attorney-client relationship.              It's not like saying, you can't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or -- or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the client -- protect the client. It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.

It says consistent -- consistent with the procedure which we delineate today.                   Well, maybe, but it says -- it says the -- what the FBI -- the pattern of warning -- well, let me make sure I get it exact. "The present pattern of warnings and respect for the rights of the individual followed as a practice by the FBI is consistent with the procedure we delineate today." And the FBI warning says nothing about presence or with -- or with counsel with him.                Well, okay.   I ll take "consistent with."        That means that it complies with the rule in Miranda.                Then how is the FBI warning consistent with the procedure the Court delineated in Miranda?                No, I said how is it --                Yes.                  So I would say that it's not consistent with Miranda.                  Okay.                What it says is that the respect for the rights of the individual followed in the FBI is consistent with.                Is there -- is there any -- I'm not sure this is pertinent -- but is there any malevolent reason Tampa police would adopt this warning?    I mean, someone says, well, here's what the FBI uses.    And they say, well, I tell you what, if we just say you have a right to an attorney before answering any questions and then later say you can exercise this right any time, maybe we'll be able to trick some people who don't think they can actually have the lawyer there.    In other words was this just --                So -- and you can't think of any bad reason they might have done it.                You -- you think it's a good thing, though, that they changed their forms to track the FBI form after -- after this litigation started.

08-1198 +++$+++                 Thank you. Ms. Pillard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T.L. PILLARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                Isn't that a critical difference, though?             I mean, I understood the fundamental question in -- before getting arbitration is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this dispute with this party. And it's one thing to say that the contract permitted this sort of arbitration; it's another thing to say it didn't preclude it.                And if it didn't preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree -- I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but nothing in the agreement compels me to do that. So which did the arbitrators do?              Did they say, under this contract, you agreed to a class action treatment, in the sense that -- whether it's the language or the intent or whatever -- or did they say we don't find anything here that precludes class action treatment?                Would you show me this -- I see they have quoted from --                -- from the agreement. Where is that in the agreement itself?                Yes.                If you know offhand.                Well, this is -- I'm sorry.    This is what I was wondering.             It is, of course, any dispute arising from -- blah, blah -- performance, termination of this charter party shall be settled in New York. Now, there's -- the class is not a party to this charter party.     So disputes arising from this charter party doesn't involve the class.                 So they did not agree to arbitrate with the class. Now, as I understand what the arbitrators did, they said, well, they didn't preclude it, and so we get to decide how far our authority goes.                  Well, now -- now -- I'm sorry.   I'm just reading along here.               They rejected your argument about "forbids," but the -- they go on to say:   The issue -- we look at this, we look at that to see whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.                So it's enough for them if the parties did not intend to preclude class action.                In -- in any -- in any case -- when you say "arbitrators' toolbox," I'm trying to figure out if that is something different than what the parties agreed to.                Well, that's just saying that they're -- they re giving up a lot.                 This is the basic reason that you require, I thought, fairly clear language that you are agreeing to arbitrate.                    They are giving up their right to go into court.                 They have an agreement between A and B that they will arbitrate a dispute, and they say you are giving up your right to go to court with the dispute between A and C. And the "any dispute" language that you're, you know, quite understandably relying on refers to any dispute arising from the -- making performance or termination of "this charter party."                 "This charter party" says nothing about arbitrating with C.                Oh, but they can agree to arbitrate.     They can agree to arbitrate with some and not with others, even if it's the same contract.   They may decide that your client is a very reasonable person; they are happy to submit that to arbitration. Or it's a very big and important client, and they don't want to get into court with you.                 They may decide some other party, for whatever reason, they don't want to get dragged into court with them.                 Same charter party, different -- different parties --                 -- and different results.                 Go ahead.                Allowing.                Allowing.   See, that's where I get hung up.     There s a difference in arbitration -- and it's a fundamental difference -- between allowing something and a background rule that requires it if you don't say anything about it. The difference I see with the hypothetical Justice Breyer put is that you are talking about the details of a contract once it's agreed there is a contract.    There's a contract that governs the relationship between the employer and the employee, and you're trying to figure out if it says anything about where they eat lunch. This is the much more fundamental issue of whether you've even agreed to arbitrate with this person.     Is this guy your employee or just somebody who came in off the street? And I think what your brother's position is, is that this is just somebody who came off the street; the class members.     I didn't agree to do anything with them.                  So --                  I -- I --                Well, that's -- that's what it comes down --                That's what it comes down to --   -- whether it's an interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators the authority to proceed on a class basis. Not enough, right, under your view, if there's nothing in there that precludes them from doing so?                So what -- what happens --                What happens if you get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says:                As we read the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant -- you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the same time there is nothing in there that says you may not.   And I looked at the intent of the parties and background rules, and nothing there says you may not. What do you understand to be the answer?              Can they proceed on a class basis or not?                  Yes.                  Right.    It's the background rule --                  -- under which you should interpret this.                  So we have to decide, when we -- when the contract says nothing about class actions, whether the background rule should be you can go ahead -- or the background rule should be you can't go ahead.                  Well --                  What the arbitrators have already told us -- I think you disagree with it --                  -- but take it for purposes of argument.     What the arbitrators have told us is that it doesn't say anything. It doesn't say you can do it; it doesn't say you can't do it.   Now, assume that's true.                    No, I know.   I said she doesn't agree with it. But, I mean, assuming that's true, what's the answer?   Yes or no?     Can they go ahead with class action or not?                 If you and I have a --                 I'm sorry. If you and I have a contract -- you re going to sell me a car, and we write up a contract and we enter into it, and it provides for arbitration if we have a dispute.   I also buy a car from Mr. Waxman, and I Xerox that contract.   It's the exact same contract. We have a dispute, and we go to arbitration. Can Mr. Waxman come in and say, I got the same contract, and I've got the same dispute.          Arbitrate with me, too?                 Okay.   Now, suppose I have a contract just with you and -- to arbitrate -- or I -- I have the same contract with Mr. Waxman, but it has no arbitration clause. And he says, well, the dispute is the same, you are arbitrating that, can I come in, too, and get bound by your decision?                   You would say no. And the reason is?                   Not that I -- he doesn't have any arbitration agreement with me or that it's not the same arbitration agreement?                   Let's say the intent is pertinent when we enter into the contract, okay?                    And there s good evidence about what you and I meant the contract to mean, and there s not any evidence about what Mr. Waxman and I meant the contract to mean.                 Say we ve got an arbitration clause in both cases. Can we arbitrate -- can I be required to arbitrate Mr. Waxman's contract with -- along with the one that you and I have entered into?

COAKLEY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  I suppose it would make interpretation of the act a little more difficult. The same practice would be unconscionable in -- not unconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an opinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case. And it would have to be -- the opinion would have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.                  That issue is still not settled, is it?                  We still don't know if the lawyer here was right or wrong.                  So I mean, you're -- the substance of your answer is that they are just two very different statutes.                   But I -- but I share Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in which they are different would suggest you need the legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the FDCPA.

08-1214 +++$+++             Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bonsall. ORAL EXAMINATION OF ROBERT BONSALL ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT TEAMSTERS LOCAL 287            So, if there was a contract beginning May 22nd, then that included the no-strike clause?             So -- so you don't think -- I guess this is following up on Justice Alito's question.    You don't think it included the no strike clause --             -- for -- that would apply to July 2nd?             Well, if it doesn't -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.           But if it doesn't include the no-strike clause and the question is whether the July 2nd one does, all this talk about the December agreement being retroactive to May is really kind of beside the point.             Well -- I'm sorry, but that's the central issue.           Your friend says no, we had a contract on July 2nd, and that's for the court to determine, not the arbitrator, because it's a question of formation.             And what do you expect the arbitrator to do?            The arbitrator -- since you agree that there s a contract in effect --             -- the arbitrator is not going to decide whether the contract is there or not.             And the contract has a no-strike clause.             So you expect the arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract that lets me decide something, and even though there s a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not operative on July 2nd?             Even though -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.       But even though the later agreement was that it would be retroactive?             Is that an issue for the arbitrator?     Now that we know there was an agreement on July 2nd, is the question whether the strike continued or not for the arbitrator?            Well, you say there was no strike, and I -- I thought the other side said there was.            Right.            Right, but their position is that there was a contract on July 2nd that included a no-strike clause --            -- that you violated.            Okay.    And your answer is, one, that there is no contract, right?            Oh, sure.            And that -- and that position depends upon your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that you are severing arbitration and the no-strike obligation?            Thank you, counsel.            Mr. Nussbaum. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. NUSSBAUM ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS              Not against the international?               Counsel, I'd like your broader perspective as a representative of the international, because I think it's an important issue of labor policy.    If I think that the cause of actions available under 301(a) and the pre-emptive effect of 301(a) ought to be coextensive, which -- which do you prefer, a broader 301(a) or a narrower pre-emption?              I think it makes a difference.               I think 301 -- I think whatever -- I don't think there should be a no man's land between you can bring your action under 301 and it's pre-empted by 301. In other words, if -- if you are right, that they cannot bring a tortious interference action under 301, I don't think it should be pre-empted.                If you are wrong and they can bring it, then I can understand that it should be pre-empted.            So it was pre-empted by 301, and they cannot bring it under 301?            Right.            And so if Granite Rock brought this claim in State court, you would say it's pre-empted by 301?            And then, if they turned around and brought it in Federal court under 301, you would say, no, there is no cause of action under 301?            Okay.            So it is in a no man's land.     Their claim for tortious interference with contract just can't be brought anywhere?               They could always go to the NLRB --            In State court or in Federal court?            But you bring it in Federal court?               What would the make whole -- I gather a cease-and-desist wouldn t make any sense because this is over, but what would the make whole remedy entail?              Well, but that applies in 301.   They re not touching the contract. They re not touching the parties to the contract. This is outside the contract.             So why should it be pre-empted?              I understand that.            Thank you, counsel.

What s the government's view on what a reasonable time is?                So -- but the reasonable time question doesn't come up in your -- in your hypothetical.                First because he's in the hospital and he has got a defense there, so --                But no -- but as far as a reasonable time goes, nobody's literally incapable of doing it the same day the law passed.                Unless they meet one of the other exceptions.                   What -- what do you do with Mr. Rothfeld's hypothetical about someone who travels in interstate commerce as a young child and, 20 years later, is covered by SORNA?                I'm sorry.   I'm not -- I'm missing your answer to my question.                 The answer to the child traveling and then 20 years later is --                -- is because it's -- you have to require under SORNA before the travel?                So your answer to Justice Scalia is that you don't get it from the language?    You get it from the anomaly; you get it from the purpose.                I tried to --                I tried to find one and -- and couldn't.     I mean, looking up travels in -- in the Code, and in each of those cases that I found it's always -- it looks like it's -- it's linked directly to the activity that's meant to be covered, you know, traveling for the purpose of the -- the activity that's against the law.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DIETER DAMMEIER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                   Maybe -- maybe everybody else knows this, but what is the difference between a pager and e-mail?                  You can do that with e-mails.                   The only reason -- the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad idea.   He just says these are private.                  And that allows -- and then you could look at everything else.                   You can see if he's going too far because then everything else would be there.     But in terms of -- the jury found this was not done to find out what was in the messages, so they don't need to find out what s in the messages. That's just a question.          He has to pay for everything he -- he redacts.                  I mean, it's no different than the police coming in and saying, well, we re going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't -- it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is Justice Kennedy's point.           It's kind of the plain view doctrine, except they get to decide how broad what they can view is.                  What happens, just out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and sending a message and they re trying to reach him for, you know, a SWAT team crisis?             Does he -- does the one kind of trump the other, or do they get a busy signal?                  And would you know where the message was coming from?                  Well --                   Well, again, it depends upon their reasonable expectation.                 Do any of these other people know about Arch Wireless?                  Don't they just assume that once they send something to Quon, it's going to Quon?                   Well, then they can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on the fact that their communication is routed through a communications company.                    Well, I didn't -- I wouldn't think that.        I thought, you know, you push a button; it goes right to the other thing. (Laughter.)                  But just -- just to be clear:   You think if these messages went straight to Quon that there d be no problem from the point of view of the senders?      I mean, no problem in searching -- getting them from Quon?                  Yes.                  So we have to assume for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes somewhere else and then it s processed and then it goes to Quon.                  Thank you, counsel.

GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                 Well, then why do you have --                 Why do you have a policy, a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says anything about all-comers.           You ve got a written policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.                  Well, then why is --                  Is this nondiscrimination policy no longer on the books?                   Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't say that.                   Right.                   So they -- so you re saying the second paragraph is totally unnecessary.     You say the first paragraph says you can't discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph spells out the bases.          So why do you do have the second paragraph?                   Well, they -- they quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild, which says any member must  agree with the objectives of the organization as set forth herein.                    That's not all-comers.    That's a bylaw that restricts an organization according to its -- members can't join unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in objectives of the organization.                   It has nothing to do with --                   It's got nothing to do with sexual -- well, I don't know the National Lawyers Guild, but they say you have got to agree with the objectives of the organization.                  No, start with mine.                  It seems to me that your position is continually evolving wherever the First Amendment pressure comes.          You ve got a written nondiscrimination policy.          And then you say, well, yes, but we use an all-comers policy.               You ve got an all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to that.   It seems to me that we should go with -- why shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written bylaws?                  No, you re talking about --                  -- La Raza background. As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the organization.                    So if you have a law that says every newspaper that s published in the United States must be reviewed every day by the government's censor board, and the fact that the government's censor board decides not to do it, then that law is okay?                  A newspaper sues saying that law is constitutional, and we ll say it's all right; it has never been applied?                  That was because they might adopt a different policy.                  We re not dealing with a future different policy in this case.                  That's not going to help if you have the 50 anti-Muslim students who want to take over the group.                  Okay.   They take over the group and the first thing they do is say we re abolishing the attendance policy. (Laughter.)                   I m sorry.      I don t understand your --                  Well, but that's because gender or race is fundamentally different from religious brief.   Gender and race is a status.                   Religious belief -- it has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are not open to everybody.         We have beliefs, you have to subscribe to them.      And we ve always regarded that as a good thing.   That type of exclusion is supported in -- in the Constitution.        The other types of exclusion are not.                    You phrase it that way.   It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious group, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude people who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs.                  Well, that -- that -- that's pretty tough.              That has no connection to merit.     I assume there are groups that think subscribing to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly religious groups.     So, how can you have a -- a test that allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not beliefs?                  Well, I'm sorry.   All parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers policy.   Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy was the written nondiscrimination policy.                   In your response to Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your position that California law requires religious groups to admit people who do not believe in their religious beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group?                   So the answer to my question is "yes"?                   Thank you, Mr. Garre.

It seems -- it seems -- I'm being flip.          It seems that that's where you would focus your attention, if you think your community has essentially been fleeced by somebody because of his dishonesty.                 But if -- if you re going to say that the statute refers to a term of art, the whole point of a term of art is that it s a shorthand for defining something.       And then -- but if you re saying that it's a term of art that means the pre-MCNally case law over the -- you know, all the different circuits and the district courts and that some knowledge of that, it -- it's descriptive of something, but it's not a term of art.                 No, I'm with you there.   But then the kinds of cases -- that's where it gets fuzzy.    I mean, you need lawyers and research before you get an idea of what the pre-MCNally state of law was with respect to intangible -- the right to intangible services, of honest services.                 And I m just wondering how clear does what that body of law is have to be before you can say, you know what, when we tell you that right, you know that that's what it's referring to?                It kind of -- it puts the prospective defendant, I guess, in an awfully difficult position, though, if he has got to wait. There s this common law evolution over time.                 You have two cases the government wins, one it loses, three -- and he's supposed to keep track of that.                 That doesn't sound like fair notice of what's criminal.           So that covers the case that your friend put of the employee using the computer for personal use?        That fits under this instruction?
08-1402 +++$+++             Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lawrence.            If you had a community with one African-American, your argument would be the same, if that's the disparity?            That means every -- every minority is left off the jury.            I guess I'm -- I guess I m echoing Justice Stevens s question of whether or not this type of statistical analysis really works when you re dealing with relatively small numbers.            Do I understand your siphoning theory to depend upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number of jurors from the pool?            That results in fewer minorities going up to the county court, right?            Removed from the county --            Where -- where in the record is it established that Grand Rapids had a disproportionate need for jurors from the pool?            Well, if it's -- if your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing a disproportionate number and it is not in the record that Grand Rapids drew a disproportionate number, I think that means you lose.               Of course.   Of course, but we have to look at this on a proportional basis, right?   Grand Rapids is also sending a higher number of jurors to the pool than -- than the small rural county.               Your -- your theory depends upon Grand Rapids drawing not just a proportional number, if it's contributing 30 percent and it draws 30 percent; your theory depends upon Grand Rapids contributing 30 percent to the pool and drawing 40 percent.              How is that?     Don't those people then have to become professional jurors? They have to serve on every jury, or you re going to have the disproportion that the statistics show.             Your answer to Justice Scalia's question is -- is no, right?             Because the idea is, if Grand Rapids sends up a pool that s 30 percent minority and if it takes back the same number as everybody else, it's going to get -- the county is going to get the same proportion. It's only when they take back more.             They have the more heavily African-American pool, and they are going to draw from it more than everybody else is drawing from theirs, so there will be fewer African- Americans to go to the county.              But you have no evidence that Grand Rapids takes back more than its share, proportionally, than anybody else.              At the county level?              Yes.   Was there any evidence that your venire -- that minorities were underrepresented on your venire?             Where is that in the record?             Help me --             Help me -- help me with the math.   If there were one more African- American, what would the percentage be?           Pretty close to what you re saying it should be, right?            Thank you, counsel.

08-1448 +++$+++        Mr. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       What about -- the distinction between books and movies may be that, in these video games, the child is not sitting there passively watching something; the child is doing the killing.     The child is doing the maiming.     And I suppose that might be understood to have a different impact on the child's moral development.       What was -- what was the state of the record that was present before the Court in Ginsberg?       So the Court acted on the basis of common sense?       I don't want to interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass parental controls in about 5 minutes.       Graphic violence. There is a difference.     We do not have a tradition in this country of telling children they should watch people actively hitting schoolgirls over the head with a shovel so they'll beg with mercy, being merciless and decapitating them, shooting people in the leg so they fall down -- I'm reading from the district court description -- pour gasoline over them, set them on fire, and urinate on them.     We do not have a tradition in this country.     We protect children from that.     We don't actively expose them to that.       Is it your position -- I know this is a facial challenge, Mr. Smith.     So is it your position that the First Amendment could not prohibit the sale to minors of the video game that I just described?       I know you don't, but what is -- you're avoiding the answer.     Does the First Amendment protect the sale of that video to minors?       A minor?       So your position is that the First Amendment does not, cannot, no matter what type of law, whether this one is vague or not, that the State legislature cannot pass a law that says you may not sell to a 10-year-old a video in which they set schoolgirls on fire.       Mr. Smith, your - your challenge is a facial challenge?       So that under - whether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test, if there is either one or any applications that would satisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails. Right?       I thought we referenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the only reason we didn't have to decide which applies is because we adopted an approach that looked at overbreadth and said this statute is overbroad and specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied in that case to -- to crush videos.       Well, I understood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I think, is that there may be games and may be minors - maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps that violates the First Amendment, but something like Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that.       And the way we approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down, it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a more narrowly drawn statute might pass muster. Why -- why isn't that a good approach here?       So, just to be clear, your answer to Justice Alito is, at this point, there is nothing the State can do?       Could I -- could I just have a simple answer?       There's nothing the State can do.       Could you have a law that says the State has to put -- the dealers have to put the violent video games in a particular area of the video store?       That is not -- and then -- you know, and minors are not allowed in that area.       Yes.       So they can't say, example, all the -- all the highest rated videos have to be on the top shelf out of the reach of children.     Can they do that?       That's what they do with cigarettes or something, isn't it?       Cigarettes are something that we have determined are harmful to children.     The question is, you say the record doesn't support the idea that these video games are harmful to children.     Some of us may conclude that it does.       We draw that kind of line of course in the death penalty area, don't we? Between 18-year-olds?     You are under 18; you can't be sentenced to life without parole; if you were over 18, you can.       And we do it for drinking; we do it for driving.
08-1457 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    So, counsel, if I -                   No, go ahead; finish.                   Let -- let's say the board delegates to a group the authority to act as the board until December 31st, 2010.                  And on December 30th, 2010, the group delegates to itself because it's acting as the board the authority to act until December 31, 2011.     Is that valid?                    All the powers of the board until December 31st.                   So a delegee can delegate to itself the full authority of the -- the master in the master -agent relationship?                   No, no; they are just -- you know, they make the distinction that the board should continue to function.                   Even though their original delegation was limited to 2010 -                   -- they, acting as a board, get to delegate to themselves as the group the authority to go beyond that.                   Now, what if the board, consisting of five members -- let's say three Democrats and two Republicans -- the three Democrats delegate to a group the authority to act as a board. They designate themselves as the members of the group. They have at that point, authorized themselves to act as the board with as little as two members, even though they couldn't have done that as members of the board.                      Even though the whole -- even though the whole purpose of expanding from three to five was to ensure that more than two are required for the board to act?                      Not trying to, but succeeding in doing so.                      Well, I mean, it depends upon who would remove them for cause.                   Now, who would remove them?                   Well, what if he's perfectly content to have two Democrats?                     I just want to make sure there is nothing to constrain -- if you have three Democrats, three -- or two Republicans or, of course, the other way around, nothing to constrain them from acting fully as the board with only two -- two Democrats?                     In the statute.                    What actually happens on -- on the ground?             Somebody complains about an unfair labor practice to the board, and let's say the petitioner prevails and the board can't function.                     What happens next?    Is there -- I don't know if there would be a review or not, but can you go to the court of appeals?                    Yes, assume there is no board.   As you say, the -- the problem that would happen if you don't prevail?                     And the recess appointment power doesn't work why?

08-1470 +++$+++                  Thank you, Ms. Saharsky. Ms. Jacobs. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                What happens when you read Butler?                   Well, we have it to the extent that he was told he had right to remain silent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you.                   Is it there any clearly established law the other way, which is the pertinent question?                  We re not talking -- we re not talking about the Fifth Amendment right. We re talking about the Miranda warnings.                 There s no issue of voluntariness in this case.                 Right?                  There s no suggestion that there s -- that the statements are not voluntary.   The suggestion is that they may have violated Miranda.                What if he said, do you want to remain silent?                And he doesn't answer either one.                You say you don't have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that you can impliedly waive them.           You don't have to expressly waive them.                Right.   So the question under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an implied waiver; that's what Butler says, right?               So the question under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable to determine that there was an implied waiver on these facts?                Yes.                Maybe.                Right.                What are those?                 And all he has to do is say:    I don't want to talk to you.               It's over.                 I don't understand how they create the ambiguity.             Well, I guess this gets back to a question I had earlier.              I thought there was no dispute on this record that there was no involuntariness.   We are talking about a violation of the technical, important but formal, Miranda requirements.   This is not a case where the person says: My statements were involuntary.             But that's correct -- and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at the circumstances.   And you re saying no, you don't look at any circumstances; they have got to ask the question and he has to waive.                  The other circumstances are irrelevant. Well then, if yes, why are you talking to me about 2 hours 15 minutes, what they are doing?                You say that circumstances don't matter.                  That issue is not in this case, though.                  As I understand it, you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have not renewed that, correct?         This is a Miranda case; it's not a Fifth Amendment case.                One?   I mean, that's -- I don't want to piggyback off Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say. Before they can say anything more, they have to get a waiver.   So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how long do they have to ask, do you want to waive?                Could -- could you describe a situation where you think there would be an implied waiver?                Well, I thought that -- that doesn't sound implied.               That sounds express to me.                So, is --                Okay.   So what -- what is an implied waiver case?                  Well, that's right. Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if you prevail, you have to overrule Butler.                And it seems to me that that's the point we're at.                  So, there's -- so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right to remain silent?                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Restuccia, you have 4 minutes remaining.

General, you've talked about -- there has been a lot of discussion about the legitimate activities allowing -- facilitating illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all that, and legitimizing the group. Is that an argument you've made before this Court or below?   I looked at your briefs, and I thought it's almost all about:     This is O'Brien, this is conduct, this is not speech.            I didn't see the argument that we've spent a lot of time talking about, which is the legitimate activities allow the illegitimate activities to take place.                 Do you have -- I don't mean to -- do you have particular references to where in your brief you made the argument?                Yes, I know.   It seems to me your case is all about O'Brien.               I'm not sure you have an answer to whether or not strict scrutiny is satisfied.    If we disagree with you and think that some of this activity is speech, I don't see the argument that you've presented on strict scrutiny.                I'm sorry.     You can communicate on -- I don't mean to interrupt.                    But you can communicate on your own, but you can't communicate with them?             Oh, okay.                   Well, but that s -- I'm not -- I'm not sure that's right.              I mean, expert advice or assistance -- I don't know sitting down that I could tell, you know, how to advocate for peaceful, you know, resolution or whatever.       Is that expert advice?            Is that specialized knowledge?       And I understand training, service, personnel, but that one's a little hard to --                   No, my -- my point is that this --                   Yes.   My point is that even knowing what they intend to do, it's kind of hard to decide whether that's based on specialized knowledge or not.
08-1521 +++$+++                 Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Feldman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Well, I think that's exactly -- that's exactly right.             And that is what the Court elaborated on in Duncan.            I do think the focus is our system of ordered liberty, not any abstract system of ordered liberty.     You can say Japan is a free country, but it doesn't have the right to trial by -- by jury. The -- the concept only makes sense, I think, if you limit it to our system.                 Under our system, as you said, the -- the right to a jury is essential.                  Well, if you think that's right, why wouldn't you think, for all the reasons given in Heller, that the Second Amendment right is essential to our system, whatever it may be with respect to France or England or anywhere else?                I don't see how you can read --                I don't see how you can read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the Second Amendment, whether you d want to label it fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers in their view of what liberty meant.                Well, sure, and it's still going to be subject to the political process if the Court determines that it s incorporated in the Due Process Clause.     All the arguments you make against incorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should make in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment. We haven't said anything about what the content of the Second Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.                And so the argument you make is, well, given this context, you should not be able to have concealed carry.            Well, maybe that's right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of regulation.                That sounds an awful lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the losing side.                Well, to get back to Justice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered, is your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of is it in or is it out?      But you re saying, well, what is in and what is out, are you?                  So you think it's in or out, right?                  No, I -- I know your reasons.                  I'm trying to get you to take a position on whether or not you want us to not only pick and choose among which amendments are part of our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you want us also to take amendments that might be in and refine them and shave them off a little bit and say, well, this part of the amendment is in, and this part isn't.                  Okay.   So your argument is all in or all out.                Okay.                That's how you think Madison went about his job? (Laughter.)                I'm asking counsel. Do you think that's how Madison went about his job?                Well, all those may be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court incorporates the Second Amendment.               Incorporation doesn't say anything by itself about whether those types of regulations, which you think are reasonable and your friends think may not be reasonable, are valid or not.                I'm sorry.   Is it the position of the City of Chicago that we should rely on Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold?                Well, then your answer to Justice Stevens is no, you re not going to follow that approach, right?

Oh, so you re saying -- your response to Justice Stevens follows because you say they -- unless they say a Bivens action is excluded, it's not.

FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Counsel, you don t --                  But part of your argument -- you don't rely heavily on your plain language argument when it comes to deciding that these huge ocean vessels are rail carriers.                So that's a little bit different from your argument that they are a rail carrier because their bill of lading would cover the train ride to Chicago.                If it weren't -- if it weren't for the -- for the track from Long Beach to Los Angeles, you would say then they re not a rail carrier?                Well, unless we hold, as your friends argue on the other side, that they can opt out under 10709.                And that's a different question with respect to liability and claims and with respect to venue.             Perhaps --                 Maybe now you could respond to my question about the distinction under 10502 between claims and liability and venue.                Well, but it's a little -- I mean, the -- I m looking at page 64a of the petition appendix, where they re saying you can't exempt through contractual terms for liability and claims. Venue is treated elsewhere, separately from liability and claims.   So, again, under -- you re the plain language team, and that seems fairly plain that venue is not covered.                No, the liability is not where you can bring your suit.               Liability is liability.   Venue is where you can bring your suit.                Is that because they have contracted for them?                Well, they don't own Union Pacific's rail line.                 So if I -- if I own a container being pulled by somebody else's train, I'm in the train business?                 No, it wouldn't.   It would just -- it may just mean that they don't have the regulatory authority because that container is a rail carrier.             What s carrying it is the rail carrier.     It's a container.                Well, they -- they can't contract around liability for an event such as the one that happened here.       Because they have to offer Carmack-compliant terms, and if the owner of the goods has the option of accepting those, they can't contract around that.
08-1555 +++$+++                  Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                But the state -- there is -- the distinction strikes me as artificial as well.     We re talking about insulating state acts.              The only way a state can act is through people.                 And you re saying:     Well, the state is insulated, but the people who do the acts for the state are not.                 I don't see how that can -- can work.                Oh, well, then -- but the whole point of the Act was to codify what was there before, and -- and it seems odd to say, well, they were codifying the immunity of the state, but not the immunity of the only way a state can act, which is through individuals.                  Ms. Millett, I thought --   I thought the whole point of the FSIA was to get the Executive Branch out of the business of sending letters to the court every time a state was sued.              The government requested it for that purpose.     Now they are just back into it again if you say, well, you can just sue the individuals. And the government's position in this case confirms that.     They're -- they tell us the way you should proceed is to look to the Executive Branch and, basically, we ll send you a letter and let you know. So it seems to me the whole reason you have the FSIA is undermined by the position you re taking today.                 Courts -- courts decide this sort of question all the time, whether you re talking about principles of domestic immunity or even corporate liability:             Is the employee on a frolic or is it a detour?        Determining when an individual is acting for another entity as opposed to on -- on his own business, that's a very common inquiry.                Your friend -- you friend --                Your friend said it happens all the time.      He cited the example of the Israeli embassy is always sending letters or showing up in court when their agents are -- are sued.                 Please.                Finish your sentence.                You made that a long sentence. (Laughter.)               Thank you, counsel.               Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                  I wonder -- I wonder if the example you give or the point you make, that there s no functioning Somali Government, doesn't cut the other way. Let's assume you have somebody who was acting in an official capacity, doing what his job required, whether you like it or not, and then there s a change in the Somali government; and the United States likes the new Somali government.            That guy is kind of put out to -- to dry because he can't get anybody to say what he maintains is true, which was I was acting pursuant to official policy of the government.                And the United States is not going to give him the letter he needs because they like the new Somali government.                 Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

Well, the Court's -- the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted that it wasn't addressing this statute.                I think it's a little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well, Castillo decides this case.

08-205 +++$+++                      Thank you, Mr. Abrams. General Kagan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELENA KAGAN ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE                 So you are giving up -- you are giving up the distinction from MCFL that you defended in your opening brief?               There you said this doesn't qualify as a different kind of corporation because it takes corporate funds, and now you are changing that position?                 So I guess -- do you think MCFL applies in this case even though the corporation takes corporate funds from for-profit corporations?                  Do you -- do you think it's too strict?                  So you want to give up this case, change your position, and basically say you lose solely because of the questioning that we have directed on reargument?                  Because of the question we have posed on reargument.                  What case of ours -- what case of ours suggests that there is a hierarchy of bases on which we should rule against a party when both of them involve constitutional questions?                     Extending -- modifying MCFL would be, I assume, by virtue of the First Amendment.     Overruling Austin would be by virtue of the First Amendment.         So what case says we should prefer one as opposed to the other?                 Counsel, what do you -- what do you understand to be the compelling interest that the Court articulated in Austin?                 Right.     So but you -- you have more or less -- "abandoned" is too strong a word, but as you say you have relied on a different interest, the quid pro quo corruption.                  And you -- you articulate on page 11 of your brief -- you recognize that this Court has not accepted that interest as a compelling interest. So isn't it the case that as you view Austin it is kind of up for play in the sense that you would ground it on an interest that the Court has never recognized?                 Where --                 Where in your -- where in your supplemental briefing do you say that this aggregation of wealth interest supports Austin?                    Putting it outside, putting the quid pro quo interest aside, where in your supplemental briefing do you support the interest that was articulated by the Court in Austin?                    I understand that to be a different interest.         That is the shareholder protection interest as opposed to the fact that corporations have such wealth and they -- they distort the marketplace.                    So -- so am I right then in saying that in the supplemental briefing you do not rely at all on the market distortion rationale on which Austin relied; not the shareholder rationale, not the quid pro quo rationale, the market distortion issue. These corporations have a lot of money.                  So if we have to preserve -- if we are going to preserve Austin we have to accept your invitation that the quid pro quo interest supports the holding there or the shareholder protection interest.                 Well, that's not -- I'm sorry, but that seems rather odd.                   A large corporation just like an individual has many diverse interests.    A corporation may want to support a particular candidate, but they may be concerned just as you say about what their shareholders are going to think about that.    They may be concerned that the shareholders would rather they spend their money doing something else.   The idea that corporations are different than individuals in that respect, I just don't think holds up.                 So if a candidate -- take a tobacco company, and a candidate is running on the platform that they ought to make tobacco illegal, presumably that company would maximize its shareholders' interests by opposing the election of that individual.                 Well, I suppose some do, but let's say if you have ten individuals and they each contribute $1,000 to a corporation, and they say, "we want this corporation to convey a particular message," why can't they do that, when if they did that as partnership, it would be all right?                  Counsel, could I ask, it seems -- to your shareholder protection rationale, isn't it extraordinarily paternalistic for the government to take the position that shareholders are too stupid to keep track of what their corporations are doing and can't sell their shares or object in the corporate context if they don't like it?                   You have a busy job. You can't expect everybody to do that. (Laughter.)                   But it is extraordinary -- I mean, the -- the idea and as I understand the rationale, we -- we the government, big brother, has to protect shareholders from themselves. They might give money, they might buy shares in a corporation and they don't know that the corporation is taking out radio ads.       The government has to keep an eye on their interests.                    So it is -- I mean, I understand.   So it is a paternalistic interest, we the government have to protect you naive shareholders.                    It's not investing in our country's --                    I take it we have never accepted your shareholder protection interest. This is a new argument.                    Well, I guess other than that, and I think there may be some ambiguity there, but I wouldn't say NRWC is a holding on shareholder protection.        So to the extent that you abandoned the original rationale in Austin, and articulated different rationales, you have two, the quid pro quo corruption interest and the shareholder protection interest --                    Austin, I thought, was based on the aggregation of immense wealth by corporations.                    Can you -- can you give me the citation to the page in Austin where we accepted the shareholder protection rationale?                   Do the words "shareholder" -- I don't know, do the words "shareholder protection" appear in the Austin opinion?                   If they don't -- let's assume they don't, then I get back to my question, which is, you are asking us to defend the Austin or support or continue the Austin opinion on the basis of two rationales that we have never accepted, shareholder protection and quid pro quo corruption?                   In the context of contributions, not expenditures.                 Is that a yes?   Is that a yes?    In other words, you are asking us to uphold Austin on the basis of two arguments, two principles, two compelling interests we have never accepted, in expenditure context.                  But we don't put our -- we don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands of FEC bureaucrats; and if you say that you are not going to apply it to a book, what about a pamphlet?                  Does cover books.                  Oh, I'm sorry, we suggested some in the last argument.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF SENATORS JOHN MCCAIN, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLEE                  One of the amicus briefs, I'm not -- maybe it's professor Hayward, if I am getting that right -- suggested the history of this 1947 provision was such that it really wasn't enforced because people were concerned about the First Amendment interests and that the courts to the extent cases were brought did everything they could to avoid enforcing the limitations.                  Well, Mr. Waxman, the government did have that opportunity, and the government compiled a record.            And when the Citizens United abandoned that position -- you are quite right, they changed their course -- the government and the district court complained that it had to go to all this work to develop this record, and yet we hear nothing about what the record showed.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    What is the pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages -- awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?                    I am -- what -- which --any case from this Court?                    All right.                    Well, if -- if the -- if the existence of the punitive damages and maintenance and cure were as well established, why wasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority? It only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.                     I'm not sure as sure -- I'm not sure I follow that.                       In other areas where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in the cases going away.        Quite the opposite.                 It seems that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both sides.                     Yeah, but the normal medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of punitive damage litigation.              I don't know why this would anybody different.                    Well, I mean, it -- whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is still a significant and will give rise to greater costs on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.                    No, no, even if they're not.     In other words, you were saying, look, to avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make sure that there -- that that more expensive test is provided.                    That doesn't mean there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.                  Thank you, counsel.

08-267 +++$+++                       Mr. Freedus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW S. FREEDUS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   What -- which case of ours establishes the proposition that there always has to be an available avenue of relief?                    Well, that's different than saying there always has to be available relief.    That's saying you think Congress usually intends there to be available relief.                     And that would be a doubtful assumption here, given the rather clear expressions of finality that -- that are -- that are in the UCMJ statutes.                    You don't -- you don't think there's authority for the proposition they can do it?                    I'm looking for authority that says they can't do it.                  I'm sorry --                  I don't like it very much. But what is -- your argument is that the Constitution does not require that this person have, right now, an available avenue of relief, your position?                  So then it comes, as Justice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not we should read the statutes here in a particular way to avoid confronting that question?                   Well, but the collateral consequences of the conviction are pretty dramatic.    In this case they decide whether the guy stays in the country or is deported.                   Well, so I think Justice Breyer's question is still on the table.                     Why would Congress intend to afford greater relief and remedies to somebody who's outside -- was within the military system and is now outside, than to an ordinary civilian under Article III jurisdiction?                  Within -- within the military system?                  All within the system.   I mean, the difference with this case is that you're talking about somebody who is, I guess that's the issue, out of the military system. The problem with your position is that it would dramatically expand the jurisdiction of the military system.    It would sort of follow everybody they've dealt with around for their life, right?                     At any time somebody who is out of the military system, whose judgment is supposedly final under the provisions that Congress has established, he could come back and knock on the door 20 years later and say, I want to review my conviction.                     And he would be within the military system.                     Right.                     And he's back in the military system, 20 years later.                   For someone still within the military system?                   So the answer --                   -- to Justice Ginsburg is that we have never held that with respect to a situation like the facts here, where you're dealing with somebody who is outside -- long departed from the military system?                   This is -- this is at a hearing.    This isn't a Member of Congress, obviously, that we're talking about.                      It's not even a single Member of Congress?                   Under the specific --                   Under the specific provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by very strict finality provisions. There's no suggestion in his testimony that the availability of the relief that he's talking about continues after the individual is outside the military system.   He's channeling -- he says these are channeled through a specific provision applicable only within the military system.                   I'm sorry.   I've had the chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and like Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in there that the relief he's talking about continues after someone is out of the service.                   Well, a final judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts within -- in the military system, just like you have -- a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review in our system.                   Well, you have review in the appellate system.                Someone is -- the judgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek review.    Are they discharged while the review is going on?                   You -- you don't think that if you prevail in this case, we're going to see a lot more coram nobis petitions than we did before?                     Thank you, counsel.
08-289 +++$+++                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                      But I guess, as I understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order is based on funding a particular plan and the State comes back and says, this is a new approach.                   It could be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know, the plan is not working, or there have been other budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can afford to spend on this particular program.                   Here's another plan.   The funding levels are different.                  You should look at it.                      What's wrong with that?                   It's not a question of progress; it's a question of the plan and the approach.     And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific funding that was based on the prior order.                   And what I understood the State's submission to be -- look at what the superintendent has done in this particular case, and so on, so that those specific funding levels aren't applicable.    And I would have thought it an extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell a State legislature:        Pass this budget, and you, Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor, sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance.                  And if they've come up with a different way with different funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a changed circumstance that justifies looking at the judgment --                    Well, I don't think the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree that there's still work to be done.                     I thought that the plan -- the point was that their approach had changed, including by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have to reach the same specific funding levels that the district court order required.              And what I understood the Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding levels are still in place.                    Is there any --                    Does -- then does that stay true without regard to what is happening economically to the State?          In other words, the district court can say:   You've got to spend this much money on this program, and I don't care what it means for jails, roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's experiencing lately.                   But I gather it's often the case in institutional litigation of this sort that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look, we should spend more money on this.                     So they go to the district court judge and say, make us spend more money on this.   And they get the same result they'd wanted in a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General does. So why should we put a lot of weight on what the representation is when we are at least concerned that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?                   Well, it's hard for the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't have a choice.                   Can I ask just a question that was confusing to me?                What standard for changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth Circuit to have applied?                   Which is?                   I am looking at page 72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they use there is radically changed, not significantly changed.                   So, if we have a -- if we are confused as to which standard they applied, because at one point they say significantly changed and at another point they say radically changed, what should we do?                   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY OF BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                   Counsel, when you were starting out I heard you articulate a third standard, materially changed.             What is your understanding of the standard applied by the Ninth Circuit?   Was it materially changed, significantly changed or radically changed?                   Well, I don't either but I see both of them being different from radically changed.                   I still have trouble with the idea of district courts ordering State legislatures to fund it.          Isn't the preferable approach for the district court to say you have a violation, you have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed it at particular intervals?             And it's up to you, the State, to determine how you are going to fix it. And the State might change its mind.                 They may start out by saying we have got all of this extra money and that's how we will fix it.                    Then there is a budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some other way, and here's the way. But that's kind of the judgment of the State, not for the district court.                   Why does it order then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the termination of the legislative session, and say you have 12 days left in the session and that's how many days you have to enact this budget?

If the bankruptcy court made a mistake and purported to exercise jurisdiction over your claims, then I suppose you have, in particular cases if you can establish it, a due process claim that fully protects you.

I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are asking the school district to incur, that will take away funds from other programs.            And all -- all they are saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't work out, then you can go?                     Oh, yes, the first day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we are going to do.    And they say, well, you've got to do that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.                    Well, I suppose that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be able -- they would understand as well, and they would understand you've got to -- the people who are going to be sending -- most of the people who will be sending their children to the school have to wait ten days.                   And it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground would work out pretty easily.                   Well, which way does that cut?   It seems to me that cuts the other way.                   Here's a -- here's a new plan.   We've worked on it.             Here it is.     At least give it ten days -- two school week tries.                   With respect, counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must have previously received special education and related services.                   So I think they did provide that you've got to try it out at least for a minimal period.                   Okay.   So what type of special education services do you think do count as having been previously received?                   In reading -- in reading it that way, you are reading the phrase "who previously received special education services" to mean also who previously did not receive special education services.                   Yeah, so it doesn't matter whether they previously received or not.                   So you are saying Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the other things, but that was not the universe of the situations in which there could be reimbursement?                 They went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to say or some other provisions or some other circumstances?                     Thank you, counsel.                     Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT                  Well, for 10 days, right?   Even assuming the bad faith that you are ascribing to the school district, it would only work for 10 days, right?                  And then they would have -- then they would have previously received special education services, and they could proceed.                  "Stonewall" sounds to me like bad faith.                  That was the word you used.                     Well, let's move to the situation where they have a plan that the parents regard as inadequate.                     In that situation all they would have to do is to have the child try the plan for 10 days.                   Counsel, this is Spending Clause legislation.            Do you have any rough idea of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is reimbursed by the Federal Government?                   What percentage?                   So if this interpretation vastly expands the liability of school districts in that particular area, isn't that a consideration we should consider?                Since they accept -- the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that a pertinent factor?                      Thank you, counsel.

Well, putting aside what the Court has said, I'm looking at what the Framers have said.   What good does a tonnage tax prohibition do --                  -- if you are right?
08-322 +++$+++                      Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE HOLDER                  Counsel, the -- the -- our -- our decision in City of Boerne said that action under section 5 has to be congruent and proportional to what it's trying to remedy.                 Here, as I understand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the submissions are not precleared.              That, to me, suggests that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need to, to address the intentional discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment.                  Well, that's like the old -- you know, it's the elephant whistle.                  You know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants. You know, well, that's silly.              Well, there are no elephants, so it must work. I mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too broadly.                  Well, let me focus on that historical aspect.         Obviously no one doubts the history here and that the history was different.               But at what point does that history seek -- stop justifying action with respect to some jurisdictions but not with respect to others that show greater disparities?                  Well, so your answer is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment forever because of the history in the south?                  When can they -- when can they -- when do they have to stop?                  Well, they said five years originally and then another 20 years.               I mean, at some point it begins to look like the idea is that this is going to go on forever.                 Well, why didn't Congress then extend the Act to Massachusetts, whereas your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions that are covered?                    Counsel, I thought -- I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the problem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be widespread and persisting.           Do you think the record that is before us today shows widespread and persisting discrimination in voting?                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Adegbile. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBO P. ADEGBILE ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENOR-APPELLEES                 So is it your -- is it your position that today southerners are more likely to discriminate than northerners?                     So your answer is yes?                     So -- but I guess that point depends upon the assumption that shortening the time period for early voting is discriminatory as opposed to good policy.                  So that was largely to protect the incumbent.                  Well, incumbent --                  Incumbent protection takes place in the North as well as the South.                  Well, the cases you're talking about include both intentional and impact cases.   And the Constitution that section 5 is designed to implement covers only intentional discrimination.                       So even the examples you have given sweep broadly as a prophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance of course sweeps even more broadly.                     So we do have a situation, despite the evidence that was -- that you have cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent of the submissions that the States make are denied preclearance. Again, it seems to me that that means that section 5 sweeps very, very broadly.                   So your position is that it makes no difference if discrimination in the noncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more persistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can focus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965?                  So I guess your answer is that they can address the covered jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without looking at all to the rest of the country?                  Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS PETERS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                 Well, but then if it's -- if it's money that is being conditionally released, there s no security for the government.                 If it turns out later on it shouldn't have been released, it's probably gone.                 What if -- what if at your innocent owner or the hearing that you are seeking, you establish, well, I was going to sell my baseball card to give me the money to -- to survive, to get food? That was my -- I mean, what happens then?                 So just to get back to the cars, I thought your answer to Justice Alito was a little abstract.    In the absolute concrete case, where the drug -- the suspect is driving the car, there are drugs in the car.                  At your hearing, the -- it's not registered to him.           The registered owner comes in and says, that's my car, I had no idea it was being used for drugs. Who wins, the State or the registered owner?                  Well, aren't they always going to say that?        They are going to say, well, we don't know if the registered owner is involved in the drug conspiracy.    We don't know how closely he is tied with the owner, so it's reasonable to assume he knew what was going on, and besides, we ve got a lot of other bigger fish to fry during this period. We are trying to find out the scope of the conspiracy.   We are trying to find out where the sales were going to take place.         Why do you force us to -- to focus our energies on the relationship between a registered owner and the guy driving the car?                 So it s as -- so it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a little bit to the mootness question that we began with. Because it focuses on the circumstances of the individual claimants, and if the individual claimants have already had their property returned, I think it accentuates the mootness issue.                  Well, that's an interesting -- that's an interesting question.                I mean, is it becoming moot through their voluntary cessation or activity when the State law requires them to take particular action?                  Thank you, counsel.

You have two people making a decision; one says it's because of age and the one says it's because of something, and -- a legitimate factor -- and you acknowledge that could get to the jury?                    And is it under an instruction that simply says "because of"?                    Well, but I mean -- you say --                   You say "but for" causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the alleged action, would not have happened but for one factor or the other if they are just two different factors.   You would just leave that up to the jury to say because of?

ELIASBERG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 So that under your approach that this is looking to see if the injunction is being enforced or violated, we would be reviewing an act of Congress under an abuse of discretion standard, not -- not de novo?                    Have we ever done that before?                    Have we ever said that an act of Congress is unconstitutional without a de novo review of the merits of the constitutionality?                  So when you get to the consistent with the injunction part -- I thought it was your position that we should review this question solely under an abuse of discretion standard?                  Because while the Court did not decide the validity of the act in the first case, it certainly did in the second case, which is why we have the case before us.                    Counsel, if -- if -- if the government sold this land to a private party, no cross in the picture at all, and they go to settlement and at settlement the private landowner who is going to buy it says, you know, I'm going to put a big cross up on this property once I get it, can the government still sell it to him?                    Okay.                    So even though before the sale, even though the government knows there is going to be a big cross on the land with the same situation you have here in the middle of the preserve and all, that's perfectly okay?                  I thought you said before the government sold the land if they find out the new owner is going to put a cross on it there is no problem.                  Do you disagree with what she told us, which is that the private property owner can tear down the cross at any time?                  You say under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.               Does that -- do you just mean they have authority to regulate the land?                  Well, I suppose they have jurisdiction to regulate a lot of -- lot of land that they don't own.                  What else -- what else does the plaque say.                  And that's it? Nothing else?                 Can I get back to your plaque question?       Am I wrong?            I think the government told us the plaque reads:                    "The cross erected in memory the dead of all wars, erected 1934 by members of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884."                 That's a big difference.    I mean, the whole point is that the plaque tells you, this is not a government memorial, government structure.    It was put up by members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Death Valley Post 2884.                 The context of my question was what does the plaque say?                 All right.                  Counsel, this probably doesn't have anything to do with anything, but I'm just kind of curious, why is this cross put up -- you know, in the middle of nowhere? (Laughter. )

Can we take that off the table? I mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth Circuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet you say the rule is so clearly established that you can make these school officials personally liable.                     What if --                     What if what Marissa has is heroin?   The school administrator recognizes heroin.   She says:      This is what the student gave me? Search the undergarments or not?                   Just to combine it with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are saying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for justifying the preliminary search is that the student has heroin?                   Well, you've made that point several times.           In fact the issue here covers the brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish as the underpants, right? Did you say the prisoner?  Well, yes, in                    Maybe I'm -- maybe I'm not articulating this.             You keep focusing on the fact that it's unlikely that the pills would be concealed in her underpants.               That doesn't go to the brassiere at all.
08-495 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Well, but then you just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll have a little debate about what the special interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation.                   Mr. Gannon, we're dealing with the definition of a particular term, aggravated felony.      And yet you say the only thing that you have to prove under the protections of criminal law to prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it involved fraud or deceit.          Now, the other elements -- the other provisions here talk about firearms offenses, child pornography offenses, national security offenses, but here it's fraud or deceit.              I mean, it's a felony, but there's nothing that strikes -- strikes me that it's particularly an aggravated felony.                   And yet that's all you have to prove with the protections of the criminal law as opposed to the civil.                   But not subject to the protections of criminal law that you have to show.                   Beyond the reasonable doubt, with the jury protections.                   Yes, I guess what I'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated, the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit.                   And as I said, there's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.                     Well, that's just -- I think that's kind of begging the question.                  You assume that those elements, those provisions also don't have to be proved as elements.        And what I'm suggesting, I guess, is that if the only thing that makes it aggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to look, well, is that really aggravated?                     And when you're talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography, yes, that's aggravated; but fraud and deceit is kind of a run of the mine felony.                     Well, I guess I don't understand how that's responsive.                    It's -- it's --                     -- part of violence. In other words it seems to me you're already in the aggravated area, so it makes sense to say that's what you have to prove.                      I -- I guess I don't understand the answer, and I'm sorry if it's --                      It just -- you're saying is that there are exceptions, but I don't see that that detracts from the point that "crime of violence" -- you think right away, well, that's aggravated; national security crimes, that's aggravated; firearms offenses, that's aggravated.                     They're sort of on their own without respect to these other things that you say you only have to prove by the civil -- pursuant to the civil burden requirements.                  Fraud or deceit -- as I guess I've already said, that doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.                      What makes it aggravated is something as to which you have a much lighter burden.                   Thank you, Mr. Gannon.

So that's the line between is it going on.        But assuming the offense is -- the bank robbery is still going on, like he's got confederates gathering up the money or something, does that fall under your theory that the gun is discharged?                   So even if the police officer -- the police officer disarms the robber and ten minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes off.                   Well, assuming it is.   I mean, he has got the one guy neutralized but the others are still, you know, under the teller's window, and that isn't over.      So then the guy who is captured already gets an extra three years because the officer mishandled the gun?                   Well, there probably aren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such klutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes off, either.                    I interrupted your answer.                    It's entirely fortuitous; you have two bank robbers, they both do exactly the same thing, in one case the gun goes off and the other it doesn't.       Does that -- does it seem -- does it seem fair to add three years onto the sentence of the one whose gun happens to go off but not on the sentence of the one whose doesn't?                  Yes, they both did. That's my point, they both did exactly the same thing.                  You get three extra years for having bad luck?                  Well, is this guy likely to get life for a bank robbery, the gun accidentally goes off?        I don't know whether it's his first offense or not.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                 So if it turns out that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming -- you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't object, she gets that dramatic windfall.                 Oh, no, no.   She -- she -- and it may be even in good faith or -- or bad faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she gets that incredible bonus because it turns out her business equipment is worth a lot more than she put down.                 Well, this -- the trustee doesn't know.     He doesn't know.            He looks at it and says, oh, that sounds like kitchen equipment might be worth that, and so he doesn't object. What you're doing is, I think Justice Kennedy pointed out, you're requiring the trustee to object to everything, lest he lose the $100,000 that it turns out this is worth.                No, but the point is, that drags out the whole process.                You're imposing a burden on the trustee.       He loses everything if he doesn't object, and I think the idea is that these things move as quickly as you can, and you don't want the trustees -- you know, I may be severely prejudiced; the creditors might if I don't object, so I'm going to object to everything; we'll sort it out later.                 Thank you, counsel.

In other words, you are saying, you can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said, too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent off?                   Double, as they say is the case here?                   Double, as they say is the case here?                   Yes.                   Well, then you say Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the bounds.                  When you say you should look at the range and how far it's off, do you mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least look further at whether there was a fair process?                  Or do you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the rates you just look how far it is off.                 It's probably -- you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you understand the Solicitor General's position to be your understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?

BLUME ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    How far -- how far down do you go on applying the issue preclusion?                    Let's say there's a ruling by the court that a particular expert was not credible.           I mean, is that binding in a subsequent proceeding?                   Well, that's narrowing it to your particular context.                  I would have assumed that the theory has to be more generally applicable, and not just applicable in the particular Atkins context.    If you can have issue preclusion with respect to an underlying factual question under which the loser can assert that, I don't see why it wouldn't apply more generally.        That's a theory of the Double Jeopardy Clause, not of Atkins.                      Well, this strikes me as the sort of case where their incentives might well be different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested.                   If you're dealing with a borderline case, you don't -- and you think you have very compelling aggravating factors, you know, why call attention to the -- the mitigating factor of the mental condition when your case can be won on the others?
08-6 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Neufeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER NEUFELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Well, there was a more reliable one at the time of trial as well, and his counsel made the tactical decision not to use it because, I assume, she was concerned it would show his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.                   Well, but the whole point is that, Justice Ginsburg brought out the point, that he hasn't asserted his innocence under oath.                 So there's no cost to him for asking for the DNA evidence. If there's -- if we're writing up a new constitutional right and we require as part of that that he assert his innocence under perjury, and if he fails to do that, he'll be prosecuted for perjury, that might at least put some limitation on the number of people who can assert the right.                      So if it is so clear --                      Sorry, counsel.   If it is so clear that this is the right way to go, that the Federal Government, 41 States -- does it make sense for us to devise a constitutional right to displace what the legislatures have done?                   It is exactly a question of displacing what the States have done because now this question is going to be subject to constitutional law and it's going to be litigated in a variety of cases with a variety of claims.                     Do you get the right to it when you confess?                  Do you get the right to it when you've waived it at trial?                     Do you get the continuous right to it as technology advances and makes the test more sensitive?           All of those matters will be Federal constitutional questions for us to decide.                   Well, but the whole question -- it is kind of along the same lines I've been talking.     The reason they might -- they're saying don't adopt that test, is because the question is whether it should be adopted as a matter of constitutional law. They may, and I suspect they do since they represent the government, think Congress's balancing makes perfect sense.     It is a different question here.                   So, just to get back to the point you were making earlier, it really doesn't matter what the Congress said.                It is a question of rationality under the Constitution.                  Was his assertion before -- his confession -- his confessions before the parole board made under oath?                   So he's guilty of perjury one way or the other, either before the parole board or in his assertions of actual innocence here.                   Well, wouldn't it be ironic --                   Excuse me, counsel. Would it be ironic to say that you do not have access when you're guilty of perjury one way or the other?                   Do you have a --                   Do you have a constitutional right to the DNA evidence if the accuracy of the test was the same as the one that your counsel submitted at trial?                  In other words, limits it to -- what was it -- 16 percent or something like that?                  Well, all right. Then, obviously, the next question is at level of accuracy does your constitutional right no longer apply?                  Well, just so to follow up on that -- so you -- if -- if the evidence showed that there was -- would show that there was a one out of two chance that your client was innocent, then you think you still have a right -- a constitutional right of access to that evidence?                    So fingerprint -- fingerprints apparently are covered by it.                  They have fingerprint evidence that they are not releasing.                     So do you have a constitutional right of access to that evidence?                    No, I'm sure --                    I'm sure they're not as accurate as the DNA tests.              I'm trying to figure out what the limit of the constitutional right you're asserting is.                      Sorry.   I'm sorry. With the different questions asked, I have lost where the answer is.    You say it is still part of the constitutional right if he forewent the test at trial, or it is not?                   What if there was a videotape?    Is that covered by the constitutional right you are asserting?                   Are there photographs or other evidence that --                   That's a good point. What -- how long under the Constitution does the State have to retain this evidence?                   Would that be a corollary of the constitutional right you are asking for here?                   And I agree that would be -- that -- yes.         I am just wondering if there would be any objection to an absolute rule that says what:   After two years, after one year of conviction?                  Was he released on parole with respect to this offense?                  And was his confession a necessary predicate to that release?                  So a confession that would be perjurious if he claimed actual innocence now was responsible for his release?                  I understand that.                  But he's been -- other than other crimes he committed, he's been released on the basis of what you say is an unprincipled confession.    And now he is --                  So his parole was revoked because he committed another offense?                  Okay.   Thank you, counsel.

GEOGHEGAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  But we have rules like that -- we have rules like that all the time.                     No matter how clear it is what happened below, if it wasn't included in the question presented, we say you can't raise it.     This is just a rule like that. They have a rule saying this is what you have to do, you have got to put the evidence of conferencing in -- in the record at a particular time. You didn't do it, so we are not going to -- the fact that on the facts, on the real facts, it occurred is not an adequate challenge to the procedural rule.                  You think there is now?   In other words, this is -- rulemaking by adjudication is not unheard of.                   So is it -- is -- where is the rule that there has to be conferencing?                   So you think -- you think that was where the board erred, in requiring conferencing?                   Well, it's -- can the board adopt procedures about how you go about proving conferencing?      You say there is no rule because there wasn't a rule adopted in 1934.                   There is a rule that there has to be conferencing.                Does that mean that at any point in time you can just pop up and say, oh, by the way, there was conferencing?               Or can the board say, this is how you go about establishing it?                   So they can -- the board can never have a rule that says, you have to establish conferencing, you know, before the date of the first arbitral proceeding, or within 30 days?                  The fact that all that has to happen under the act is that there be conferencing, you are free to establish it at any way you want, at any time you want?                 Where -- where does it say the unions have to send in letters requesting a conference?                  So could the board -- could the board adopt a rule requiring that?                     Just to be clear, you say it's established practice that the railroads normally file their objection at a -- you know, at a particular point, and you think the board is without power to say:     Look.    This is the established practice. You, railroad, did not follow it, and so we're not going to consider your objections.                     No.   No.   You mean that they -- the board can't do that?                  I thought, under the Steelworkers trilogy, the arbitrators has broad deference to adopt these sorts of modes of procedure.                  That we would review only for whatever it is.                  So the review -- the review of government arbitrators arbitrating provisions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the standard of review of that is different than private arbitrators under the Steelworkers trilogy?                  But you don't think that this is that.     I mean, if you say:               Look.   Here's the rule.     You have got to file these things by this date, that is not imposing your own rule of industrial justice.                 I'm saying that, if the board adopts a procedure exactly like that, you may challenge it as-- as violating due process because you didn't have notice, any number of things, but you can't say that the board is imposing its own brand of industrial justice. That sort of seems, to me, goes to the merits in the standards of arbitration, rather than procedures like this, unless it's a procedure like was hypothesized earlier, that only applies to one side and not the other.                  Presumably, there is none that says they don't have to be.                    In other words, I take it that this is an issue that is simply not addressed by the CFR rules?                 Well, you are just disputing the validity or applicability of the rule. You don't want to comply with the rule.                 I mean, is it any different than saying:           Look, okay, we've got this arbitration that is going to go forward.                 We are going to meet at 10:00 Monday morning.                It is the first meeting.   One side doesn't show up and then they say, well, there's no rule that says we have to be there at 10:00 Monday morning; that's just the arbitrator saying that to -- to move the procedure along, so you can't penalize us in any way for not showing up at 10:00 Monday morning.                  Do you recall the situation -- do you recall the situation Justice Breyer described, and we can debate about it, whether it's rulemaking by adjudication, which does take place, you would say that in the situation you described, it violated due process, right?                    So you think you could submit that offer of proof at any time during the proceeding and the board would have to accept it?                    Why wouldn't the other side say we don't have to raise the objection at a particular time.   You can't make a rule telling us we have to do that.                  So your answer to my earlier question is that you can submit that offer of proof at any time, and it has to be considered?

LONG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Yes, but the argument is that because a private interested party can't bring it, the party is bringing it on behalf of the United States and his plea agreement therefore is with the United States.                   As representative of the sovereign?                   And nobody doubts -- I didn't think it was at issue that the United States, rather than operating through the Assistant U.S. Attorney, can appoint you to handle the prosecution.                   And that's what they don't dispute, right?                     I'm sorry, that's - they don't dispute that?           That's the point you were trying to make?                  Okay.                  Well, one way you can find it in the Constitution is that we have built a body of law about the obligation of people bringing prosecutions that wouldn't fit within your situation. For -- what are the Brady -- what's the Brady obligation of your client?                  What are the Brady obligations of your client?                   What -- what are the Brady obligations of your client?                   Well, unless you think it's a violation of due process for an interested party to be able to criminally prosecute someone at their -- at their discretion.                  Those are in every state?                     But can your private prosecutor, however you want to describe her, could she enter into a plea agreement with the defendant?                  No, she said you could be subject to you 180 days; I will agree, and you'll plead guilty to 30 days.                   Thank you, counsel. General Kagan.

The different U.S. Attorneys all work for your boss, right?             They work for the Attorney General.   How can one part of the Attorney General agree to something that doesn't bind the other part of the Attorney General?                     I take your word for it. (Laughter.)                   Maybe or maybe not, but surely it binds the New Jersey U.S. Attorney.                      If you -- just think about it.              The -- the U.S. Attorney from the Southern District says:                 Look, you agree to go to jail for 10 years and I will drop these 3 charges. Done.   Then the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey can come in and prosecute under those three charges?                   Well, how do you get -- I mean, you are a defendant.                       You have to go to all more than 50, all the U.S. Attorney's Offices and say, will you agree to this and get everybody to sign off?                  It can't do that. If the U.S. attorney in New Jersey has the authority to prosecute this, the U.S. Attorney in New York can't say, oh, and by the way I bind all the other U.S. Attorneys.                  Usually we have questions the other way.                  Counsel, could I ask you could a 1983 or I guess Bivens action be brought against Ms. Watson?      The defendant, you know, it turns out he's not guilty and he thinks there was malice. Could he bring a Bivens action against her?                  She's a State actor. She's acting on behalf either of the United States or the District of Columbia.            Therefore, she can be sued directly and be personally liable.                  Yes, briefly.

DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE                Mr. Dreeben, we learn in the first year of law school that the line between an affirmative act and failure to act is a difficult one to draw.        What if the lawyer says, you're going to face 5 years, and the defendant says, is that all that's going to happen to me?              And the lawyer says yes.   Is that a failure to advise or is that an affirmative misrepresentation?                I think when we -- when we decide there's no right to counsel, like on collateral review, we don't even look at what happened, right?    We don't look and see whether the advice was ineffective, how bad the lawyer was.                The idea is if you don't have the right at all, you don't have the right to an effective lawyer.                Is that right? Okay.    Well, these -- when you are talking about collateral consequences, you don't have a right to counsel on -- with respect to those collateral consequences.    I assume there's -- maybe there is -- is there a right to counsel when you are facing a deportation proceeding?                Okay.                   Well, then, if there is no right to counsel, why do we get into whether there is an affirmative misrepresentation or not?                   Just like in a collateral -- habeas context, we don't care whether there s an affirmative misreputation  - misrepresentation, because there s no right to counsel in the first place.                  Not the defendant, but a defendant?    In other words, I assume it's an objective inquiry you would make rather than a subjective one?                We assume, for example, that someone who is going to lose the custody of their children would regard that as important.                You don't want testimony about this guy doesn't care about the children, so it's not a big deal to him.                Won't -- won't your test result in a net loss to defendants?              I assume, if this is adopted as a rule, the affirmative misrepresentation rule, then every lawyer is going to say what you said they should say:              I'm here for the criminal case; I'm not telling you anything about anything else --                -- as opposed to saying -- sitting down and saying:                 Here's what you need to know.     And in most cases we expect the lawyer to do a professional job.     If you have got an alien, he is going to tell him:     Well, what -- you know, this will cause you to be deported. Instead, every lawyer now is going to say:     I'm not giving you any advice about anything else.                   How do we know that?                Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Long.

So let's say there's a judgment and the government looks at it and says:                 Well, we didn't know we would get a decision like this; We've got to appeal this.    The relator doesn't want to appeal it.                  30 days goes by.     The Government moves to intervene because it has 60 days.                  So for all the reasons in the legislative history that you discussed about why the government gets more time, those reasons don't apply in that situation?                   Counsel, I -- I pressed your friend about what's the big deal, why don't you just file within 30.          It only seems fair to press you on what's the big deal with letting them have for 60 --                   -- which also solves the problem of the potential trap for the unwary.                     Well, I agree with that.   I agree with that.           But what if we say --                     I'm sorry.   What if I say, or whoever is writing the opinion says, this is only for purposes of filing the appeal?                   We don't decide whether the government is a party in all these other characteristics, but whether it comes to Rule 4(a) --                     Well, it should be construed narrowly.       I don't think saying whether it's 30 or 60 days at all implicates that principle.                     Well, yeah, but I mean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing it narrowly.   But the whole question is that there's some confusion in the rule about who's right, and all I'm saying is it seems to me that it would be the easiest thing to avoid any trap for the unwary with no consequences on the other side, to say 60 days.                   Oh, this isn't going to delay appeals, for heaven's sakes.                   I mean, there's all sorts of scheduling rules about the timing of the briefs and everybody gets an extension on their briefs. This is going to have no effect whatever on how quickly appeals move along.                  Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS                     What -- why do you care?   I mean, you're just giving people who might well be confused by this provision another 30 days.                   Okay, but, again, we would limit any decision to Federal Rule of Appeal 4 because of the dramatically adverse consequences for the unwary.    They lose their right to pursue their case.                   Well, I just does did.    Under FRAP 4, you're out the door without any hearing on the merits.        It's a technicality.               The spirit of the rules is that we don't throw people out because of mere technicalities.         Now, failure to file a timely notice of appeal is not a technicality in terms of the consequences.                  I'm sure that the Appellate Rules Advisory Committee, when they hear this decision, if they haven't already, will put something in the rules about whether it's 30 days or 60 days.                 So I'm not terribly concerned about clarity going forward. It's going to be made clear by the Advisory Committee and the submission of new rules, and I see no reason that they wouldn't make it clear.                  I don't know whether they'll think 30 or 60 is the best idea.                   So it's just a question of -- in this case and, as Justice Stevens pointed out, what the effect is going to be on other cases.     And it seems to me that in that situation, 60 days makes the most sense because otherwise you're disrupting the system solely based on a trap for the unwary.

LEVY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                Well, but if it's a plausibility standard at the threshold inquiry, there s a range of things, and I guess your -- your friend on the other side is just saying selling logos is closer to selling houses than it is to playing football.               So if there s a factual -- if there s a factual dispute about whether a particular activity of the league is designed to promote the game or is designed simply to make more money, than that is the sort of thing that goes to trial?               Or do something else, do something other than promote the game?
08-67 +++$+++                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   You are asking us for a pretty dramatic extension of Powell.                Powell is not a case involving subsequent prosecutions.                   Well, that's because in the same proceeding you have two different jury verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously, one way and one the other way.             So to protect the jury's conclusions, you couldn't give effect to one without undermining the other. It's a very different case here.                The only jury determination you have is the acquittal.               If you give effect -- if you don't give effect to the findings in the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only determination by the jury.                     Well, the -- the point about the big extension, you were rather coy in your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson. Are you asking us to revisit that?                    Well, you're not going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?                    If we rely on that the case is pretty easy, isn't it?                    The person was in jeopardy on the hung offense as well.                   Under this Court's decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause.                      I think that's right, and your argument depends upon that interest balancing against the interest in giving effect to the acquittal verdict. Now, what if I think, under the Seventh Amendment that's -- that what is important is protecting jury verdicts?    And the interest in the irrational case, when you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you have two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the other without undermining one of them.                    Here, however, you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal without undermining another jury verdict.                    You certainly undermine the government's interest in prosecuting after a hung jury, but if I think what's important under the Seventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case comes out the other way, right?                   Well, he -- he carried that burden before the court of appeals.                   Revisiting of that issue was not included within the question presented.                    So if we -- if we agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict that we granted cert to resolve would still continue.                    Your -- your theory depends upon viewing a hung jury as constituting some action by the jury.     Now, obviously it does in some sense. But if you view -- if you accept the proposition that juries only act by returning verdicts, and that's the reason you can retry, because with a hung jury the jury hasn't really done anything in the way jurors act, then the case comes out -- then the defendant prevails, right?                   Yes.
08-674 +++$+++                 General Blumenthal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  You're in a very tough position because of the way this has progressed. I think you can make a strong argument that you shouldn't be bound by these contract rates if FERC doesn't have a lot of discretion to let you go.                If FERC has a lot of discretion to let you go, your argument that you shouldn't be bound is a lot weaker.                 And the way the case has been presented, we're pushing on only one -- one side of that.                Well, but if we ruled that --                If we decided it on that basis, we would be giving FERC a victory on the question of its authority to depart from Mobile-Sierra, even though that wasn't presented in this case.                Oh, I know --                -- but Justice Breyer was hypothesizing that sometimes they can be, and sometimes they can't be.        And you accepted his proposition. And what I'm saying is that's a very significant question.       FERC wants to argue it here, but it's not before us.                 It's also a third question that's not presented, right?
08-678 +++$+++                   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Resnik. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH RESNIK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    We will get to that, I think, when the government lawyer gets up.                  But does that distinction make sense to you?                    Government lawyers get the privilege, private lawyers don't?                   But we are talking about the central privilege to the maintenance of the adversary system which we've determined to be central to maintaining the rule of law.            This is not like the other privileges, priest-penitent, other evidentiary privileges, because it is the privilege that allows lawyers to protect the interests in those other cases. And it just seems to me that -- that to allow a single ruling by a district court judge to undermine the privilege is going to affect people. What -- I mean, the statement of the lawyer could be, look, you are going to lose this case, and you are saying the district court can require the disclosure of that without allowing at least a quick trip to the court of appeals to check it out.                  Well, it matters which they do, right?      If they are denying disclosure the statistics don't mean much.                  But it is a bit of a hurdle, isn't it, since you do have to satisfy the materially advanced -- the litigation and those other criteria?                   The usual way that the district court, after denying the recognition of the privilege, insists that people proceed is, they want the lawyer to go to jail.      They say, You've got contempt, you can appeal contempt.        The district judges, as you've mentioned, they want these things to move on and they tend not to think that their rulings are in error, and the lawyers are frequently confronted with an extremely difficult choice, of violating what they think is their ethical obligation or going to jail.                 Well, a protective order isn't going to work -- a protective order isn't going to work at all.      You're not going to -- I mean, the lawyers on the other side get the privileged material, so they don't care -- I mean, in terms of the viability and protection of the privilege, it doesn't matter if the clients get it.                   Well, but the -- you know, the -- the American Bar Association has said the exact opposite.     It will say that the opening up of the privilege and the disclosure, however rare the case is, will, in fact, undermine the -- the value of the privilege.                   Oh, sure, the other people are, too, but we -- I, at least, look at a brief of the American Bar Association and view that as a representation of how the people affected here, the lawyers, view the value of the privilege and what will happen to it.                 Oh, but the law -- the law professors aren't the ones who deal with this question on a day-to-day basis and have to worry about going to jail, if they want to protect their client's -- what they view as their ethical obligations.                  Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler? ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT                     Well, except when the government is the one raising it.                     Yes, but, in the government context, what would be in the private context, an attorney-client privilege, is redressed as a different type of governmental privilege. When you give advice to a government agency, you don't call that the attorney-client privilege.                    You call it a governmental privilege, a deliberative privilege, all these other things. In the private sector, when you are an attorney and you give advice to a client, you can't say, This has got something.        It's the attorney-client privilege.                 So you are saying that you -- government lawyers cannot seek an interlocutory appeal of any privilege claimed, other than Presidential communications and State secrets?                  I'm sorry.   There are problems with 1292(b).         Are you telling me, when your office writes a letter to the Department of Interior and says, Look, we are not going to appeal -- we will appeal your case, but we think you have got a really bad case, you are likely to lose; and you assert -- the only privilege you can assert is the attorney-client privilege, and, if a district judge says, that's not covered, for one reason or another, you -- you don't get an interlocutory appeal?                  You don't think that the attorney-client privileges rises to the level of who gets to -- who has to put up security for costs that was an issue in Cohen?                 We are not talking about -- I guess what, perhaps, the case comes down to is, if you think the attorney-client privilege is like every other evidentiary privilege that you have just listed, relevance, materiality, all those sorts of things, or if you think the attorney-client privilege is different, even more important than who has to post security for costs, because it is central to the rule of law, because it is central to how the adversary system functions.                   But the review -- I follow your answer but the review on final judgment is meaningless.   I mean, the cat is out of the bag.                 The injury to the party, but not the injury to the attorney-client privilege.                  Putting aside the question of whether the attorney-client privilege has a good pedigree in public law, my experience has been that litigants on one side frequently request and demand in discovery material that they know is covered by the attorney-client privilege, one, precisely because that's where the good stuff is; and two, because it gives them leverage, because they know that the other side is going to have to go through this impossible process and can't get an immediate appeal. Why isn't that a concern that we should have?
08-680 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Davis. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CELIA A. DAVIS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    I'm sorry to interrupt you -- interrupt there, and I will let you get back to the answer.      They should attempt to do so.                    The rule here does not allow the police to approach that person, a murder suspect.           And you are saying he cannot even be approached to see if he would waive his rights ten years later because he was -- invoked the right in connection with joy riding?                  Okay.                 Well, but not --                 It was one day.    He said he wanted the --                 -- to remain silent in the evening, and at 9:00 the next morning they were back.                 So then I don't understand why your answer to Justice Alito's hypothetical was what it was, because that person obvious was not in custody.                    Well, but the Miranda Rights do not require the police to provide counsel.   They have to mean -- mean you have to stop questioning, until the person has right to counsel.                    And the one thing this person knew from the prior Miranda situation -- was 2003?                 Is that, if he said, "I don't want to talk without counsel," the one thing he knew is that the police would stop questioning because that's what they did.                 Well, Miranda doesn't --                 Go ahead.                    Well, you say, "in captivity," but you think the rule applies, whether they are in captivity or not.          In -- in Justice Alito's hypothetical, the person was free for 40 years, so captivity is not a limitation on your -- your proposed rule.                   Well, I suppose, if they are in a pretrial detention center, they know they are still being looked at for the crime as to which they have invoked the Miranda warnings.                   So you wouldn't call that -- and I don't understand the other side to argue that that is -- there is a break in custody there.                   No. No.   I agree with you.   There shouldn't be a break there, but, here, the situation is quite different.                There is a break between jail for questioning and prison for 15 years -- or whatever your sentence is.                  That is a -- isn't that a Sixth Amendment question?               That's not a Miranda question, if he has not been provided a lawyer.                   Right.    Right.   And it's the Fifth Amendment we are worried about, and that is directed to coercion --                   -- and that is addressed, if you stop questioning him.                  You don't even start questioning him, if he says, Look, I don't want to talk without a lawyer.                   Talking stopped, as it did the very -- the first time he was approached.                  So if he says -- I'm sorry --                  Are you done answering? So if he said, instead of I want to talk to a lawyer, if he said, I want to remain silent, your case comes out differently?         He doesn't say anything about a lawyer.     He says, Look, I don't want to talk to you.                  Well, but all your arguments about he hasn't been provided a lawyer, there is an ethical obligation to provide a lawyer.                  Those -- those are off the table.
08-681 +++$+++                    Thank you, counsel. General Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Do you -- do you agree with your friend that the basic difference between your two positions is that under the stay factors you are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not allowed to consider that under (f)(2).                    So I take it at least in the Seventh Circuit these things are usually granted?                    So in this -- in this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing evidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they haven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked, even for example if the court of appeals thinks, well, yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.                      This provision applies to us as well, I take it, right?                      So if there is a cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to removal, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to decide whether he meets the clear and convincing evidence standard.                      We should have -- we should have done this in this case, but I assume you suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?                  It's pretty close to it, though. (Laughter.)

It's a lot simpler and also clearer than to say physical force against the person.                   Wait, I don't follow that at all.   I mean, I understand your argument that physical force means the slightest touching, but I don't understand the argument that the slightest touching presents a serious risk of potential physical injury.                   Yeah, but your argument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest physical touching is covered by the statute.                    Well, every indication except for the fact that they didn't use the word battery.
08-724 +++$+++                  Thank you, General. Mr. Benza. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. BENZA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     You say -- you fault him for not talking about performance in prison, prospective performance in prison?                     It doesn't look like that's going to be a very strong argument.                    I mean, he is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you are going to get up there and say he might perform well in prison?                  He is on the stand with a Hitler moustache testifying about what a great job he did killing these people, and he says he is going to do it again.   I think -- didn't the letter identify particular people he wanted to kill?                  And the jury is supposed to believe that this guy is going to do well in prison?                  But I guess it gets back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a jury would think and isn't it possible.                  You are suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws that are there, this might help.              But isn't it possible that that would have a negative effect on the jury?                  In other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's credibility is -- is shot.                    But, I mean, it seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are telling us he has to have. Here's why you should give this guy sympathy.   Here's why.        Here's -- he's a good guy.             I mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very proud of the fact that we don't execute -- you know, it seems to me that this disagreement is over different styles of advocacy. And I don't know how to -- particularly in a case where you don't have much to work with, I don't know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse than the other.                  So if you're -- if you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our own, without deference to the State court findings?                 Counsel, the Mills opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we conclude there is a substantial probability that reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.                   Now how is that clearly established law that your claim is -- is contrary to Mills?                   That is on death or nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating circumstance exists.                  Where does that say what your summary was earlier, that they -                  -- can't consider a mitigating circumstance unless they unanimously agree about it.                  Well, doesn't every court tell them it's their duty to decide disputed questions of fact?                  And you think that includes within it the idea that they -- they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they all 12 agree on it?                  Okay, I just -                  It is that the sentence that says "it's your duty to did decide all disputed questions of fact is the same as saying they are instructed that they cannot consider a mitigating circumstance unless they are unanimous?

Am I right that you would exclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?                   Well, that doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense.                 Before the motion for extension was filed, the hearing date for pretrial motions was September 20.                After the extension was filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th. So the only period of delay that you could say resulted from the extension was from September 20 to October 4, or 13 days. Well, how can you possibly count the time as a delay after he filed his extension up to the point when things would have been due anyway?                 Well, but how is that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed anyway?                 In other words, the motions were not due until September 25th.                 So I don't see how the time he spent before then can be regarded as a delay.                  What is the -- what is the proceeding from which you count in determining what should be excluded?                  Okay, that order -- that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day. The person comes in and says:           I would like time.           The judge that same day says yes.                  That proceeding takes a day.                  The additional time flowing from the order is a proceeding?                   Right.                   Right.                   And that's one day.                   Ah.   Now that -- now -- now I don't see how that's consistent with the other provisions of the act.      If you take (h)(1)(A), that excludes delay resulting from any proceeding to determine mental competency.           Okay?                   And under your theory that would include the time from the filing of that motion to the end of the determination of mental competency, right?                   Ah.   Well -- yes. Well, or -- yes ---no, I'm looking at (h)(4).                 Now (h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.                 It seems to me redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination and then also exclude mental incompetence.                 All right.   Well, let's look at (h)(1)(G).        That excludes delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea agreement.   But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in which prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written -- written agreement with the defendant, for the purpose of allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct, which sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.                  If I disagree with you that, when the time that is extended before a hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the original date, and the date that it actually took place, which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your submission, which is that the whole time from the filing of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then you lose, right?                   Putting aside what Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that the delay is only how far the date for consideration of a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose, right?                   Well, I guess it would be, take 15 days from what time you have calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is it above the wire?                   In other words, I am contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much days you think can be excluded or not excluded.                  Counsel, this may be the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to make sure I've got your answer.             Let's say the original date for filing motions is, as it was here, September 13th, right?      On September 7th, Mr. Bloate asks for additional time.        So the judge's, you know, runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day. One more day, so now it's due on September 14th. You would say the delay resulting from that extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.                  So the delay -- so saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions results in a delay from a pretrial motion?
08-7412 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Gowdy. Mr. Makar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                Well, but you are arguing for a categorical rule of your own.                You are saying that under a -- under -- juveniles under the age of 18, what, it's never -- it can be never determinative that they are juvenile in setting the sentence as a matter of Federal law?                But then the -- what is your objection to an approach that when you are dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of Federal law consider the juvenile status of the defendant before that sentence is imposed?                In other words, not a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can never make a difference?                And -- and there's -- well, I guess that answers my question.                He is not required to as a matter of Federal law.                He can say:   I am not considering the fact that this is a juvenile because I think his crime should be treated as an adult crime.                 Well, that's what we are arguing about.                In -- in your earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's question, you said age certainly matters.           As -- as a -- as a matter of what law? In other words, I understood your submission to be that there was nothing in Federal law that requires different consideration of age.                 So when you say age matters, why?                Under the authority of what law?     Age matters in a particular case because of --                Because of the Eighth Amendment?                I'm sorry.   Why is that?   If you go down on a case-by-case basis, there are no line-drawing problems.       You just simply say age has to be considered as a matter of the Eighth Amendment.                Well, we apply the proportionality review that we articulated in Harmelin, and Solem and Ewing.                It's already there.                  Well, along those lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus briefs.   Do you have a study about what age cohort is responsible for most violent crime?                 Thank you, Mr. Makar. Mr. Gowdy, you have 4 minutes remaining.

A 16-year-old committing the crimes that Graham committed; a 13-year-old committing the crimes that Sullivan committed?                My point is, if you had to consider youth as one of the factors that we consider under proportionality analysis, how do you come out?                Off the charts on age or off the charts on violence?                My --                Go ahead.                Would -- would the standards applied in that situation be any different than the standards that would apply if you prevailed on his reading of the procedural bar?                I'm just trying to see if this jurisdictional issue makes any difference. If you are saying -- it sounds to me like you're saying, well, if he wins, he wins, and, if he loses, he loses. I don't think he cares whether it's under the procedural bar or some other basis.
08-769 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Ms. Millett. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Counsel, I think -- I think Ferber analytically is the hard case for you, because the Court in Ferber did said -- and I am quoting from page 763:     "The evil to be restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interest at stake."   That was their articulation of the test.                 Now, why shouldn't we apply that test to this statute?                  Well, I mean, but this definition or these exceptions are not drawn out of thin air.    They are drawn from Miller, and the Court in Miller recognized that they were significant in causing the restriction of obscenity to pass constitutional muster.                    I --                  I understood your answers to Justice Alito to acknowledge that there would be situations where this statute could be constitutionally applied, or as you put it, you could draft a statute.                  Not this statute. But --                  But if in fact there were situations where we thought a narrowly drafted statute could be applied to particular instances, perhaps the crush videos, perhaps others, why isn't that enough to say that this statute is valid on its face and then we will consider as-applied challenges?                  I guess I am just trying to get at what your understanding of what the test is for overbreadth in this area.                    How much of an area of constitutional application is necessary before you decide that a statute is not unconstitutional on its face, but will consider as-applied challenges?                     I'm sorry; you agree you can prohibit it, or not?                   So I'm sorry.   I'm still looking for your answer to Justice Alito's hypotheticals. Can Congress ban the human sacrifice channel or not?                  You are unwilling -- you are unwilling to say that Congress can pass a law, even-handed, straightforward, you cannot have a human sacrifice channel.                  So we don't like -- we don't like human sacrifice, and so Congress passes a law saying you cannot have a channel that shows human sacrifice -- real human sacrifice.                  You think that is unconstitutional?                    Well, right, but, I mean, the hypothetical is we can't do anything about it. It is beyond our reach to stop the human sacrifice taking place wherever in the world, so that that argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table. In that situation, you think it's unconstitutional for Congress to pass a law saying there can be no human sacrifice channel.                    No.   Go ahead.
08-810 +++$+++               Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Stris. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS            Counsel, if I could switch to the deference point.            Let's say you have an administrator who says I interpret this particular provision to mean A; and he says but, if that's rejected, there are these other provisions that should be read to mean B.     That goes up; the court -- the rejects A. Does the administrator get deference on his reading of the other provisions B?            No, but I think it's kind of odd to say to the administrator:             Look, if you want discretion, you should make as many rulings as you can possibly think of because then you ll get discretion as to each of them.            But if you only do what s efficient and say here's how I read it, then you don't get any discretion at all on the other provisions.            So you re saying it's not just that they abused their discretion; they're discretion abusers?           You can't trust them on the next provision?             We do that with the district court.     We get a district court, and we use all of these pejorative terms --  abuse of discretion,   arbitrary and capricious,   clear error -- and we send it back for them to do the same -- you know, they make -             They're the fact finder.     Here, the plan administrator is the primary interpreter.            I'm sorry.   What's the relevant principle?        Isn't it what the lump sum was that he took out?              Well, they chose to take it out of that plan, right?            Well, since that s a fairly stark disagreement among counsel on a factual matter, where in the record do you see 5 years?            It put in the words "phantom account"?                But defer doesn't mean uphold in every circumstance, does it?                Okay, well, then I don't think it's proper to say they can choose not to defer.     They can defer and -- and choose to find it's still an abuse of discretion.             Just so I understand, there are two different views.                One is we are going to listen to you, and we may not agree with you.     And the other is we re not even going to listen to you.     And you are arguing for the second rule.             You think the proper way to approach this is saying we don't care, plan administrator, what you think.               Well, sure. (Laughter.)               Right.               They don't even need to accept a brief from the plan administrator --               Thank you, counsel. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS              What about the hypothetical I asked your friend?             You know, this is how we read the provision, reading A, and we recognize there s some ambiguity there, and if a court disagrees with it, our -- our second reading is -- is B.              No deference on B?              Does that make sense?   I mean, don't you want the administrators to give you their best -- best understanding?              Yes, they can --              They can -- they can take it to the extreme.       But if it looks like a good faith effort, to say -- you know, it's tough to interpret and administer these plans, and they say, this is what we think it means, but we re human; maybe we made a mistake.    And this is --            So one strike and you re out?            I mean, that's assuming, it seems to me -- it makes sense if there s bad faith.               I mean, you make fallback arguments.     You re here and say this is how we read this, but if you don't agree with it, this is how we read it.            So if --            So you disagree with Mr. Stris.    Do you think the district court should listen to what the plan administrator has to say?
08-861 +++$+++                  General Kagan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES                 No.   I thought the employees were appointed by the chairman, not by the commission.                So you think -- you think a -- a veto power is the same as an original -- original power?                Well, let's say --                Let's say that the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands documents from a particular company.                Can the SEC direct them not to do that?                 Will that be consistent -- do you think that will be consistent with the intent of Congress in establishing the PCAOB?                 Why did -- just out of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's going to be entirely controlled by the SEC?                Before we get -- before you get too far into that, of those first two things, is there any reason Congress couldn't have achieved those same objectives by establishing the PCAOB as a division within the SEC?                 Does it have consequences for public companies subject to the board if it refuses to turn over documents requested by this -- this board?                 Oh, I know, but presumably you only get a subpoena when people don't cooperate.                 And what happens if they don't?                 Are there any other -- are there any consequences from the company's refusal short of -- that would not require the board to get a subpoena?                 In the absence of the subpoena, if nothing happens?                 Is it -- does it have a consequence as a practical matter for the company if it doesn't comply with a request from this board?                 So there are in fact collateral consequences that take place without any involvement by the SEC?                 So if you had a statute here that said, look, if you don't comply with the board's request for documents, your authorities will be suspended, and if that were the statute, you would say, well, that's okay, because the SEC can always change that rule.                I'm sorry, I asked you whether there were any consequences from the failure of the company to turn over documents; and is your answer that there are no consequences whatever?                  Yes, yes.                  Right.   That's Humphrey's Executor.     But you have to add to Humphrey's Executor Perkins and Morrison.            Humphrey's Executor says you can limit the President's removal power.                   That doesn't get you down to the board.                 You have to also say the principal officers -- there can be limits on their removal authority of the board members.                I didn't say anything bad about Humphrey's Executor. (Laughter.)                What is -- I'm sorry.   What is the removal authority of the SEC with respect to board officers?                All right.     So there is a limitation there.     For cause does not include failure to follow the policies of the President.                So you need to rely on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can do with respect to the board constitutional.                And you need to rely on Humphrey's Executor to make the limitations on what the President can tell the SEC constitutional.                Oh, no, no, because you have got an extra layer there.               Let's say, I mean, that you have to have two violations of the for-cause provision.   You have got to have -- you have to meet the requirement in two places.        When the SEC wants to remove the board member, they can only do that for cause.               And if they decide, well, there isn't cause, I'm not going to do it, then the President under your theory has to remove the SEC commissioners, all of them, not just -- not just the chairman, and he can only do that for cause. So you have got "for cause" squared, and that's -- that's a significant limitation that Humphrey's Executor didn't recognize and Morrison didn't recognize.                 Which one are we talking about, the first one or the second one?                 Well, let's just talk -- a practical example.             The board says I want to get the documents of company X.             The SEC thinks they shouldn't do that.   Okay?       Can they remove them for that situation -- in that situation?                 Can they say --                 -- you are fired? Can they say, you are fired because we have control over what you do and we don't think you should do that?                 The easiest way to do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a rule.                 Can the President pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?                 He thinks -- he thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't. So the SEC tells the board, don't go after that company, and because they do that the President fires the SEC. Does that work under your theory?                Right.                I'm not worried if it's the same.   I'm worried if it's enough.                Right.   And then --                It goes further because you ve got to rely on the SEC to get to the board.   So there you ve got to rely on Perkins and Morrison.                  What do they have to say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be removed by the President?                  And you are not contesting it?                  Thank you, General.                  Mr. Lamken. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD, ET AL.                 I thought -- so you disagree with General Kagan?              I thought she said one of the reasons for taking the board outside the SEC is that they d have an independent funding stream.                Well, the board can act, and the SEC can, I suppose, retroactively veto their actions, but the SEC doesn't propose what actions the board takes, actions that can have significant, devastating consequences for the regulated bodies.                I'm not talking about rules.     Agencies in the government do not act only in implementing a particular rule.                 They have authority to regulate. And the board here, for example, can tell a particular entity:     You have to turn over these documents.     They don't have to have a rule that says, this company must turn over the documents.                Is there any other --                Is there any other situation in the vast federal bureaucracy, where you have this two-level situation that we have here?                In other words, the President can't remove the SEC commissioners at will. They can't remove the PCAOB commissioners at will.                  Or even if you look at it from the for-cause perspective, there has to be two layers of  for cause.                What -- well, give me an example.                The formulation --                The formulation -- excuse me.                 The formulation that you use and your friend the Solicitor General have used -- has used is that they have the same authority that they have over every other independent agency, but I'm -- it's very hard to find out exactly what that authority is. So what is your position about the authority of the President?    Is it more than for cause or only for cause?                 What do you understand that position to be?                 So the President -- I guess I m following up on Justice Kennedy's question -- the President cannot call them and say, take this particular action in this particular case.

Well, Mr. Dreeben, you agree that it would be very unusual if in June we announced the opinion in your case agreeing with you and then the next case announced that the statute is unconstitutional?                 So is that -- does the right to intangible services refer to an obligation that is legal or moral?                 Only -- only legal? So that if in a State their corporate law says conflicts of interest with respect to spouse and children must be disclosed, but conflicts of interest with respect to nieces and nephews need not, you would say you cannot use this statute to prosecute somebody who, under some abstract sense, should have told their employer that, "My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead with this contract"?                    Counsel, could I ask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of the statute, does your theory give any independent substance to the word "right"? It seems, to me, your argument is that -- that someone who deprives another of honest services.                 I don't know where the concept of "right" comes in, which is in the statute.                    So the point -- I guess maybe this is -- maybe I asked you this before. The -- the right is not limited to specific legal obligations, but to a developing Federal common law of criminal liability?                  Sure.

What is the -- what is the distinction in your theory of the case between delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did -- what did the Vermont case say:                  Failure to do anything to move the case forward? When do we know that that's attributable to the defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?                    Of course, if the lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an ineffective-assistance claim?

How do we tell that that's the State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is doing through his lawyer?                   This is not an unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the private sector to ask for a continuance.                 It's quite common for the lawyers to go before the judge and say, look, I've got this other case going to trial next week, I've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges give them the first two but not the third.                And why in a case simply where you're dealing with a public defender do you presume the opposite and blame the State for what's a quite common practice in the private part?                   My point is, I guess, how do we tell?      I mean, if this is normal -- I think it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a defense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first time the trial date is set.           If it is normal, how do we tell?                   Yeah, but -- again, I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the private bar where that's true as well.                     What does your -- your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite vital principle in Polk County that public defenders work for their clients; they don't work for the State?                     Well, I guess fairly read, it does say the failure of several assigned counsel to do anything to move the case forward is attributable to the State, because they didn't do anything, I guess is the touchstone.                   Do you agree -- just following up --                   I'm sorry.   Just following up on your latest answer, do you agree that it has to be a systemic problem?             I mean, you gave us that -- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150 cases, I need a -- need a continuance. What if there's none of that?                  They've got, you know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy still delays.   He's responsible for not doing anything to move the case forward.                    Is it still attributable to the State?                   Well, when is that? The -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel appointed by the State does nothing to move the case forward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme Court touchstone.    When is that attributable to the State and when is it not?                   Well, I --                   It does sound to me, then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that that's attributable to the State, you would disagree with?   You would say no, there has to be a systemic problem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not supervising them, whatever.                  So your 14 months, just so I understand, that includes the August 2003 through June 2004, when Moore was representing him?

MAZE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Well, isn't it -- isn't it the case that under (d)(1) or (d)(2) that's a threshold determination, and once you get over that (e)(1) would have work to do in determining whether there was a violation of the Constitution or laws in the first place?                  That's under -- you've given yourself an easier case because you're going -- you're getting over the threshold under (d)(1).                  The problem is (d)(2) refers to determination of facts --                  -- and asks whether it's unreasonable.     (E)(1) talks about facts and has a whole different test, and I -- I guess the difficulty I've had is -- is reconciling the two.                      To the extent you can articulate their differences, why would you do both?                 Thank you, General.
08-964 +++$+++                  Thank you, Mr. Jakes. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Mr. Stewart, I thought I understood your argument up until the very last footnote in your brief.              And you say this is not -- simply the method isn't patentable because it doesn't involve a machine.    But then you say but it might be if you use a computer to identify the parties that you are setting a price between and if you used a microprocessor to calculate the price.       That's like saying if you use a typewriter to type out the -- the process, then it is patentable.    I -- I -- that takes away everything that you spent 53 pages establishing.                No, no.   That's just saying instead of looking at the -- in the Yellow Pages, you look on the computer.        And that makes all the difference to you?                But if you look at your footnote, that involves the most tangential and insignificant use of a machine.          And yet you say that might be enough to take something from patentability to not patentable?                 So you think it's a hard question.    If you develop a process that says look to the historical averages of oil consumption over a certain period and divide it by 2, that process would not be patentable.     But if you say use a calculator, then it -- then it is?                 But your footnote -- I don't mean to dwell on it -- it says to identify counterparties to the transactions.                  So that if what you're trying to get is the -- the baker who sells bread, because you are going to hook him up with the grocer who sells, you know, in the grocery store, if you punched in, in your search station -- you know, give me all the bakers in Washington -- that would make it patentable?                I'm sorry.   Did or did not?                 So what did that -- what did that transform?
08-969 +++$+++                      Thank you, counsel. Mr. Koerner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                    I'm sorry, because of -- because of what?                 But it was injured by the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the consumer's failure to pay the taxes.                    That is an intervening cause.                 Now, why shouldn't that be the end of the causation chain?                 You're suing him for setting up the ambiance?                 Does it -- does it affect your ambiance theory that the website has the language that your friend told us is on it, that you have to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from State to State or whatever the exact language is?                 That still creates the ambiance?                 Yes.                    Well, but the definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.                   Well, but that's because in every one of those cases, or at least in many of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and we're faithful to that intent. But I guess, as I tried to point out earlier, this is a different question.                 This is the usual judicial application of concepts of proximate cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate cause question.                  No -- I don't understand that.    The injury is directly caused by the consumers who don't pay the taxes.                   So it's a mail order house and they put a little line on it, says:                  By the way, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes. Then they're also subject to RICO prosecution?                   To whom was the permanent misrepresentation made?                 I don't want silence to be interpreted as acquiescence, but --                 Yes.                 Just to get back at maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which is you're focusing on -- you keep saying:                  The whole purpose of this, look at their website. But the issue is proximate cause, and if you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's either proximate cause or not.              And if the -- if the indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem to me that their intent is pertinent.
08-970 +++$+++                    Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                I will let you answer your second point, but just on that, I don't understand the concept of extraordinary success or results obtained.   The results that are obtained are presumably the results that are dictated or command or required under the law.     And it's not like, well, you had a really good attorney, so I'm going to say the law means this, which gives you a lot more, but if you had a bad attorney I would say the law has this and so he doesn't get a multiplier. The results obtained under our theory should be what the law requires, and not different results because you have different lawyers.                   Well, but what does a judge say when he said, you have achieved extraordinary results?       That if you weren't there, I would have made a mistake on the law?                   Well, I guess that's saying the same thing I said, which if it weren't for how good you are, I would have made a mistake.                 Maybe we have a different perspective.       You think the lawyers are responsible for a good result, and I think the judges are. (Laughter.)                Counsel, this lawyer -- I'm sorry, this judge said they were extraordinarily good, but, I mean, where's the cutoff?                 If the judge said, this is in the top 10 lawyers I ve ever seen, or the top 20, where do you get an enhancement and where do you not?                Yes, that's the thing.     It's hard to tell.                Well, for 28 years -- the judge was on the bench 28 years, right? Well, if you are in the top 28, is that a rare case or not?    It's once a year.                I know, but we are trying --                We are trying to establish a principle, and other judges are going to have to follow this.    And do they think, well, this was really good, but it wasn't as good as that law firm or lawyers we had 3 years ago; they were really good.                But how does he or she know that that -- that may be as good as it gets, for the next 28 years? (Laughter.)                There is a flip side to the unpopular case situation the S.G. talked about, which is lawyers and law firms sometimes take on a particular high-profile case to increase their profile, and they would have done it for a lot less. We have lawyers who argue here, who are doing it for free, because it's a big deal to be recognized as doing something in the Supreme Court.                  So when you use prevailing rates with respect to that type of work, you are overcompensating them.                Well, it's also not the term Congress used.                   I want to resort to what Congress said, which was --                Oh, I think it does.   I think rates are set with -- based on a law firm's record of -- I mean, just because you bill a client doesn't mean that they are going to pay or that they are going to pay at what you billed them.                And I think the rates are set to take into account that over the past year whatever you have a realization rate of -- whatever, 80 percent or 85 percent.                 Well, but there -- general counsel do that all the time when they get a bill from a law firm.   They cut it down.             They say you spent -- you ve spent too much time with this associate only because he or she is a first-year associate and is learning and training; I'm not going to pay for that.                So it's the same-- it's the same thing that happens when a district court looks at the -- the lodestar and cuts it down.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                You force people to challenge the practice when they don't even know if it's going to affect them.       In the hypothetical that has been discussed, somebody who didn't graduate from high school, you know, wants to be something other than a firefighter.     But that doesn't work out, and then he says, well, now I want to be a firefighter.                And they say, well, you can't, because you didn't graduate from high school.                And I think your position is that, well, he should have filed that suit earlier, no?                Well, but what is the unlawful practice?                Just to follow up on Justice Alito's question, what if it were different? What if the letter said, look, you didn't get, you re not well qualified, but we really do expect to hire a lot more, so, you know, keep your fingers crossed.                 There s a good chance that you are going to be hired. And you say those people should have sued right then?                Well, that's kind of a bad policy, isn't it?        You re telling people who may probably not be injured at all -- you are saying, well, you still have to go into Federal court and sue.                Oh, sure.   No, I understand that, but, you know, let's say we think we are going to hire -- if the budget plan goes through, we think we re going to hire everybody else by -- in 4 months.    And you re saying, well, those people have to sue anyway because they are injured by the 4-month delay.                 Yes.                   You've got to -- I mean, you ve just got to take your -- get as good legal advice as you can and determine is it -- are we going to be in more trouble if we follow the test or more trouble if we -- if we take it down? People have to do that all the time.                 They look -- well, if I do this, I'm going to be in trouble; if I do this, I'm going to -- but I have got to decide what I should do.                Well, I'm sorry. Read in conjunction with the 300 -- you have got to finish that sentence at least, before --

He avoided judicial process, and you would have him be in the same position once he's captured and returned and captured and returned as he was before he escaped at all, right?                  And you think that -- and you don't think -- you think you can argue that a State rule saying, look, if you escape and flee the jurisdiction, you bar -- your claims cannot be adequate and independent?                  Counsel, following up on that, I'd like your answer to this question:                      Is a State procedural rule automatically inadequate and, therefore, unenforceable when the State rule is discretionary rather than mandatory?                   Automatically?                 So you agree --                 So you agree with the Petitioner's response to that question?                 Their point -- their question presented is, is it automatically inadequate because there is discretion? They say no, you say no.                 Well, but that was the same -- that was the position you took in your opposition to certiorari.                 And yet we nonetheless granted -- granted cert.                 Well, if some of us -- or I suppose if several of us -- think that that may have been or was what the Third Circuit said, would you have any objection to us vacating the opinion, explaining since you both agree that the rule is not automatically inadequate, make sure they understand that, and then they can proceed however they see fit?                   Right.    And that is -- your objection is that it wasn't fairly applied. Discretion was abused in this case, to borrow from the Federal law.     They didn't treat them the same.                 They should have treated them the same. But the question is whether the rule is automatically inadequate if there is discretion.                    You are arguing about how it was applied, which I guess means that it's not automatically inadequate because if they apply it the way you think it should be then it would be adequate.                  Maybe I did, too. (Laughter.)                  But the point is you are arguing about the application -- the exercise of discretion.     You say the one guy, Lewis, got the benefit of the rule; your guy didn't get the benefit of the rule; and that's unfair, right?                  So you are not arguing -- which would be very odd to argue -- that the discretion always makes the rule invalid because you --                  Okay.                 Well, the problem -- Justice Stevens' question brought this up.                   I mean, how do you address that question if you don't have very many applications of the rule?                     Say it's the first one that comes up.                     Well, but your reasoned explanation --                 You don't doubt that it would be an independent and adequate State rule to say whenever anybody escapes they waive their claims?                  What is -- what is the Federal fugitive rule?                  Has discretion?                  Does the discretion that the Pennsylvania courts have here -- is that similar?     Can the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts exercise that discretion in a calibrated way, not all or nothing?                   Well, he got the windfall of being free for eight years, right?                    I guess that gets back to the point of your friend, which is he is in no worse position because he escaped and spent eight years on the lam than if he had stayed in prison.                   No, no.    Obviously if the State prevails he's in a worse position.                   But under your view, he's in this -- he's in no worse position.   He hasn't waived all his objections and claims, procedures.                 Well, I'm sorry, if I could just nail down the point.                As far as his rights and proceedings in this case, he is in no worse position under your theory having escaped and been out for eight years than if he had stayed put?                   Finish your sentence.

GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                   Why don't you follow his suggestion and just move the 6-month period, because the statute specifically grants that authority to the judge?                     Well, I think -- I think that's exactly right when you look at term "projected disposable income."                   But if you look as "disposable income" -                   -- as a defined term and then add "projected," I think it's a different - different -- different argument, different kettle of fish.    I mean, because particularly in a statute intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it. You look at it in the abstract, "projected disposable income," it doesn't achieve that objective.                   What if you -- you wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a definition of disposable income, and you wanted the court to -- you don't want to say project that forward, what -- what word would be more natural than saying projected?                   No, that's altering disposable income -- the definition of disposable income.   I'm asking isn't the most natural word to achieve your friend's result to use projected.                  What other word would you say when you say this is the period you look at and you want to take it forward?                     Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Harrington. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT                   It seems to me that, particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad - well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking into account a lot of things that are more properly taken into account when it comes to whether the plan should be confirmed or not.                   What's going to happen?   What's the situation going to be?                 What should, you know, the creditors get?            What should the debtor get?   There is no reason to kind of shoehorn those into the projected disposable income.                   Well, is that -- I mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say: Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before the filing.   So don't confirm it.                 We know she has got all this -- all this other money.                  That -- it could do it that way, couldn't it?                   Well, whatever the situation is, can't that be taken into account when it comes to confirmation?                   Well, the creditor has the option of objecting the confirmation of the plan.                   They can't say object because the 6-month period is unrepresentative because of this particular event?                   Does the government have a position on that?                   You can finish the sentence.                   Thank you, Ms. Harrington.

MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Of course -       Of course, in Bowles it was from an Article III court to another Article III court.     Here, although we're dealing with an Article I court, there are characteristics of what you might call internal agency review.     The court is specialized with respect to veterans' affairs, and there are particular standards for review that you don't find when you're talking about between the district court and the court of appeals.       I guess it's related -- just to get everything out on the table, it's related to the same point that I thought was significant in Bowles:     That you are dealing with a time limitation that lawyers had long recognized as being, you know, a drop-dead date.       And it made some sense.     I mean, when you look at the statistics, when you get into this court, the veterans almost always win, right?       My point was the exact opposite:     That if you -- if they almost always win, you assume that Congress wouldn't want to cut them off, because it's -- you know, if only 1 percent of the veterans appealing win, then you might understand an absolute rule, because they're not as -- statistically anyway, we're not losing much. But if, as I understand to be the case, about 80 percent of them win, you might cut them a little slack on appealing because it is a very significant part of the -- the process.       What -- what is the reversal rate?       Any idea what the normal rule is from district court to court of appeals?       No, what I -       I sense some confusion here, given what you and your friend have said.     What do you mean when you say "counseled"?     Do you mean --- I mean, if you have somebody from the American Legion that is telling this person here's what you need to do, does he get a notice, or are you talking about just the situation where somebody comes in and says, I'm -- well, I'm this person's lawyer, or I'm representing him in some other way?

KING ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, does the -       Does the analyst know whether he's being asked to do one for the prosecution or the defendant?

09-1088 +++$+++        Mr. Kennedy. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN K. KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       A finding under - under the standards that we've applied under AEDPA?       We have to determine under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to get a psychiatrist, or whatever his status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist said, look, there's nothing here, and he went through all the stuff that was there; and, in fact, after the Federal evidentiary hearing, he said, well, in light of this new evidence, I'm still correct; and objectively unreasonable for this lawyer to say, look, my best bet is to put his mother on the stand, that that might engender sympathy and portray him as not as bad a guy as everybody says, as opposed to putting on all this evidence that explains why he's such a bad guy.     Those are two -- we've said those are reasonable choices. If you're relying on that basis, we have to decide that it is objectively unreasonable for a lawyer to proceed on that basis.       Just to pause for a moment, you said there was no hearing in the State court.     Well, that was because the State court, pursuant to the established procedures, assumed everything you wanted to show was true.     It's a little bit much.     I mean, you were not going to be in any better position after a hearing than you were before the State court.       So you're putting your eggs in the basket that, under AEDPA, what happened here was objectively unreasonable?       Or do you want to go on and look at the question on which we granted cert and argue that we should look at the new evidence or that the State court should look at the new evidence?       Well, this -- your friend pointed it out, and I have to say it's a logical conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2) that the factual predicate could not have been previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer should have discovered this.     They both can't be true. And if the former is not true, you don't get a hearing; and if the latter is not true, you don't get relief.       When you say the State court -- you just told us that this was better off because it's only 6 hours, and you said in State court they did nothing; is that right?       When you say they did nothing, surely that was rhetorical hyperbole, and you took the 6 hours to say this proves what we said, they did nothing; they did next to nothing.     You're not saying, oh, well, it was 6 hours, so we're sorry we said they did nothing.       Well, that's -- that gets back to the point Justice Scalia was making, is that this is new evidence that the Ninth Circuit considered with respect to the original.     In other words, they were not just saying, okay, even if none of this happened, we'd still rule against you, because one of the new things they had was the 6-hour evidence, which you've just said makes your case stronger.     I think it does make your case stronger, but it also makes clear that we can't say let's just look -- the Ninth Circuit just looked at what was there originally.       You're going back to arguing that you win under the original proceeding, and the question on which we granted cert -       -- shouldn't be addressed.       Okay.       How long does it take to read Dr. Stalberg's report that says I've looked at this, I've examined this, this, and this, and there's nothing here that's going to support a mental impairment theory?       Counsel, just to get back to (e)(2), what is specifically the factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered in this case?       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bilderback, you have 5 minutes remaining.

09-11311 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Marsh. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, but that's not -- 14 isn't very many.     And I assume the vast majority of these cases aren't litigated.       Well, I read your brief, and I was -- I read your brief and was surprised that when you're -- the list -- one of the things you talk about to show that is media reports.     You usually have a more concrete basis for -- for speculation than media reports.       Well, one of the -       Another word is "aggressive" in Begay, and that's where I have a little difficulty with your argument.     It seems to me, this is the exact opposite of aggressive.     He's running away. Certainly, the other option is to turn and confront, and he doesn't want to.     There's nothing aggressive about running away.       Well, that's the risk of violence, I understand that, and purposeful, which I guess everything is.     But those are the three words:     "purposeful, violent, and aggressive."     I'll give you purposeful, I'll give you violent, but aggressive?       I think you're two-thirds of the way home free. (Laughter.)       There's a difference.     The opposite of passive is active.     It's not aggressive.       This is active. He's running away, but -       What's the aggression?       I thought there was -- I don't know where -- I don't remember where it was from.     I thought there was a development of best police practices that you don't just chase people.     You know, if they're going 30 miles an hour over the speed limit through a school zone, that doesn't mean the police officer should do that.     You know, you call ahead, they put these strips on the road, whatever.       Doesn't whether it's aggressive or not depend upon how it happened?     I mean, it could be -- I mean, the flight puts in place the potential for -- for violence, I agree with that; but if somebody just, you know, jumps out between two cars while the fellow's fleeing, how has his conduct changed to aggressive?       It's not like he - it's not like he's aiming for the guy.     I mean, it's putting it in a dangerous situation.     It's purposeful. Again, I'll give you violent in the sense that it has that potential.     But he didn't want to hit the -- the person.       It's not aggression against the person.       Who's he aggressing against?     When someone sees the police and says I'm getting out of here and drives down the highway, say, at miles an hour, you know, 25 miles above the speed limit, who is he -- I'm sure it's not the right verb, but who is he aggressing against?       Well, no.     It's not that -   -- there's no specific target.     There's no target.     What this guy hopes is that nobody gets in his way.

How would that work?     If we determine this is not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would an as-applied challenge come about?       So you think you are home free under State law?

09-11556 +++$+++        Thank you, Ms. Schwarz. Ms. Halligan. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Do you -- is your position that they can do anything in terms of the search of a name?     Could they punch it into Google or something like that and find out a lot more than just what they have in their own possession?       I know -- I know it raises a different question, but you know, you keep saying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking about the name, but names are meaningless in the abstract.     It's not just that the officer wants to know what to call him.     It's what he wants to find out from the name.       And these days there's so many electronic databases, you can find out an awful lot just, you know, with the punch of a few - a few buttons.       No, but it's not limited to suggesting danger or whatever.     It's -- it can -- that may be what the officer on the scene is most interested in, of course, but once you get the guy's name you're interested in a lot of things.       Well, they're not suppressing the knowledge of somebody's identity.     All that -- what's being suppressed is the evidence of criminal activity that you derive from that.       You -- you make the point that these records are already in the government's possession.       I mean, isn't that true of everything that's available on any type of database?     Everything in Google or whatever the other search engines are is in the government's possession in the sense that they've got it; all they've got to do is identify it in their search, and they've got it.       Well, it can't make a difference on whose server it is, does it?       It is information that they can get if they have the correct way of searching it, which is here by name.       Are these things public records?     If I wanted to find out if you had been, you know, stopped for driving without a license, can I find that out?       Thank you, Ms. Halligan.       Mr. Shah. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE       Is everything that the government has access to through any database considered in the government's possession?       Well, you said -- as you phrased it, I thought it was in the government's possession.       Well, what's the difference?     In either case, they need some search term, and then they will get the answers.     I don't see why it makes a difference.       Well, what if -- I'm sorry, go ahead.       Well, what if it's in the -- the government of Colorado's possession, and they have an arrangement with New York that they will let them check their files to find out, you know, whatever it is, nationwide or something?     Does that - your argument apply to that?
09-1156 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Hacker. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       In response to Justice Alito, I heard you say something about a scientifically plausible link.       That seems to me to be a rather significant concession.     In other words, you're saying it's not simply the fact that some psychic would say something, that that is not sufficient, even if that has an impact on the market price, that there has to be some scientifically plausible link to the report.       So what protection is there at the summary judgment stage in response to allegations?     Because it doesn't have to be scientifically valid; it can be completely irrational. All you have to do is allege that, you know, if you had told this, the price would have gone down.     If you had told -- if you had disclosed this, the price would have gone down.     And the response from the company is, well, but this is just ridiculous; this is some guy in his garage who writes this out on -- on a -- you know, a piece of paper in -- in handwriting.     And the response is going to be, well, let's let the jury sort it out.       Well, you just told me that it would be enough if somebody says that there's a satanic, you know, impact on this, because a reasonable investor would say there are enough crazy people out there that this is going to affect the price.       So it matters whether -- I don't know what kind of product has particular satanic susceptibility - (Laughter.)       -- but I mean, are you saying it matters if it's something that -- that Satan's not going to be interested in?     I don't understand. (Laughter.)       I don't mean to be facetious, but your way of distinguishing the satanic product is that it depends on whether people who follow satanic cults are going to be interested or not.     I mean -       Okay.     So that -- I'm just trying to get your response to that.     You just talked again about credible scientists and all that, and you're putting those other things to one side. So even if you have your satanic problem, that is not enough.     And you can sit there and allege it would cause a drop of 30 percent in the stock price, and you should have let this know -- your answer is no, they don't have to let -- they don't have to disclose this because there is no scientific credible basis for the link that's alleged?       Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Shah. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       You would have - you just said they would have a duty to disclose.       I thought you earlier just said there's no affirmative duty to disclose; it only is based on what they say.       Right.       Is there any way that consideration of those factors would support a -- a summary judgment in favor of the pharmaceutical manufacturer, other than the fact of having an extremely poor lawyer drafting a complaint?     Anytime you have a variety of factors like that -       -- I think it's very difficult for the judge to say anything other than that's for the jury.       Yes.       No, no, I'm talking about -- I'm talking about materiality.     In other words -       -- based solely on -- in other words, you're saying if they say anything related, it's going to be enough -       -- whether it's a scientific basis or not.
09-1159 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Fleming. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Is there a reason that the Federal Government can't just say, from now on we're not going to give any money to Stanford or anybody else until they have an agreement making clear that the inventor is going to ensure sure that title rests with the university, which then triggers the Bayh-Dole Act?       So you have no problem -- I mean, Mr. Stewart is being careful for his client, but you're comfortable with the idea that the government could impose that, even though there's nothing in the statute that requires it, and even though somebody could argue that the statute's somewhat inconsistent with it, in the -- in the sense that it wants to promote commercialization.       Well, but the problem with -       Are you finished answering Justice Breyer?       But that might lead to the same thing that the Bayh-Dole Act was intended to get away from, which is a variety of different arrangements across the vast array of government agencies, because they will have differing degrees of interest, differing leverage with respect to what they insist on from the different contractors.       Do you -- are you aware of situations where the universities enter into different types of arrangements with different types of professors and researchers?       Presumably some of them have greater degree of leverage than others and can say:     Look, you've got to make sure I get this much of the royalties, and I'm only going to give you that much.       No, go ahead.       But it's just -       -- it's not just that there may or may not be an effective assignment. The problem is you may get together, you the inventor get together with the university and say, look, the one -- we share an interest in making sure none of this goes to the government.     Why would we want to do that?     So you make an arrangement. Your theory -- your theory is that whatever the contractor gets is what the government can get and nothing more, so the contractor and you work out a deal to make sure that the contractor doesn't get the invention or the patent, it just gets royalties.       And they're happy because they're -- the value of the patent is not diluted by the fact that the government is going to be doing something with it.       So at the end of the day, though, your theory is that Congress passed a law that could -- I guess this is Justice Breyer's point - be easily circumvented not only by the inventor but by the inventor and the contractor working together.       There's nothing inequitable about it.     It's a perfectly fair deal between the university and the inventor. Mr. Fleming:     In that event the government has all the remedies that Mr. Stewart was talking about. As a matter of leverage, it could take the patent by eminent domain, and just compensation might be quite low if in fact it has funded all of the research.       What are the obligations -- what are the obligations that the contractor undertakes?       All things -- all things that the government had and more under the prior system?       Thank you, Counsel.
09-1163 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Why?     If these -- if these maps are so sensitive as you suggested, why weren't they classified?       I'm sorry, I don't understand that.     It's different to classify when?       Well, surely, you classify documents that are shared outside the Federal Government?       Could you classify these maps after -- I mean, assume that you don't prevail, could you then classify these documents, preventing their release before they're released?       No, I mean, isn't it the case when a government agency has to go through its records in response to a FOIA request and comes upon records that would otherwise be disclosable, they can at that point say we're going to classify this so we don't have to disclose it.       It seems to me you're asking us to do your job.     You've got to go through these documents and say -- you're telling us how sensitive these are, and, therefore, it would harm the national interest if they had to be disclosed.       If that's true, you can classify them and -       -- instead of coming to us and saying you should torture the language in FOIA to allow us to determine that this is sensitive to the national interest and therefore shouldn't be disclosed.       I would have thought that the amendment to Exemption 7 really cut the other way.     They amended Exemption 7; they didn't amend Exemption 2.       To adopt more or less Crooker, right?       Yes.     Exactly, not this one.       For what level of classification?     I gather the investigation of the person is quite different depending upon what level you want, if you want to give -       The lower things below secret -       Are those sufficient classifications to prevent disclosure under FOIA?       What is it, sensitive?       And so, if you label something confidential, you don't have to disclose it under FOIA?       I'm sorry.     You wouldn't regard internal security procedures for computer systems as confidential?       And all of which you already have to review to compile the Vaughn index and to make sure there are not other exemptions that are applicable, right?     You don't just grab a bunch of files and turn them over.     You look at them before you release them under FOIA.       You don't have to go through everything.     You have to go through the material that is requested, and you go through that material already.       And it takes forever to get the documents. (Laughter.)       Right.
09-1205 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Beck. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. BECK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       But that's a very subjective decision whether the lawyer is -- right here.       -- whether the - the lawyer is adequate or not.     People have different views about what kind of lawyer they want, and I can see somebody who doesn't even know that this action is going on saying:     Well, I don't care if you think the lawyer is adequate.     I don't think he is.     Besides I wanted my, you know, brother-in-law to be the lawyer.       I was just going to say -- it's odd to say you're precluded.     The whole point is the basic principle that you're entitled to your day in court.     And you're saying, well, you're not entitled to your day in court if somebody else had a day in court and they had a good lawyer.
09-1227 +++$+++        Mr. MCAllister. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. MCALLISTER, AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF JUDGEMENT BELOW       Pretty harsh, if we're talking about prudential standing, to deny that to a criminal defendant, isn't it?       Well, why do we have to do that?     It -- it seems to me we've had a lot of discussion this morning about whether this is an enumerated powers claim or a Tenth Amendment claim. They really do kind of blend together, and it seems to me awfully difficult to put on a criminal defendant the responsibility to decide whether this is going to be an enumerated powers claim or this is going to be a Tenth Amendment claim.     The basic principles do kind of merge together, and why does it make -- again, why does it make that much of a difference and why do you put the burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or another, since I assume they can make pretty much all the same arguments under an enumerated powers -- under the enumerated powers clause -       In an enumerated powers argument.       Thank you, Mr. MCAllister.
09-1233 +++$+++        Mr. Specter. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD SPECTER ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES       Did -- I'm sorry. Let me just keep track here. The evidence was cut off when in 2008?       All right.     So -       You -- you don't dispute the statement I have -- it's in the response of the intervenors -- that between October 2006 and October 2010, the population of the adult facilities declined by 14,832 inmates?       But that's not what -- that is not what the three-judge district court determined.     The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act requires that court to give substantial weight to adverse impact on public safety.       And when -- and then it said to the State, look, you come up with a plan that gets you to 137.5 in 2 years.       The State did -       -- and the State did not say -- emphatically did not say this is not going to have an adverse impact on public safety.       If you follow the double negative there.     But -- and what the district court said -- it didn't examine that.     It said, well, we're sure the State's not going to do anything that has an adverse impact on public safety.     I'm looking at page 4a of the jurisdictional statement.       It said -- and so it did not make those determinations, but the PLRA requires it to determine that what it's ordering -- or at least give substantial weight to the public safety issue.     So isn't that a basis for overturning the remedy that's imposed here?       I thought you would. (Laughter.)       Did he want to do it within the 2-year period the district court ordered?       Right.     Right.     No, my -- my question is specifically with respect -       -- and I'd like an answer to that -       -- because I look at this record; I don't see that the district court did what was required by the Act with respect to the plan that it's ordering.       It just simply said, oh, we're sure -- I'm sure the State wouldn't do anything to hurt public safety -- after telling the State you've got to give me a plan in 2 years that gets to 137.5.       Well, they said we're sure, because -- but -       -- because we trust -- I'm just quoting from 4a -       "We trust that the State will comply with its duty to ensure public safety as it implements the constitutionally required reduction." The State is saying it cannot meet the 137.5 in 2 years without an adverse impact on public safety.       Right.       I think -       I think Justice Sotomayor has been patient.       Well, but I thought the -       Maybe you can answer.       Maybe you can answer, counsel, please.       Can I ask you a hypothetical question that I know is not your case?     But let's say you had the district court entering an order saying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years. That will, as a practical matter, result in the release of 40,000 prisoners.     The State comes back and makes a showing supported by experts saying, look, if you give us 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing any prisoners. Do you think it would violate the Prison Litigation Reform Act for the district court to say: No, I want this done in 2 years, not 4 years, and we'll just have to deal with the fact there are going to be 40,000 prisoners out on the streets.       Right.       I'm sorry.     I couldn't -- what was the first -       Seven-zero?       Counsel, one of the thing that concerns me about this type of institutional reform litigation -       -- is that the State is responsible for a lot of different things.       And what happens when you have this case, another district court ordering the State to take action with respect to environmental damage, another court saying, well, you've got to spend this much more on education for disabled, another court saying you've got to spend this much more on something else?     How does the State sort out its obligations? Does it say -       -- well, I'll spend more money to build prisons, but I'll violate this other district court order saying I have to spend more money to build water treatment plants?       -- and you want the State to say this is where I'm going to put my money.       But the point is it's a budget prioritization that the State has to go through -       -- every day, and now it's being transferred from the State legislature to Federal district courts throughout the State.       What I'm saying is that you have conflicting orders from different district courts telling them you've got to comply with the Constitution by spending 8 billion here; and another court saying, I've got another constitutional problem of my own, and you've got to spend 8 billion over there. What is the State supposed to do in that situation?

DRAKE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Although you're -       You're describing what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and the suggestion we've heard on the other side is that that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we, according to the other side, correct the State court's error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create exigent circumstances. So I -- I don't know that it's terribly relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard was.     That will be relevant depending, or not - depending on what our opinion says.       No, it's -- it's not at all.     The court said:     I don't care whether exigent circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not. The legal standard is antecedent to the application of the facts.       Oh, sure, there is. It was dismissed because the State supreme court held you can't bring this evidence in.     If we say, oh, yes, you can, then the issue becomes live again.       This is the argument you presented to us in the letter, right?       And yet, we nonetheless decided to have argument.       So maybe it would be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move on to the legal issue.       Where's -- no "Open up."     I thought you said earlier they said "Open up."       Is that after - after the exigent circumstances or the alleged exigent circumstances were presented?     And that's after they heard what they thought -- and I know you disagree - was the destruction of evidence.       It seems to me that you're trying to change the case.     I mean, this is not a case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry. My understanding is that the issue in the case is whether or not, after a request for entry, they can then base probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based on what they hear from behind the door. Now, I know you think that they -- whatever they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is whenever they knock on the door, "Police" or "Can we come in" or whatever, and then they hear that, the activity behind the door, they have reason and can - can enter. Now, what you're -- it seems to me what you're arguing is, well, they did something else.     They banged on the door, they yelled "Police"; it wasn't simply knocking on the door and seeking entry.     And you may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me that's for -- for later on. I want to know what your position is on whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and say "Can we come in" or knock and say "Police" -- no demand to get in.       So just assume, for my sake, that the police comes to the door.     It's not 10:00 at night; it's, you know, 6:00 at night.     Knocks quietly on the door and says "We're the police.     Can we talk?"     And then there was the smell of marijuana.     And then he hears the sounds that do convey to a reasonable police officer that evidence is being destroyed.     At that point can they enter without a warrant?       Okay.       You know -- you don't know what -       You don't know what "unlawful" means, but you know what "unreasonable" means.       What is -- what is an example of conduct that you would consider unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence that would not be unlawful?       Right.       So you can't - can't give me one example of some conduct that's unreasonable under your test that would not be unlawful?
09-1273 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, which way does that cut?     That seems to me to put an awful lot of power and authority in the hands of one beneficiary and one lawyer saying -- all they have to do is filing a suit saying, look, we get a hundred doses of Lipitor from this program; we think we should get less. And if they win, the whole country's -- the pricing of Lipitor under this program has changed.       That strikes me as an argument in favor of leaving the enforcement with the Secretary.       It doesn't have to be a class action, does it?       That's why it was brought as a class action?       That's Miree. That's 1977.     And a lot of your argument, it seems to me, is in the earlier world of implied right of action jurisprudence that has changed dramatically in the last years. And what concerns me is when you are talking about the same language, the mere fact that the government has decided to go through a contractual mechanism to advance this program doesn't allow you to use that to get an end run around all of the implied right of action jurisprudence of the last 30 years. You're on stronger ground before that.       Well, but that was pretty well -- that analysis was certainly consistent with the established jurisprudence in this area then. But it started changing very quickly thereafter -- I think about 1980 -- and then consistently went in the other direction, to the point now where I think the jurisprudence is pretty clear that we're not going to imply a private right of action at all.       But so do the - it's the same situation with the States under Spending Clause legislation.     They don't have to sign up, but if they do, then the issue is, is there an implied right of action on the beneficiaries?     And our cases for the last 25, 30 years have said no.
09-1279 +++$+++        Mr. Klineberg. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KLINEBERG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Do you think it's - how does that work?     If you have -- the president of the environmental organization says something about whatever it is -- we can lobby this guy to get this change -- is he able to protect that on the grounds of his personal privacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the -- the organization as a whole?       Well, why is it such a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to be protected?       No.     I mean you're -- you're already protected, at least to a significant extent, because the individual officers would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to the corporation is also individually embarrassing to them.       I mean, "pastor" - you have a "pastor" and "pastoral."     Same root, totally different. So I don't understand -- I don't think there's much to the argument that because "person" means one thing, "personal" has to be the same relation.
09-1298 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Phillips. General. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       We have -- we've gotten to this point in the dispute because you say they're at fault; they say you're at fault.     Under the state-secrets doctrine, we can't resolve that question. Why don't we call the whole thing off?     Nobody's at fault; that means it's terminated not for fault, but for convenience, and that's it.       Well, only because you altered the legal status quo -- the legal status quo is they're going along with their contract, and you altered it by holding them in default.       Isn't that -- isn't that the affirmative step with the contracting officer saying there's a default?       It's an affirmative step of the Federal Government.     He works for you, and he's the one changing the status quo.       I thought -       I'm sorry.     Do you want to give the cite?       Are you ever the -       Are you ever the moving party in the Court of Claims?       Well, on a counterclaim, but that obviously means somebody else is the moving party.     They've raised the claim.       If somebody wants to get money -- if somebody wants to get money from the Federal Government, they have to go to the Court of Claims, right?       So this is a pretty convenient rule for you, right? (Laughter.)       Justice Kennedy -       And now Justice Sotomayor.       How would you write -- you keep saying these are sophisticated parties. What would the contractual term look like that would avoid this problem?       Do you think your client would ever agree to something like that?       Yes.       So how do they write the contract?     If they -- your answer can't be the only way they can write it is a way that you'd never accept. So how -- how do you contract around this problem?       This wouldn't be a problem in an alternative dispute resolution because that's not a court?       So you get the extra money without having to go to court because then they'd have to go to court and challenge your offset?
09-1343 +++$+++        Thank you. Mr. Ross. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. ROSS, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       What if he said we want to do that, but we don't like New Jersey, so don't sell our products in New Jersey, and the Ohio company nonetheless does so?     Can you get them -- can you hale them into court in New Jersey?       But he said have no intention of selling in New Jersey; I'm afraid I might get sued there, and I don't want to get sued there.     He is not entering the stream of commerce in the United States.     He's entering a stream of commerce that detours around New Jersey.       Yes.       Oh, it would be excluded?       So it depends on the intent of the manufacturer?       Maybe you could respond to Justice Breyer's -       What difference does it make that they go to a trade show somewhere other than New Jersey?     We have the notion that they're availing themselves of the -- the entire United States market.     That's -- I'll accept that.       What does the trade show in Nevada add to the jurisdictional ties to New Jersey?       With Nevada?       What if there is no scrap metal plant in Montana?     Can Montana be a jurisdiction in a case like this?     You know, a Montana worker is over in New Jersey and comes back to his home in Montana, and he's been injured.     Do they avail themselves of the market in Montana when there's no market for their products there?       No, no.     He's just injured by one of the machines somewhere else, but he's from Montana.     Can he sue in Montana?       Well, I thought -- I thought this was what the case was all about:     whether this is -- the stream of commerce is sufficient to add a basis on top of the plaintiff's residence.       And I would have thought -- to me, that's a significant limitation on your theory to say that in areas where you don't expect to be haled into court because your machine is not going to be used, you can't be.       Yes.       No, no.     Not the machine.       Yes.       Yes.       Yes, exactly.       Could it be put elsewhere?     Could it be put in the other State?       Right.       Right.       Yes.       Well, better -- I know -- I know you think it's better, but can he be sued in Montana? What I'm trying to get at, obviously, is we're talking about the stream of commerce in the United States, but the stream doesn't wash over the United States evenly.     The manufacturer, as I asked earlier, may decide I don't want to sell New Jersey.       The manufacturer may reasonably assume his machines aren't going to be in Montana because there's no scrap metal business in Montana.     So I'm just trying to see if there are limitations to your theory about the stream of commerce covers everything.       Right, but the market cannot be simply the United States, because you carve out New Jersey if the manufacturer does, you carve       Okay.       Well, what if -       Let's say he does know, it's a component part for something that is sold, widely sold, in the United States.     Or it's a component part of this machine.       But why would it be -       So you have an entirely different test.       You have -- you have an entirely different test for a component manufacturer than you do for the finished product manufacturer.     The component manufacturer may well know to a certainty that his component is going to be used in a product that's sold in the United States. Let's say he makes a component for this machine.       Why is that different?     Shouldn't it be the same test?       He makes -- let's say he makes the 25-inch blade that only goes into this machine.     That's the only market for it.     Does -- no difference?       I'm sorry.     That was poorly phrased.     Is it the same test for the machine, or is it a different test?     Is it your component test?       How can there not - how can there possibly not be purposeful availment if the manufacturer of the 25-inch blade knows it's only going to be used in MCIntyre's machine and it knows that MCIntyre is trying to sell its machine in the United States?       He put it in a product that is only going to be -- that he knows is going to be sold in the United States.       You have a partnership.     One of the partners makes the shell of the machine; the other partner makes the insides of the machine.     Are they, as individual companies -- are they availing themselves of the United States market?       Can -- maybe everybody knows this except me.     Do you -- are Web sites targeted to the United States?     Don't you -- you can - let's say they put it on their Web site in England. Can't you -- can't -- can't I access that from here?       So they don't even have to send the Web site to the United States?     They just have to have a Web site?       So it has to be interactive?       If it's just -- what if it says, here, we're MCIntyre -- on a Web site -- we make these machines; give us a call at this number if you want to buy one?       Not enough?       And this distinction is somewhere in the Due Process Clause?       Complete?     He's got to complete the transaction?       What if it's -       -- you know, punch these numbers, and we will send you an application for a machine?     Is that not enough, because he's got to complete the transaction?       So that if they say fill this out, and contact this person, MCIntyre, whatever, in Ohio, that's where you can get one of our machines -- that's enough?       Would their - 
09-1403 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Sterling. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID STERLING ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Counsel, I suppose if you prevail and a defendant tries to establish at the certification stage that there's no loss causation and loses, then that's law of the case and you've missed the three opportunities that Mr. Boies was willing to give you at the pleading stage, summary judgment, and the merits.     That issue is out of the case if you lose, right?       What if there's no -- no new evidence?     One of the objections to your theory is you don't have discovery at the certification stage.     What if you have no new evidence to put on at later stages?       No, no, no.     You - on page 13 of your brief you say one of the objections to it -- to your opponents or your friends' view is that it would just postpone the defendant's ability to rebut the presumption, result in countless classes being certified with the certain knowledge that they would have to be decertified later.     Well, if it's so certain, then there's no in terrorem effect.
09-1454 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kubitschek. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN A. KUBITSCHEK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       You're not challenging the qualified immunity ruling?       Yet, you have - yet, you have -- why didn't you just go away? (Laughter.)       I do know that.     But on the other hand, you had no -- you could have filed a paper saying we have no continuing interest in the case, but you haven't done that.     You've fought the legal issues on the merits in -- in an area where it's been suggested you don't have a stake.       So you have objection if we entered a Munsingwear order vacating the decision of the Ninth Circuit on the merits of the dispute?       Well, again -       I'm sorry.     Again, I get to the question, why do you care?     Why do you care whether we vacate the -- the order or not?     Your position is your client has no continuing interest in the case.       He was not trying to help you. (Laughter.)       So you're -       So that's your argument, again, that we shouldn't reach the merits?       Now, do you agree that if we vacate the court of appeals' decision on the merits, that if Camreta had did exactly what he did in this case again, that he would not face personal liability?       Right.     Then that cannot be used -- that cannot be used to establish that there's clearly established law.     And in the absence of clearly established law, he cannot be found personally liable?       So if he did exactly the same thing, he would still be entitled to qualified immunity?       But who is -- who is on the other side of the county?       The claim pending below involves which two parties?       Oh.     So -       Does the decision on the merits here have any relevance whatever to the action that's still pending?       So you agree that if -- if this is -- we vacate the decision on the merits, that's of no meaning whatever in the pending action below?       If you're making an argument on something that you've already told us you have no cognizable interest in -- correct?       Thank you, counsel.
09-1476 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       But all of our cases have equated the Petition Clause reach with that of the First Amendment, and our cases under the First Amendment have made clear that we don't want to constitutionalize the -- the employee grievance procedures.       Does the Petition Clause cover anything that the First Amendment does not?       Well, getting back to the second part of my question -       -- in the First Amendment cases we were concerned about, as I said, constitutionalizing employee grievances.     If you constitutionalize it under the Petition Clause, how is that any less a problem of constitutionalizing it under the First Amendment?       All you have to do then is add a sentence to your complaint saying:     This is an example of how the government employer mistreats its employees?       And then it becomes more generalized?       But -- but that's the basis of our law in this area is that when the government is actually the employer the rights of the individuals are somewhat different, and they're closer to the rights that private employees have.     So simply saying that these constitutional provisions apply against the government and therefore, you don't have to worry about the distinction between private employers and government employers doesn't seem to be -- me to be completely responsive to our precedent.       Well, but things will be a lot different if we give the sanction to your theory.     I think the idea that it hasn't happened in 17 years in the wake of San Filippo is a little bit -- it's not very compelling.       Well, but the most likely solution when you have an employee grievance along with it is that some umbrella settlement -- I mean, the employer doesn't want to spend -- I mean, that's part of the reason our doctrine developed under the First Amendment.     The employer doesn't want to have to worry about spending time and money in court to resolve what is essentially an employee grievance.

FISHER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT       And if we don't agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we would have to reach this third argument, right?       I'm sorry to interrupt you so early, but what about Justice Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's just that the district judge takes that into account, says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at this point. So that is delay, when the trial date might otherwise have been set, resulting from these pretrial motions, and then the -- the statute goes on to tell you how you count that delay.
09-150 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Van Hoek. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER JON VAN HOEK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Now is a good time to try to jump in, I think. (Laughter.)       So what do you do - what do you do with the statement the guy in the gas station shot me?     Is that purely past, or is that an ongoing emergency?       Even though the guy in the gas station is still there with a gun, the police are within range?       Yes.     I mean, that strikes me as something that happened in the past, he shot me, but at the same time demonstrates an ongoing emergency because he's right there and he might shoot you.     I'm suggesting the line you propose to Justice Alito doesn't work.       No relation.       Oh, sure it can.     If he says the principal did it.     It's -- it's 10 o'clock in the morning; you assume the principal is at the school; and he says the principal did it.     You can infer from the circumstances that he's referring to an ongoing emergency.       Well, it's quite different than saying, you know, this happened to some guy driving by, or something like that.     If he says the principal did it, it's at 10 o'clock, it's in the school -- that suggests to me more, not that the dying student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that the principal was convicted, but that there's an emergency, something is happening.       Oh, no, no.     You don't want them to have to go through, you know, a whole list of questions while the student's there dying and the principal is inside the building shooting people?

Thank you, Ms. Sullivan.       Mr. Horwich. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       So it doesn't make a determination that the one that they are listing in their morbidity report is better than one that's out there?     This is a situation where there were two of them out there.       Well, the comparison between the vaccine that caused the harm and the one that Mr. Frederick's client says was more efficacious and therefore the harms were avoidable.       There must be a situation where the Centers for Disease Control approve, alert people to the fact that there is a particular vaccine that they think manufacturers should -- should produce, and there is another vaccine addressed to the same disease already on the market.     That's never the case?     They must improve the vaccine -       -- or we wouldn't have this case.       When they publish that information in their weekly report, do they compare it both with respect to losses or mortality and with respect to efficiency, with -- to the other vaccines on the market.       It has not only given that information; it has also said in its weekly report that this is the one we want you to make.       Thank you, counsel.       Sure.       Thank you, counsel.

I think a reasonable judge might decide:        Look, if I can dispose of this case on ground one, you know, why should I go and decide all these other issues, which may be difficult?                   Yes.   And so I assume your point is that he can raise -- he can raise again issues that he raised before; it's no fault of his that the Court didn't reach -                     It's not the whole case.

Paragraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines because -- saying they owned, operated, managed, supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger vessel.   And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as for Costa Crociere, right?                  Okay.     So that lawyer looks at this and says:                Aha, they made a mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name in Italian.     So I'm going to wait until the statute of limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm going to say aha.                    No, I would have said the previous paragraph, 9, says:                     "The plaintiff has complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the passenger ticket."      So you know they read the ticket.                    Now, which is it? Is that a Freudian slip? (Laughter.)                    Just a mistake. (Laughter.)

You ought to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't.                  Do people usually - in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown between prosecution and defense on a question like this? My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to continue, because all they need is, you` know, one holdout.                  If the jury is hopelessly deadlocked, is there a situation where that would not constitute manifest necessity?                  So it does get back to the factual determination of deadlock, correct?                   So the -- so the proposition that what happened here is an abuse of discretion cannot be said to be clearly established, right?                  You don't have anything like this case that says this would be an abuse of discretion?                  So the fact that it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly established by the decisions of this Court.                   I thought you answered an earlier question that I asked -- maybe I'm -- maybe it was something I asked your friend, although I doubt it, since it would help him -- that the issue did come down to the factual determination of deadlock, because if there is deadlock then there is manifest necessity.                   Right.    So the case comes down to whether or not this is a case of genuine deadlock, right?                  With the layers - with the two layers of deference worked into your formulation.     It's not simply whether the trial court erred in the determination that there was a deadlock that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial judge to so determine that we review under an additional abuse of discretion standard.                  Doesn't our law clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden, hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer to the case?                    What -- what -- I'm sorry.   Please finish your sentence.                  Okay.   What other explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too loud," other than that there was some degree of acrimony on the jury?                    No, you don't dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we being too loud?                  Well, what would that indicate other than that there was some degree of acrimony?                     So you -- you do agree that there could be situations where a Federal court on direct review would find abuse of discretion, and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that that has to stand?                     So there are a category of cases where a Federal court could look at it and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not entitled to relief under AEDPA?                  How can you say that?   I mean, you may think the discretion was abused, but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was going to be a mistrial.        He exercised discretion.              He looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are you hopelessly deadlocked?           Are you going to be able to reach a unanimous verdict? And he was able to rely on the fact that they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in which there were 10 hours of testimony. I mean, I understand your argument that he abused his discretion, but I don't understand the argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.                    No, she asked the foreperson a question.                    Where did -- where did -- I'm sorry.      Where did she conflate the two things you said she conflated, deadlocked and the other thing? What was it, inability to -                    Well, but you got to read down further.      She says:           "Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not?"             And the foreperson says "No."                     Well, just -- with respect, it's not the very first sign of disagreement. Reasonably interpreting, a note saying "Are we being too loud" is a sign of disagreement.                 And there is another note that comes out:        "What happens if we can't agree?" You are making it sound more precipitous than it was.                   Oh, no, no.   I'm sorry.                  There is not a period on page 7 of the Petitioner's brief.                   Is that a mistake?   There's a -                  -- dash.    And -- and could the court be concerned that the person was about to say, and again with deference to the court, "The majority -- majority of us don't believe that" -- that the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent. Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?                  Isn't that exactly what she did?   After that he says don't tell me what you are going to -- or don't tell me what you are going to say.   I don't want to know what your verdict might be or how the split is or anything like that, are you going to reach a unanimous verdict?           She did go on after that -                  How -- how do you know she answered for herself?              The judge was talking - she can't reach a unanimous verdict by herself.                 She is answering for the jury.
09-350 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pincus. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       So that's what you think.     So you agree -- it struck me that your argument could have been made by your friend on the other side. You say if you get an injunction, you must have shown municipal policy, practice, or custom.     And, therefore, you agree that a municipal policy, custom, or practice is required.     That's what he thinks.       Well, Monell doesn't apply to State officials, right?       Thank you.       That, of course, isn't before us.       Well, that would require -- that would require us to get into the question of whether Ex parte Young is a fiction or substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into.       Justice Breyer's question said you need a city policy, and you said that's exactly right.     So I think the case is over.     The issue is whether you need a city policy, and your friend thinks so, and you think so.       But you don't think that -       I think your friend agrees.     But -- but how can the city have caused the violation in the absence of a city policy, custom, or practice? You say you have to show causation to get an injunction.     The only way to show that the city caused the problem is to show that they've got a policy, custom, or practice, including one that might be shown by inaction.     But you still have to show that, and that's all Monell requires.       Well, now you're arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you're going to get a chance to do that on remand because the Ninth Circuit said we're -- we're making the city pay, and now we're going to find out if they violated anything.       So -- so the Ninth Circuit was wrong to send it back for a hearing?       Because you've already shown Monell was satisfied.       -- but -- yes, damages, but turning on whether Monell was satisfied. It was a hearing about Monell.       Go ahead.       How can you get relief -- how can you get relief going forward under Monell unless there has been a city violation before? Otherwise what the injunction you're getting is just an injunction saying don't violate the law, and the city has said we haven't because you haven't shown that we had policy, practice, or custom.       If you were sued -       No, I -       I'm sorry -- answer.       Well, but it's not -- defending the suit doesn't give rise to a municipal custom, policy, or practice.     They may have - somebody comes in and says this is what's going on.     And they say, well, we don't -- we don't think that's unconstitutional.     So they're going to defend the suit. That doesn't mean that they have adopted a policy to do what they -- the individual employee has been alleged to have done.       Well -- or continuing to do, I mean, the suit doesn't satisfy the requirement of showing a policy or practice, because they may defend on the ground that it's not unconstitutional.     They may say, look, this isn't our policy, this isn't our practice, but we're going to defend our employee because we don't think it's unconstitutional.       No, but -       And so the city -       The city is in a catch-22 position.     Whenever they are sued, they have to say if we defend this, we're going to be liable under Monell, but if we don't defend it, then, you know, our policy is being changed.     Or we might -- we might want to have this policy; we might not.     We didn't know this clerk was doing that, but we might think it's a good idea, we might think it's a bad idea. The cases are not always going to be as clear as the hypotheticals in your -- in your brief.     It seems to me that it's a bit much to tell the city you've got to choose -- when you have to choose whether to defend a suit, you are in fact choosing what policy or practice to have going forward.       Well, he doesn't get relief against the city because the city is not responsible for what happened until they adopt a policy, practice, or custom. Now, if they are told this is unconstitutional and they decide to stick with it, then they're -- then that's their policy and custom, and you can get an injunction against them.       He's not -- he's not entitled -       He's not entitled to prospective relief against the city because the city has not caused the alleged harm until you establish a policy, practice or custom.       If you establish what the employee is doing in a suit against the employee, which the city is defending because he's one of their employees, then the city is put to a choice. Once -- I suppose once the legal process has concluded, they have to decide whether to continue that or not.       What I'm trying to figure out the answer to is whether or not merely defending the employee in court is sufficient to establish that the city has that policy, custom, or practice.       Oh, sure.     Sure.       So you're back where Justice -- Justice Alito was commenting, well, that at some point you have to bring what you're complaining about to the attention of the city.     And you dismiss that as an exhaustion requirement, but -       Thank you, counsel.
09-367 +++$+++                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Heytens. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                     Well, the consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts make errors, which is to appeal.                  Counsel, let's -- let's suppose there s no 3664(d)(5), and we re back to just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant, the court shall order restitution.                  What if the judge doesn't -- is that mandatory?                     It has to be when sentencing the defendant?                   So you think even without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say:                    I know it says when I'm sentencing I ve got to order restitution. But 2 months later, he can do it?                   Yes, but nothing happens if he doesn't.       Is that --                  So a -- a defendant who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides, that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck, right?                     So, your argument is not to exceed 90 days  means the same thing as  without undue delay ?
09-400 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Davis. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY G. DAVIS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, before you - how is that consistent with the statutory language that requires that this discrimination simply be a motivating factor?       Well, I'm sorry. The statute says is a motivating -- one of those four things, membership, application, et cetera, is a motivating factor in the action.       And I understood your position to be that the supervisor has to have such dominant control that it's the "cat's paw."       Yes.       Well, I guess where I'm having trouble following you is the total domination motivating factor.     It seems like a much more stringent test that the Seventh Circuit has adopted.       Thank you, Mr. Davis. Mr. Schnapper, you have 4 minutes remaining.
09-448 +++$+++                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS Q. ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  Counsel, what is the impact on your position of our decision last week in Conkright v. Frommert?       I know you haven't had a chance to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.                  I would have thought that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending it back rather than making a judicial decision, which -- which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in most cases, the person would prevail before the plan administrator. So given Conkright, your position is going to severely limit the circumstances under which claimants are entitled to fees.                   Even though the -- as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before an agreement, can be quite dramatic.                    This was a very, very significant victory for the claimant to get it sent back under those circumstances.                    -- and would say, and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says: Look, I don't know if you re going to prevail or not on remand.   My decision actually doesn't help you much one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume you ll be able to work out the amount.                    If you don't, he's done.   End of case.          Sent back to the administrator.                   What if the parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case rises or falls on the discovery issue?                    If we have to go through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than to pay you.   So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on discovery will decide the issue. In that case, can the party -- can the claimant get fees?                  Well, it grants the discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that ruling, the plan pays benefits.
09-475 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Robbins. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  So if the injunction doesn't do anything, why are you bothering to defend it?                  Just -- I'm sorry to interrupt.     Just from the seeds blowing in the wind?                  But that -- there's a flip side of that that is not so good for you, because one of the things you want from the injunction is a prohibition on the agency partially deregulating.                 Well, you re not entitled to that, because the vacatur sends it -- should send it back to the agency and they can decide.   And if they decide to partially deregulate, you have the APA challenges available to you.                  So your argument is that the district court judge made a mistake in mixing up the vacatur and the injunction?                  I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but they ve already done an EA in support of total deregulation, presumably, and they found no adverse -- presumably, that would be a fortiori for partial.                  Could I go back to something you said a while ago, that "likely" does not mean more likely than not?                  It's -- I thought that would be obvious.       If I say your friends are likely to win, that means they are more likely than you.                   Do you have -- I -- I was surprised that this apparently hasn't been decided over the however many years we ve had this standard. Is there a case that says "likely" does not mean more likely than not?                  And that's a decision for the government to decide, APHIS, and their lawyer, Mr. Stewart, who is in the courtroom told us what the APHIS view is.                  All arguments you can make before HP -- APHIS and which presumably were made before APHIS --                  -- and can be made before APHIS if this is remanded.                  It doesn't entitle you to an order saying APHIS can't do anything in the meantime.                  Well, it's kind of artificial to separate the two out.                 I mean, it's one judgment, and they say they re intertwined.                 The injunction is based on the vacatur.                 And so if they challenge the injunction, you can't say, well, they re not challenging the vacatur.                   Well, but we have to decide -- for you to prevail on that, we have to decide that the injunction does no more than the vacatur.                   So -- so the district judge was wrong.           He should have -- if you say the injunction adds nothing to the vacatur, he should have ended by saying it's vacated.                   If you're -- if you are right that the injunction does nothing, they don't have standing because of that, we should throw the injunction out.                    We don't have to worry --                    The government doesn't have to worry about standing, does it?                  Thank you, counsel.
09-479 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. MCLeese. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. MCLEESE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       But that's not -- I can't imagine a single district judge getting that wrong.     To think that, oh, my gosh, here it says 10 years if you discharge the firearms, and here it says 5 years if you have one, which one do I use in a case when it's discharged?       You don't need this provision, the -- your argument can't be that this language is to make sure the district judge knows in that case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year.       Well, I would have -- I guess things are obvious to different people.     I would have thought it would be odd to say when there are increased minimums that the highest minimum applicable isn't the one that applies.       But your main -- the meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right?     There is this significant provision out there that does provide a greater mandatory minimum.     And I just don't see, as a practical matter, why people would worry about that.     Under 3559(c), you get life.     And you're saying, well, they put in the "except" clause to be sure that the judge would add another 5 years at the end of a life sentence.       Yes, exactly.     Yes, I'm sorry.       Okay.     Well, just so I make sure I understand, the basic point you're making is that there are some things under your reading that this deals with.     One is the internal point, and we can disagree as to whether that's necessary or not, and the other is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make any difference whether you're in there for life or life and the additional 5 years.       But that's a difficult -- you're saying, because Congress wanted to get tough on the people who use firearms in this provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant?       So, with respect to 3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not stricter, right?       I thought you said earlier that the purpose of this, what it does, is it makes sure that you don't add 5 extra years on the people who are sentenced to life.       Which is right. You're saying when you get life, or you get 5, just serve life; don't serve the extra 5.       Is there any evidence in the legislative history that the reason they put this in was to ensure that people who got life would not get life plus 5 years?       No, it seems to me the perfectly natural reading is to say, look, we are providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you have already got a higher sentence for the violent crime, then this doesn't apply.       As Justice -- as Justice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into account in figuring out what sentence he would want to impose beyond the greater minimum.
09-497 +++$+++                     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Silverberg. ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN E. SILVERBERG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                  I would have thought the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and some are not.     The issue would be whether there is unconscionability in the making of the whole contract. In other words, it's the same question I asked your friend:     Why isn't it all or nothing?                  If it was -- if there was no unconscionability in the making, then the arbitrator decides.       If there was unconscionability in the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide anything.     Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know, 1, 8, and 9.                  No, my point is that once you get past that gateway question of whether the formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then claims that particular provisions were unconscionable are by definition for the arbitrator to decide.                  I thought your --               No, that can't be right.   The -- how can you say there's no problem agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these procedures are unconscionable? It seems to me that the procedures are there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look at those.   And if he says, well, that's unconscionable, you don't sign the agreement as a whole.                    But once you are -- in for a penny, in for a pound.                    If you agree to arbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to decide particular provisions, whether they re unconscionable.                     I know you re arguing in the alternative.                 But the one argument that we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole is not -- that seems to me illogical.                     Well, it's a matter -- it may be a matter of State law, but the open question is who gets to decide it.                     Arbitrators decide matters of State law all the time.                  Does it make a difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will decide the conscionability of all clauses?                 The arbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are unconscionable, but if there s an agreement and it's not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then the arbitrator decides all of them, right?                  Right.                  Can I ask you just a follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where he had the first agreement and then the issue to the second?   You said you ve got to leave the door open. The door open on the second agreement or on the first agreement?
09-520 +++$+++        Thank you, Counsel. General Maze. ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, you can single out the railroads through exemptions.     I mean, let's say you have a tax of $1,000 per mile per day for anything that uses a thoroughfare in the State.     However, things that use roads, waterways, you know, the long list that in effect leaves only the railroads exposed. You are saying that can't be regarded as a tax that discriminates against the railroads?       Okay.     So what if there's only two that pay it?     Only -- and it applies only to railroads and bicycles?       We can determine that a tax is not generally applicable based on the exemptions.     If everybody else is exempt, well, it's not generally applicable.     If just bicycles are also exempt, then it is not generally applicable.     We have to look at the exemptions to decide whether there is discrimination.       I'm sorry.     Just so I follow:     And that test says what?       I'm sure I'm just repeating myself here.     So that it doesn't single it out if there's one additional business or line of business subject to the tax, no matter how small that exemption is?       Right.       Exactly.     So the Court has to decide, even when you are dealing with exemptions, whether or not that discriminates against the railroad?       If I'm right, that means you lose the case -       -- at least as the question presented has been addressed, because all we are deciding -- I understand you think we ought to decide more, but all we are deciding is:     Can (b)(4) ever come into play when the discrimination arises from an exemption?       That's what railroads do.       But it still doesn't get to the question that in courts in each particular case will be able to decide, even under your test, whether it singles out railroads. The only question I have is that whether singling out means railroads have to be the only business subject to it, or if it has to be, you know, some theory -- Justice Kennedy was looking for a test. I don't know if we have got a workable one -- to decide when it's really discriminating against the railroad and when it's that the exceptions are just the way taxes normally work.       Do you think section 11501(c) is relevant to all these disputes, because one thing 11501(c) does is give the State a little bit of a break?       They recognize that it is hard to have exact equality in terms of ad valorem property assessment.     So, what does -- what does it say -- you know, a 5 percent legal room.       Couldn't you, if we rule against you, when you get back and other State officials say, look, the one thing we don't have to worry about is being precise.     We have got some legal room, so we can exempt the 85-year-old widow, we can, you know, exempt the farm property.     We just kind of have to get it close so that if somebody looks at it, and they'll say, well, it doesn't really look like they are discriminating against railroads, why isn't that pertinent and why doesn't it respond to a lot of your concerns?       No, I know.     I'm using that not as saying that this is applicable to (b)(4), but that it gives you an idea that Congress didn't have the precise absolute rule, and you go one, you know, 1 inch over the line and you are in trouble.       It clearly -- it clearly applies to (b)(1) through (3) and has got nothing to do with (b)(4) because it can't apply to (b)(4).       (b)(4) is not a - (b)(4), the whole point is if it's not a property tax, you don't have ad valorem assessments, so the details limiting jurisdiction when you do have ad valorem taxes don't apply to this case at all.       Thank you counsel.

Please -       Except -- except when they review material going in the prospectus.       Then they have independent representation by outside counsel.       I don't understand -- I don't understand your answer.     The outside counsel reviews what the policy is going to be.       Our question is the validity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in the prospectus.     That seems to me to be an entirely different question.     I understood your theory of the case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they put it in the prospectus.       Well, that's the question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg the question -- is that they falsely represented.     The issue is whether or not something happened between their drafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the trust rather than a statement of JCM.       I'm sorry to interrupt, but it seems be an important -- when they issued the prospectus -       Who issued the prospectus?       And the SEC has recognized that they remain two separate entities, despite this interconnected relationship.       The one -- the one activity -       The one activity that we know they did not outsource was review of the materials submitted by JCM.     They had independent counsel that conducted that review. Would it have been a breach of the trustees' fiduciary obligations to the fund investors under common law -- I forget where this is incorporated -- to rubber-stamp what they get from somebody on the outside, not to have independent counsel review what they're going to say in their prospectus?       Well, it seems to me -       Isn't -- isn't that, again, what has been conceded:     That there may well be an action from the fund represented by their trustees against -       Except -- except to the SEC, right?     Because they can pursue it under aiding and abetting.     It's kind of a big -       -- problem if you're trying to say we're safe from actions for security fraud.       Well, I know, but you were just responding by saying the problem is that this will give people a road map.     But they're going to hit a pretty big bump in the road when the SEC brings an action against them, including potential criminal actions.       The SEC -       Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Gannon.

09-530 +++$+++        Thank you, General. Mr. Stormer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN STORMER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       So this gets back to Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.     You just said if there is a rational basis, so is that the test?       No matter what type of information?     I suppose it's harder to show a rational basis when you get into certain areas that -- that concern you, but is it a rational basis test?       But in the case of a date of birth for a driver's license, you say it's rational basis?       So -- just to -- I'd like to get back to Justice Breyer's question. So now you not only have to decide which questions -- they can challenge any question they want and say this isn't pertinent, but you also have to categorize which employees are being asked that question. This is a -- SF means "standard form," right?       Well, that -- you know, it's a big government, and they can't tailor every inquiry, every form, to the individual applicant.       But you don't know -- you don't know if it's a low-risk employee until you find out what he -- he or she is like or what the neighbor thinks.     Well, you know, he keeps practicing planting bombs or something.     I mean, then he becomes a high-risk employee.     You don't know until you get the information.     That's the reason you ask for it.       What you're saying -- what you're saying is it may not make much sense to have the people here fill out Standard Form 85, but the Government can't tailor its open -- opening security form to people that -- you know, maybe down the road at a different NASA laboratory, they do work on more sensitive information.     It's a standard form.     The Government has to do things in a standard way.       Under what -- under what law could you -- a private employer not ask for those records?       No, we're talking about under general federal law.       But it's a matter of statutory law.       What do you understand the scope of the preliminary injunction to be?     Does it bar the solicitation of this information throughout the Ninth Circuit or only with respect to JPL?
09-5327 +++$+++                 Thank you, counsel. Mr. Makar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT                Counsel, I'm concerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer mentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane crash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things when it's talking about extraordinary circumstances. Like here, we re talking about how diligent he was in pursuing his lawyer.     There seems to be a disconnect there. I don't know why -- I mean, assuming we re going to have, for argument, equitable tolling, what should we be looking at?       The unusual nature of the situation that comes up, or whether you've got a pesky client?                Well, but it legislated against the background of cases like Irwin that stated the general proposition is, unless Congress says otherwise, there is equitable tolling.                You're not -- you're not worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really extraordinary circumstance where everybody would say, well, that's -- you know, we understand.                 You re worried that if you create an exception, that all sorts of other stuff will come in.              And so why isn't the answer to that concern that you ve got an unusual case here where you do have the client saying, do this, do this, do this, and the lawyer doesn't?                It's very hard to argue against -- against equity, against equitable tolling.    But at the same time, I think you do need a constraining principle that it doesn't do away with the statute of limitations.       So why isn't what we have here good enough?                  Meaning the fact that you have got a client who is constantly telling the lawyer, do this, you know, get it done; doesn't get the judgment.   And, you know, it's not just your run-of-the-mill case where the lawyer happens to miss a deadline.                What -- why isn't it extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline?               I mean, you either miss it or you don't.               It's not going to get -- why doesn't that qualify as extreme attorney misconduct?                I mean, give me an example.                That's worse than missing the deadline.                Well, we don t -- that's not negligence.                So you re -- it has to be criminal behavior?
09-559 +++$+++                   Thank you, Mr. Bopp. General MCKenna. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M. MCKENNA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS                  Would these records --                  Counsel --                  Counsel, if the State had a law that you could disclose voters and for whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment interests?                  What would the First Amendment interests be?                  Yes.                  Do you think having your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have a chilling effect on whether you sign it?                  You don't think revealing that you re a voter has the same chilling effect as revealing how you voted, do you?                   Well, I thought you told me that the First Amendment interests were implicated with respect to the secret ballot, that you couldn't require people to reveal how they voted.                  Counsel, your answer to Justice Breyer was that they can bring an as-applied challenge.     Now, that as-applied challenge would be small comfort unless the names were protected pending the resolution of that challenge, correct?                  So you think a stay should be granted in this case to allow the Petitioners to pursue an as-applied challenge.                   Do you think that the disclosure of the names, pending the resolution of their as-applied challenge, would subject them to incidents of violence and intimidation?                   There s no evidence -- there s no evidence of episodes of violence or intimidation?                  What -- what's the most sensitive similar petition for a referendum?                  No, but what s the --                  What s -- what's the other one that's going to get people -- that's the most controversial public issue?                  No, I'm talking about in Washington, counsel.                  Was the referendum in favor or opposed to assisted suicide?                   What percentage -- what percentage of the people who signed this petition to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it because they think these sort of things should be generally put to a public vote as opposed to because they opposed the law?                   You think as much as 20 percent of the people who signed this petition are actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?                  I thought one of the reasons you wanted to do this was so people would have information that would allow them to participate in the civic process, and there are people who -- might think it makes a difference whether a referendum was requested by -- primarily by members of a particular ethnic group or not.   So isn't -- doesn't -- I thought your brief would say the State has an interest in that type of disclosure.                 How can they --                 How can they find that out with just the name and address, that a large number of people from a company signed it?                 You don't have to put on who you work for, do you?                     I'm sorry.   I'm still on the companies.     How -- how does knowing who the sponsors are tell you how many people from a particular company signed the petition?
09-571 +++$+++        Mr. Cooney. ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. GORDON COONEY, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, Justice Alito's question was, what you would tell the assistant DAs?     What's your answer?       Okay.     That's your instruction on Brady.     Now, you're basing liability on -- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady.     So you say they should have instructed on Brady. What else should they have instructed on?       You're the -- you're the new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct my people.     What -- what do they instruct on?     I know they instruct on Brady under your view.     What else?       Well, we're looking at -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to violate the Constitution.     I think that's a good thing, to tell them they have an obligation as well to protect the innocent. But we're worried about violations of our constitutional requirements.     We know Brady is one. What's the next one?     What's day 2 in the course?       So if it is -- prosecutors can violate a defendant's constitutional rights by making improper statements in their closing arguments. Do you have to instruct new -- I suspect new prosecutors coming out of law school don't know what those rules are.     Do you have to give instruction on what they can say in closing arguments?       Yes.     My understanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in criminal law.     I need training in that.     But my understanding is that comments in a closing argument can give rise to a constitutional violation. So you should -- you should train those people.     You know that.     You know that that can happen, just as you know there can be Brady violations.     So they need training in exactly what they can say and can't say in closing argument.       When you're talking about improper comments in closing argument, it is the prosecuting attorney.       So you don't -- you don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?       Could I ask you what -- most law offices with which I'm familiar, the training is mentoring.     In other words, the young attorneys learn from the older attorneys, often by following them along -- around. Would it have been an adequate training program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors, you don't get to be first chair prosecutors until after a year, and you're going to follow one of the prosecutors around and learn from them?     Is that an adequate training program?       Yes.       Even -- even if the violation that becomes the basis for the claim later on is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year?     We -- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year. They went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn about this type of question.     And --       Does that give rise to a claim of the sort you're bringing here?       But isn't that -- isn't that best practice?     In other words, I thought that was the good thing, when what the prosecutor does is say look at everything we've got.     And as my brother has suggested, what is important may not be there for either deliberate misconduct or by happenstance.       Would this have been -- would this be a no-training case if the rule was you have to be in the office for 3 years as a second chair prosecutor before we let you have a case, and, in fact, you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a capital case?     That's all it says.     Is that sufficient training?       How do you train your new hires?     First day, somebody right out of law school shows up and says, I want to be an assistant district attorney.     How do you train them?
09-5801 +++$+++        Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Counsel, what if - if the Court were to determine that this does violate the Equal Protection Clause, and the court were also to determine that this is not a case that should be the first one in history in which it grants naturalization, what do you think the Court ought to do?       On the ground that it violates equal protection.       What about your friend's point that that retroactively deprives people of citizenship that we would be saying they should have gotten if the Equal Protection Clause had been enforced.       Right.     But here, of course, under my scenario we don't have a situation where Congress has addressed -- addressed the problem. So what do we do?     If somebody under the theory that we say this person should not have been denied citizenship because of the unequal protection in the law, and he comes in and it's the same situation, he's going to be deported for not being an American citizen and he says I'm an American citizen.       Does he get the benefit of that or not?       The reason it doesn't grant that relief is somewhat unusual in this case.     It only doesn't grant him relief because of the third-party standing.     He doesn't care whether he's treated equally or not; he just wants to be -- claim the benefit of citizenship. The person where he would get relief is if it were the father, because the relief that he is entitled to is to be treated equally.     That's it. The relief this person is asking for is not to be deported.     And so the problem of the relief being granted is really complicated by the fact that it's a case of third-party standing.       Counsel, if we determine that the only remedy we can impose is to equalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the mother rather than relieving the father of it, do you have authority for the proposition that we can address that issue hypothetically?     In other words, without making a decision on the equal protection question on the merits?       In other words, look ahead and if you say, look, the only remedy that we are going to be able to give this person is a remedy that isn't going to benefit him regardless of how the merits are decided, therefore we don't reach the merits.
09-587 +++$+++        Mr. Gardner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD GARDNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So -- so the idea is that Johnson drags Klein.     This is your theory, right? Because you are not suggesting he could have lifted Klein and walked him over, are you?       Really?     Did you have an expert testify to that?       Did you get expert testimony about that or an expert report about that?       But you think you can assume that he could lift the weight.     How much did Klein weigh?       And Johnson?       Okay.     And you say that he could have dragged him from the pool to the couch because there were drops along the way.       What other -       Counsel, what other expert evidence should Richter's counsel have pursued before deciding upon his course of action in this case? Put aside the blood-spatter expert.     What other experts did he need to consult?       Okay.     We have got a blood-spatter expert, a ballistics expert.     Go on. I thought, in their habeas proceeding, you said he should have consulted a serologist and a pathologist.     Okay, that's four.     Why wouldn't he have wanted to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol and drugs on people's different perceptions of the events?       I thought the Ninth Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the State's expert in the middle of trial.       Did I understand you -- I just want to step back to the prior answer. You think what counsel did here would have been effective assistance but for exactly what he said in the opening statement?       You mean the case against Gunner you've just described, would it have been enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's decision to focus on credibility rather than expert physical evidence?       Did -- did counsel have to investigate the other aspects?     I mean, we're talking -- we're focusing on the scene where the shooting took place.     Did he have to consider experts with respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns, Richter's apartment, the vehicle that was used?     One thing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire expert because of the vehicle.     He has to look at the possibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect of the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim?       Does -- does -- what else is the lawyer supposed to do?     He thinks no matter what -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut against his client because his client did it.       Counsel, your case -- your case does involve the AEDPA issue.     Perhaps you want to turn -       -- to that now.       It worked.       Thank you, counsel.

09-737 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Mizer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Yes, that -- that is right, and I find it, in the context where that already matters, whether they're appealable as a collateral issue already very difficult and complicated to sort out.     Now, what you want us to do is take that difficulty and continue it on in terms of when you can appeal and when you can't. Some qualified immunity claims are purely legal.     Some are purely factual.     Some are in the middle.     Wouldn't it be easier if we just said:     Here's the rule from now on; you've got to renew them all in a 50(b) motion.     And that makes it a lot easier for the trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when they have to -- when they can consider it and when they can't. I understand your argument that it makes a difference.     I think it's a good argument, because some don't depend on the facts.     But going forward, it just creates an awful lot of difficulty that we don't need to buy into.       I just want to be clear.

09-751 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Phelps. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGIE J. PHELPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       What is your answer -- what is your answer to Justice Alito's question?     Do you think the First Amendment would bar that cause of action or not?       So you think there are situations where a tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is allowed, even for a matter of public debate?       Well, I understood the hypothetical, that the person disagreed with the war in Iraq and the sending of American troops there.       The person selects the grandmother because he thinks that will give maximum publicity to his views.     Now, is -- does the First Amendment bar that cause of action or not?       Well, no -- Justice -- Justice Alito posed, the grandmother was returning from the grave of her grandson.     She didn't enter the public discussion at all.     So I'm anxious to determine whether in those circumstances you think the First Amendment allows that cause of action or not.       Do you think it satisfies the normal tort or law against stalking for someone to come up to an individual and engage in discussion?     I thought a lot more was required.       But Your response -- your response to Justice Alito is dwelling on the facts of this particular case.       I'm interested in knowing what your position is on the broader question. Can you imagine a circumstance where this same type of discussion is directed at an individual and yet would give rise to the tort of emotional distress?       I'm sorry -- can or cannot?       You can.       Okay.     So if you recognize that there can be a tort of emotional distress in circumstances like that, isn't that the factual question of whether it rises to that level of outrageousness, which is part of the tort for the jury?       Does it make --       I'm sorry.       Does it make a difference --       Does it make a difference, which seems to me to be the case here, that Mr. Snyder was selected not because of who he was, but because it was a way to get maximum publicity for your client's particular message?       Well, assuming it is accurate, does that make a difference?       Well, it might affect whether or not the selection inflicts emotional distress for a reason unconnected with the individual who is the subject of emotional distress.       In other words, if the person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives maximum publicity, rather than because of a particular connection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if that makes a difference.       Well, so that -- what -- what if -- did Mr. Snyder, the father, become a public figure simply because his son was killed in Iraq?       Okay.     So if didn't take out --       If he didn't take out the usual obituary notice, then this case should come out the other way?       All right.     Well, let's just say he does nothing.     He does nothing other than bury his son.       He is then not a public figure?       Well, that's because if he does nothing and it's not publicized, you don't get the maximum publicity that your clients are looking for.     My question is, if he simply buries his son, is he a public figure open to this protest or -- or not?       Thank you, Ms. Phelps.
09-804 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Bruce. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BRUCE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       It seems to me that it's a very tough argument to say -- to make a nondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is part of the plan, because the whole point of a summary is not to disclose everything.     If it disclosed everything, it wouldn't be a summary.     And if you can claim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems to me that's in tension with the idea that it's not supposed to be just a repetition of the plan.       Could I just stop - the securities cases, does that involve stock traded in a market, in which case the inference of harm would be much more obvious and follow more logically than in the trust context?       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
09-834 +++$+++        Justice Scalia's hypothetical, unless I am misremembering, I think, is very common.     For example, the EEOC, people often file complaints and then the EEOC considers whether it's going to institute a proceeding or not.       What if you are an employee of the Treasury Department and there is an oral complaint to your superior?     Is that filing a complaint with the Government?       Okay.     Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
09-837 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Olson. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       What if -- what if the school said:     You have to get all this clinical experience, but we're going to pay you for the first two hours of the day that you're doing that.     Does that change the analysis at all? You seem to be focusing on how many hours they're working.     But what if the school says:     Well, look, we recognize some of this is going to school and some of this is working; so, just like the IRS, we're going to have an arbitrary rule and we're going to say you're being paid for the first two hours.       It looks more -- if you accept their classification, it looks more like the work is incidental to their status as a student.     The other way around.       Yes.       It would if they - and presumably, you would say it does if they don't pay them anything.
09-846 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Yang. Ms. Spinelli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Can you get the accounting in conjunction with the claim of damages? Maybe the Court of Federal Claims, you can't go there and say, look, I want an accounting, but you can say I have been wronged over the century and I would like to find out to what extent, and before you can figure that out you actually have to have an accounting.     Can't the Court of Federal Claims get an accounting in that context?       Okay.     It's a remedy, but is it terribly different from what the accounting the Court of Federal Claims would order to figure out how much -
09-868 +++$+++        Ms. Mizner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Why don't you just call your motion a motion to correct an illegal sentence?     Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I gather.       You're not one of the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before. (Laughter.)       I'm sure of that. But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoever files these motions had simply said that, there would be no problem, right?       Well, it's because you want something other than legal review, right?     You want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court. You've got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality of the sentence, but this is something different, right? This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but you say but it should still be reduced for a lot of reasons.       You can raise all of those -- all of those claims under the normal State collateral postconviction, State habeas, all those other things, right?       So I guess I'm having trouble.     You can -- the various grounds on which the sentence should have been lower than it was, including the fact that setting the sentence at that level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on direct review, right?       Can you challenge it on -- in State habeas?       That's the only vehicle you have -       It's the only vehicle you have for challenging the sentence.       I -- I may have asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want to make sure of the answer.     Your -- you have a client who is convicted of a particular offense that results in a sentence of, what, zero to 5 years, okay?     And the judge, in imposing the sentence, engages in racial discrimination.     It turns out that he sentences African-Americans to 5 years and Caucasian defendants to years.     That, you're telling me, is a claim that you cannot raise on direct review or on -- in State habeas?       Well, you say it "would be raised."     Are you saying it can only be raised under Rule 35?       That's what I would have thought.     So Rule 35 is not the only vehicle for challenging a sentence?       Okay.       Well, I guess the question -- and I'm sorry if I cut you off -- is not that this is a question of abuse, that it may be a good thing.     The idea is you've got a motion for reduction of sentence because of mercy, and the judge might say: Well, I'm inclined to exercise mercy if you come out of the rehab program in a good way, if it turns out after the first several months that you're a model prisoner. In other words, it's not a question of abuse, it's a good thing; and if we start saying that the time for Federal habeas is tolled, judges might be inclined not to exercise such charity based on the prisoner's conduct after conviction.       120 days, right?       For filing?       Right.
09-893 +++$+++        Mr. Gupta. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       If I could just go to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle that applies to every other contract.       No, but the substantive State liability rule on the issue you are addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex ante, and with respect to arbitration you are considering it at the time the dispute arose.     Isn't that a discrimination against arbitration agreements?       Well, sure.     That's true in all of these cases.       It's a question of what the State law provides; then you consider whether it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.       Well, what other area of contract law does the court consider unconscionability not with respect to the parties before the court, but with respect to third parties?       But isn't that - doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather than third parties?       Well, it's a general rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public policy could be unenforceable.     It seems to me that's quite different than saying we're worried about third parties that are in the same position as these particular parties.     In other words, it's not simply adverse public consequences, but it's a different mode of analysis than I'm familiar with under basic contract law.       Where do you get -       Where do you get "obvious subterfuge" in the Federal Arbitration Act?       But that's in the independent and adequate State ground context, which strikes me as quite different.     We have a statute here that says the arbitration agreements have to be treated like any other contract, any contract.     I don't see how that's the same as obvious subterfuge.       Thank you, counsel.
09-9000 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Owen. Mr. Coleman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, he says exculpatory evidence that could demonstrate that he's not guilty.     There's a lot of exculpatory evidence that might imply, necessarily imply guilt, but there's a lot of exculpatory evidence that simply is helpful and doesn't mean it will demonstrate.     He says it could.       So -- so the -       -- Justice Ginsburg's question I think is an important one.     Are you going to argue that you fit within -- this case fits within "necessarily implies," or is there another formulation that you think we should have?       No, but just -       Briefly.       Thank you, counsel.
09-907 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Maynard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So if they have pre-purchased their food expenses, so long as they have $1 of food expense they get the entire expense even though they're not incurring it?       And there are things like, you can pay up, you know, have the grocery deliver your food every month and you can pay in advance, and if you're paid up, you still get the full food expense that is allowed?       But if you paid $1 for food, you'd get the full amount for 60 months?       So your argument leads to a result that's just as absurd as your colleague's result on the other side.       I mean, that was a big part of your argument.     You said his position leads to an absurd result, and yours is just as absurd.       Your -- your position penalizes debtors who pay their expenses in advance, who don't incur additional debt to pay for things like their car.     I would have thought the Bankruptcy Code would think that's a good thing, that they're not incurring debt that they can't afford to pay off, but instead, to the extent they can, they're paying expenses in advance.     Why should somebody who does that be in a worse position than somebody -- than somebody who takes out a loan they can't afford to pay back?       Well, he hasn't incurred -- he hasn't incurred expenses.     It's the whole point, I guess, that he's paid for something.       Even though he can do it -- even though he can do it for everything else - he can do it for food, he can do it for housekeeping expenses, he can do it for personal care expenses, he can even do it -- the other, the final category is miscellaneous, so he can do it for anything.       Why don't you finish answering the question?       Do you think that -       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT       And if he paid -       If he paid a dollar, he would be able to shield $27,999, and you're comfortable with that result?       And I understood your brief to say it was the amount -- you get the whole amount, not simply as a cap.       If the point of the $1, counsel, is to lead to the extreme hypothetical that would flesh out your position, what if it were $10,000 and the amount would give him $30,000?     The trustees have probably seen loans like that.       Ms. Saharsky, I should -- I should probably know this, but if you do have amounts that are excluded from the disposable income because of car ownership, in other words, you actually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses, do they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are they available for everybody?     All the creditors?       But can he decide - let's say he has more food expense than is allowed.     Can he decide of the amount that would otherwise go for the car payment that he's going to pay some of that for the food expenses?
09-958 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Why isn't -- why doesn't your position constitute a complete end run around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence? We've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out whether there's an implied right of action under a particular statute if there has always been one under the Supremacy Clause?       How can they have much broader -- broader -- first of all, all of those cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly a lot of them did include -- included claims for injunctive relief.     And I would have thought the court's authority under your equitable action under the Constitution would be at least as broad as it would be under the statute.       But your position --       Your position --       Your position is that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything where the State law is pre-empted by the Federal law. That doesn't sound very narrow to me.       What if the --       What if the law that Congress is -- Congress passes sets forth certain Federal standards -- it's a cooperative Federal-State law like this one -- and it says:     And there's no private right of action for any individual to enforce this.     That's limited to the Federal Government.       So, Congress can say --       Congress can say in the same statute that confers the allegedly pre-emptive Federal standards that we do not want individuals bringing actions in court to enforce this.     We want to leave that up to HHS.     And you're saying, even though Congress said that, individuals can nonetheless bring a suit under the Supremacy Clause, the theory of which is we are making sure that Federal law controls.       The same Federal law that says you can't bring a cause of action.       Why is there no --       Why is there no suit if the agency doesn't approve?       You're saying Congress can't say there's no implied right of action.       But the agency can?       Do you have the same answer or a different one?       But you still have a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause.       I thought you were saying you didn't --       -- if the agency --       Why does the --       Why does the agency get to determine Federal law when Congress doesn't?     You told me earlier if Congress --       -- Congress says in a statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't control.       The answer is yes, they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under the statute.     I understand that you're not challenging the proposition that this statute, when Congress was specifically focused on the question of how to enforce this provision, they did not provide a right of action. And under our implied right of action jurisprudence, that means there isn't one. So, why when they're confronted with the precise question did they say no, we don't want these people to sue, but you say, well, they knew under the Constitution they were going to be able to anyway?
09-987 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bender. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       How does this take -- how does this take the beneficiaries' religion into account when the program works perfectly -- in exactly the same way if it's a nonreligious school?     They don't care whether it's a religious school or not.       No, no.     I'm trying -- I don't think that's my-- I hope that wasn't my question.     It's how is it discriminating on the basis of religion if the STOs and the government money -- it doesn't care whether it goes to a religious school or not; it's treated the same?       The State money going to the STO -- the State doesn't care whether it goes to a religious STO or a secular STO.       I thought we've held that when you have the decision is made by a private entity whether to use the money to go to a religious school or a nonreligious school, that that doesn't violate the Constitution because the decision is not made by the State; it's made by the private recipient.       I'm sorry, could we get -- just to get back to Bowen for a moment.       The entities that were distributing the funds could be private or religious?       The entities are not -- in Bowen, were not identified.     The recipients of the State funds were -- as here, they weren't identified as religious or not?       Excuse me.     Just to follow on Justice Scalia's question, because I want to make sure you have the answer:     If this system were set up exactly as it is now, but Arizona said contributions to STOs are deductible, you'd have no problem?       Right.       So the only difference is that Arizona set up this system where you get a tax credit instead of a tax deduction?       I'm sorry -       -- I don't understand the answer to Justice Breyer's question.     His question was, you give it to a hospital equivalent of the STO, and then that gives it to hospitals on a religiously discriminatory basis.     Why aren't the hospitals the beneficiaries of that program, just as you say the parents are here.       Well, they're the ones who get the CAT scan -
09-993 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Lefkowitz. Mr. Bograd. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS M. BOGRAD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       But what happens -       How long does it take -- how long typically does it take the FDA to respond to a request from a generic manufacturer that it -- it ask the branded manufacturer to change the label?       Are those the ones that are submitted by generic manufacturers?       -- whether about -       I was just going to ask, does the FDA give you an up or a down, or does it just not take action sometimes if you submit one of these requests?       Counsel -       You can finish your sentence.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       So if your theory of the case is accepted, this is what will happen:     Every time a generic manufacturer gets an adverse incident report, it will send that on to the FDA, and there will be a boilerplate sentence at the end of it saying, We think you should consider revising the labels because of this, and then, under your theory, that manufacturer is completely protected from State suits?       Sure.       Well, they're not going to take a chance.     They're going to say, if you're the FDA, you look at it.     We're just telling you what we know, and we think you ought to consider revising the label.       Okay.     We think you should revise the label; if you agree, this is what it should look like.       Does it lead to preemption?       Does it lead to preemption?       Right.     Wouldn't you -- if you were the generic company's lawyer, you would advise them to do that in every case, right?       No, I know that's what this case is, but if -- a reasonable generic manufacturer would be worried about every case, and it would just add this boilerplate language at the end of every letter, and as I understand your theory, they would be protected.       And in the brief - and in the brief that you filed you said one of the concerns is that people are going to flood the FDA with all these warnings and -- and whatever, and that would interfere with the FDA's ability.     Now you're telling me -- you -- you said when you started out that you think it's unlikely or you don't think it's likely.     In your brief it said SG language you said we're not prepared to predict that a ruling would do this. So, why is that a difference between those two cases?       Well, but it's not -- the regulation doesn't say propose a labeling change.     It says labeling shall be revised, and the one thing we know is that the generic manufacturer can't revise the labeling from the branded one.
09-996 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bigelow. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. BIGELOW ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, but everybody -- everybody in this room can tell him that he is obligated to file the petition as promptly as the circumstances allow.     He has complete notice of that. And if he wants to go and do the research and say, well, here's one where they let it in after 5 months, but here's one where they didn't leave it in after 9 months, and he sits here and decides so I'm going to wait 9 months and put my money on that court -- that -- that is not a scenario that's likely to happen, right?       You're not challenging that as the State rule, are you?       Right.       And they didn't look at possible justifications at all, correct?       No, no.     I'm not asking about Mr. Martin's.       This -- the analysis that the amicus undertook simply looked at the chronological time.     They did not consider the fact that, for example, somebody with 3 years might have had an explanation; somebody with 1 year might have not had any.     And they may view those cases as different cases.       Well, how did they look -- did they look for explanations for delay when you had the one-sentence denial?       Well, how much range are you willing to give the State?     Do they have 3 months' range?     I mean, if you come in and say, well, here they were filed in 9 months and they were allowed, and here they were filed in 6 months and they weren't allowed. Is that a problem under our consistency requirement?       No, it says -       It says "as promptly as the circumstances allow."     And then they go back and say there is a 3-range, a 3-month range.       You do the same sort of research you've done here, and you find out that - that there's a 3-month range.     Sometimes -- I mean, there are cases and you can show a lot where they are allowed at 9 months, and then you find cases that are not allowed under 6 months.       Now, I understand that you'd have a much stronger case if you were dealing with a judge-made rule about timeliness, if the courts, on their own authority, said, look, we're not going to look at things that are filed 4 years late because that prejudices the State, it prejudices us, et cetera. But here you have something different.     You have a rule, right?     An established rule:     promptly as the circumstances allow.       Judge-made, but it's been around for a long time.     This isn't a new rule that's just coming in.       Well, let me get back.     I tried to -- when you made that point earlier, I wanted to follow up on it.     Your claim is not that you don't know or defendants in California don't know that the rule is "as promptly as the circumstances allow," do you?       No.     I thought you had fair notice of that rule.       Okay.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Suppose -       I suppose -- we have held, haven't we, that States can have different concepts of mootness than the Federal one?       Counsel, do you know why we're not hearing from the State of South Carolina?       No, no.     I understand that they were involved below.     They decided not to become a party before the State supreme court; is that right?       Why aren't they defending their procedures?       It may be an unfair question, since you don't represent the State.       I think it would be a great financial interest if they have to provide counsel in these thousands and thousands of cases.       But that can't possibly be true, because we have cases applying the rule that this is capable of repetition, yet evading review.     If the rule were you have to get a stay, we wouldn't have any of those cases.

MCGILL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Your case --       No, you can finish your answer.       Your case highlights -- I think is a very good example of why the lawyer ought to have qualified immunity.     I mean, this was a case where it looks like there's a lot of threatening and bullying going on.     I mean, the -- the lawyer says -- you know, we're going to figure out a way to name you, Mr. Filarsky.     You're issuing an illegal order.     If you want to take that chance go right ahead. You might want to think -- take a minute to think about it. I mean, it seems exactly the kind of situation for which qualified immunity was -- was developed.     We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what he thinks is the right thing in this situation.     We don't want him to be worried about the fact that he might be sued.     And you have a lawyer here saying, well, if you do that, I'm going to sue you.     So, Filarsky naturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to think, wow, do I really want to run that risk? Isn't that exactly why we have qualified immunity?       -- saying I'm going to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer.     And you're sitting in that situation.     Isn't that going to enter into your mind?     You say, well, sue all you want; I don't care; this is the right answer.       Right.       Well, how do you know?       Well, he had -- he had the chief issue the order, right?       And then the chief later on says, well, he told me to issue the order.     I mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as they would if you had qualified immunity.       Well, particularly --       Well, even as -- the reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got this stuff at my house.     That's how his -- his defense is.     I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there. So, you think it's still clearly established that it violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay, well, show it to us if you want to use that as your defense?       What if Filarsky was there, you know, hired to help the fire department with these -- and he did absolutely nothing?     He just sits there and watches.     The battalion chief says, I want to do this; I'm going to go get the stuff; you bring it all out.     And he just -- he just sits there, doesn't see any reason to offer any legal advice or opinion.     Could you still sue him under 1983?       Really?     He has an obligation as a lawyer to speak up if he thinks something illegal is going on.     That's his job.     And he doesn't -- he just sits there quietly?       What if he -- this for profits -- I -- the significance of that eludes me. Sometimes people act out of, you know, public service, and particularly in these sorts of situations, the town needs a lawyer, and he's helping out.     What -- if he were purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer?       And, well -- and what if he gives the city a discount?     He's working for half -- half his fee because it's the city.     He wants to help out, but he can't do it totally for free.     So, it's 50 percent his normal rate.       Are all of these -- are all of these objections applicable as well to the determination of whether there is state action from the attorney's conduct?       Yes.       Yes.       But your -- your objection is not that he was investigating workplace conduct; your objection is that he was ordering people to tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his house.       Yes, but telling people basically either executing a search or in effect executing a search, that is a uniquely governmental function.

If it's okay to get money for a referral, what type of kickback is not okay?       What -- you were you about to tell us what we said in Long Island Home.       Which -- putting aside the notice-and-comment point, which I think is at least ambiguous, which of our cases stands for the proposition that whether or not we give Chevron deference depends on the thoroughness with which the agency addressed an issue, rather than simply an announcement of its interpretation?       Thank you, counsel.
10-1062 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       I don't follow -- I didn't follow that.     What is your response to the assertion that you're subject to double penalties?       One, for violating the Act; two, for violating the compliance order.       Well, but you don't doubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the authority to do that?       Justice Alito.       Well, and that's not their argument today, either.       Counsel, you referred a couple of times to the EPA's view of the statute.     I take it that's your view as well?       What would you -- what would you do, Mr. Stewart, if you received this compliance order?     You don't think your -- your property has wetlands on it, and you get this compliance order from the EPA.     What would you do?       If they weren't in the record, I don't want to hear about them.     You appreciate that rule, that we don't consider things that aren't in the record. You get a compliance order.     You don't think your property has wetlands.     What do you do?       You wouldn't do that, right?     You know you'll never get an after-the-fact permit if the EPA has sent you a compliance order saying you've got wetlands.       That's what you would do?     You would say:     I don't think there are wetlands on my property, but EPA does.     So, I'm going to take out all the fill; I'm going to plant herbaceous trees or whatever it is; and I'll worry about whether to -- that way, I'll just do what the government tells me I should do.       In other words, what the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says, because you didn't apply for a permit, you're in trouble because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we were going to take away your constitutional rights or not; so, we can do it.       If you --       Well, that's -- that's right.     In other words, you hope you have -- you've looked at it.     You hope you have a sufficient basis.     And because of the administrative compliance order, you're really never going to be put to the test because most landowners aren't going to say, I'm going to risk the $37,000 a day.     All EPA has to do is make whatever finding it wants and realize that in 99 percent of the cases, it's never going to be put to the test.
10-1104 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Preis. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. PREIS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, before you do, on page 5 of your brief you say, in the private prison setting, quote, "'a Bivens claim against the offending individual offending officer,'" end quote, is an appropriate remedy.     And the quote is from Malesko.       What we said in Malesko, where you quote, is that if a Federal prisoner in a BOP facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer.     Now, your friend describes that as a distortion of what we said in Malesko, and I just wanted to give you a chance to reply to what I think is a fairly serious assertion.       Well, just to be clear, you quote that language -- you say "in the private prison setting"; and the language specifically says in a BOP facility.       You would expect the same rule.     That's your argument --       -- to apply in the private prison setting.     What you say is that there we explained that, in the private prison setting, a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer was the appropriate remedy.       What about medical malpractice caps?     Is that an issue?     In other words, State law -- and I don't know how many there are; I know it's been proposed -- I think it's true in some cases will cap your recovery for medical malpractice at a particular level.       I was -- that was a helpful question, in the sense that -- (Laughter.)       The Bivens action -- presumably the cap would not apply.     But it applies under State law.       Do you disagree that the -- I know you have your argument on compensation --       -- but with respect to deterrence, is there any significant difference between the two causes of action?     In other words, if you think the most significant aspect of Bivens is to deter constitutional violations, doesn't that work equally as well or perhaps more effectively under the State law than under Bivens?       So, your answer -- your answer is the same as under compensation, that the State law might be different or not?       Who -- who actually ends up paying in these Bivens actions?     Is it the -- I mean --       -- the Federal Government or an individual or --       I'm just looking in terms of the practical deterrence.     The problem I've had with it in general, I don't know how much practical deterrence there is as if you sue the individual and the -- the individual doesn't actually pay; the government does.     It seems to me perhaps more likely in the private context that the individual may get stuck with some amount of the liability if the employer just says, look, you were off doing something you weren't supposed to do; we're not going to pay for it.
10-1121 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Collins. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH COLLINS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Why do -- why did you give up once the case was granted here?     You didn't consider that until the case came before this Court.       But this is not -- this is not an incidental matter.     I mean, the whole point of your friend's argument with the Hudson notice is they want people to understand what's happening with the -- their union money.     And they say this notice didn't let people know that.     And if the case is not moot and if they prevail, they will have a right to be heard on what the notice should say.     And that will make a difference in how many people opt out or how many people don't. And I guess I'm following up on Justice Kagan's question.     That's a very important part of this case, what the notice is going to say, and if we accept your view that it's moot, that issue goes by the wayside.       I'm sorry.     I don't see how that -- I don't see how that works. The notice is only required by the district court if the case is not moot.     If the case is moot by the notice you sent out, the district court doesn't have a case on the basis of which to order a different notice.       But -- I want you to move to the merits.     It may be a good time to do that.       I thought your point, though -- this was a very special ballot initiative.     That's what the literature suggests, that this was not sort of the normal run in the course -- every 2 years, every election cycle, we spend something. That's why it's a special assessment.       No, it's not short-term; it's just until November 7th or whatever.       One reason -- I mean, we're dealing with the situation where the union is compelling nonunion members to give them money for political activities.     We allow, as I understand Hudson, as I read it, because you can't figure out what that is, you wait until the end of the year.     In other words, it's a compromise for administrative convenience. Normally, you wouldn't allow it at all, as -- at least under the law as I read it, you would not allow people to take money -- you would not allow the union to take money from people who don't want to spend it on political activities so the union can spend it on political activities.     But we allow that in the course of the year because it's impossible as you go on to sort these things out.     I thought the argument on the other side was when you have a special assessment, an additional charge, there you don't have the administrative problem.     You can tell it's .25 percent. So, you can't take that until you tell them, do you want to object or are you happy -- are you fine with having this spent on political purposes?       But on the -- I'm reading from the district court opinion.     It said that this assessment would be used -- and they're quoting from union material -- "for a broad range of political expenses, including television, radio advertising, direct mail, voter registration, voter education, and get out the vote activities in our work sites and in communities across California."     And it further said, quote, "The fund will not be used for regular costs of the union such as office rent, staff salaries or routine equipment replacement."
10-114 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stancil. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       If the liability under the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability under the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the Federal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I were the client, I would say your degree of success was zero.     I still have to pay $100,000. The fact that you won on one claim but then lost the whole issue -- the whole value on another, I wouldn't call that a degree of success.       And I assume you agree that discretion can end up going either way?     You could submit time sheets that show 35 percent of our time was spent on the Federal case, and the district judge can say, you know, time sheets are subject to - manipulation is too strong a word, but I'm just not going to give you 35 percent; I'm going to give you 10 percent.     That's a reasonable exercise of discretion. The judge doesn't have to say a whole lot about it and it's certainly going to be upheld on -- on appeal, right?       So you disagree with the statement in the -- in the Court of Appeals opinion about, only for fees that can be distinctly traced?       I understood your adversary to agree with that position.     You'll need to switch sides, right?       But your argument has focused, in reference to the complaint and all that, on the legal theories.     Your friend has focused on the underlying factual basis, and all the litigation -- all the background work on the underlying factual basis, I don't know why that can be fairly attributed only to the claim.

So, I can get a patent for that?      No, no, no.    No. 15     Well, let me put it --      That's patent -- 19     that's patent- eligible.      I was just going to 24     say, what is the great advantage you see of putting this 25     critical question off until the 102, 103 analysis, rather than cutting it off at the beginning, 101, which 2     I understand your friend to say is very important      What about -- what 12     about litigation?    Is it -- it is easier to throw something out at the threshold level, isn't it, than to 14     move further down the line?      Finish your 12     sentence.      Thank you, General. 19                 Mr. Bress. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS 21                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      Well, it seems to me 19     that's your -- the problem with your whole approach is 20     that every time you're pressed on 101, your answer is to 21     fall back to 102 or 103 or the utility part of 101.    And 22     I'm just wondering why it's beneficial to essentially 23     eliminate 101 and say, oh, we'll catch everything later 24     on.
10-1195 +++$+++       Now, which -- which are we supposed to decide?    I can see the Federal 2     question jurisdiction issue being straightforward. Federal law creates this cause of action; therefore, you 4     can say that it is -- under 1331, there's jurisdiction, 5     but then you can't do anything once you're in Federal 6     court because the private right of action is limited to 7     State court.      Counsel, I -- we've 12     been talking about where this provision fits, basically, 13     into our general jurisprudence in this area.    But I've 14     never seen a statute remotely like this before.    Is 15     there any one, where you have a Federal -- where you 16     have Congress creating a cause of action that can be 17     brought in State courts unless the State court says it 18     can't, saying nothing at all about whether there's a 19     Federal cause of action?    This is the strangest statute 20     I've ever seen.
10-1211 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Miller. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Counsel, I have to -- I just don't understand this statute.     This is somebody we would not allow into the country.     And yet, the only thing we say is you can't leave.     I just don't understand how that -- how that works.       No.     Right.       Well, I know, and I understand that there is a limitation on actually deporting the person.     But here I would think the one thing you want the person to do is leave.     Maybe for a particular event, but maybe he'll decide to stay in Greece if once he's there for the -- but it seems very odd to say we're going to show you how much we don't want you here; we're not going to let you leave.       What is the -- what is the policy underlying the rule that doesn't allow somebody who has a lawful status here to go to his grandmother's funeral --       -- and come back? It's going to take 4 days.     He goes; he comes back. What policy supports prohibiting that travel?       Okay.     They're two different things, but I don't know that you've articulated what the policy is to prevent -- prohibit somebody from doing that.       Could you go over again for me your distinction of St. Cyr?       You don't argue that -- that the significance of what the individual is giving up makes a difference?       Is there -- is there a difference in terms of what they face if they don't plead guilty?     I've always had difficulty with St. Cyr and the notion that, say, someone pleads -- is facing, you know, 10 years, and they plead -- plead guilty to 2 years, that the -- the reason they did that is to, you know, avoid one of these immigration provisions.     It seems to me it is to avoid 8 years.       And I just wonder if the relative significance of what is at issue under the immigration law is something that we can take into account, or if St. Cyr prohibits that?       Thank you, Mr. Miller.
10-1219 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Panner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON M. PANNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       The problem I have with your submission:     You say there are basically two routes to get review of a denial by the Patent Office. The first is, under 141, you appeal to the Federal Circuit, right, and in that situation, you're limited to the record before the agency --       -- on which you lost.     And there's deference to the agency, which ruled against you. Under 145, you can add new evidence, you could address questions that the PTO raised, saying you don't -- you haven't dealt with this valve in the back, and you could say, well, here's new evidence dealing with that.     There's no deference to the agency, and to some extent you can pick which judge you want to hear, to the extent you can -- can do that. Why would anybody proceed under section 141 instead of 145?       So, that in -- in every case where it's anything other than a purely legal issue, you would go under 145?       Well, I know. That's why I'm -- I'm really confused, because I take it that people don't often use 145, right?     They almost always appeal to the Federal Circuit.       Well, Ms. -- Ms. Anders told us that there's a procedure before the PTO that lets you deal with these -- that sort of something came up that you didn't think about, and you can address that.       Because -- I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       I guess, as a practical matter, these things all end up before the Federal Circuit anyway, right?       And I suppose that -- if you had the same case and one is coming up under the 141 and the other under 145, I suppose it's theoretically possible they could reach different results because of different standards of review.       No, no.     I know. I'm not saying -- the point is that although they all come before the Federal Circuit, they may come to them in a very different posture that would cause the Federal Circuit to rule differently if you had the same case under one and under the other.       Right.
10-1259 +++$+++        Thank you.     Your -- our questions have eaten into your rebuttal time.     So, we'll give you the full time. Mr. Leckar. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. LECKAR ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       I didn't -- I didn't hear an answer to Justice Alito's question.     What is your position on the placement of the GPS device on the State-owned license plate?       It's a --       My understanding is correct that it's the State's license plate they require you to have.     So, your trespass theory, it would seem, falls apart with respect to that particular scenario.       No.     It's the size of a credit card.     You slip it behind the license plate.       I thought it made a difference under your theory, which focused on the question of trespass, because it was attached to an effect owned by somebody else.     This is an effect not owned by the individual.       So, the trespass theory anyway doesn't seem ridiculous to me.       How do you know that?       Well, that gets back to Justice Scalia's question, which is you've got to determine that there has been a search first before you impose the warrant requirement.     And it seems to me that your -- the warrant requirement applies only with respect to searches, right?       Okay.     And seizures. So, while it might seem like a good idea to impose the requirement on this particular technological device, you still have to establish that it's a search.       Now, we pushed your -- we pushed your friend to the limits of his theory. Your theory, I take it, would apply if you're going to do it for 3 minutes, right?     Where's the car?     You push a button; it's 3 minutes.     You say that's still a Fourth Amendment violation?       Okay.     Well, then don't talk to me about how long they're going to be doing it or all the information.     We have to test the validity of your theory on the proposition that it violates the Fourth Amendment to do this for 3 minutes.       You have said that several times.     How do we tell?     I mean, I don't know what society expects.     I suppose if you ask people do you think it's a violation of privacy for the police to do this for no reason for a month, maybe they'd come out one way.     If you asked the people do you think the police have to have probable cause before they monitor for 5 minutes the movements of somebody they think is going to set off a huge bomb, maybe you get a different answer.

WAXMAN      So, you are 5     saying --      So, why do you say 15     six times in your brief that the judge was retiring the 16     next day or retired the next day?      There was another 23     judge.      There is another judge.    She's available.    I have to say it strikes me, 2     frankly, as argument by innuendo that I think is very 3     unjustified.      I'm still trying to 16     get to the point -- I'm sorry.    I'm still trying to get 17     to the point of the relevance of the fact that he was 18     retiring.      How does it go -- 22     how does it go to the remedy?      Counsel, I --      No.    I'm trying to 4     help you.    I understood you to say you had an answer to 5     Justice Breyer's question.      Why don't you finish 11     your answer to Justice Sotomayor and then go back to 12     Justice Breyer?      Counsel, if -- the 8     interests of justice, does that include the available 9     resources of the Federal Public Defender?    I mean, those 10     offices are notoriously understaffed.    And here you have 11     a situation where one lawyer has been representing an 12     individual for an awful long time, and the defendant 13     says, I want a new lawyer.    It's obviously going to take 14     that -- a new lawyer away from their work and put them 15     in a position of having to get up to speed in a new 16     case.      Well, that gets to 2     my --      -- restrictions you 16     just talked about.      And one of the 2     things --      And one of the 8     things I think the district court would do in that situation with the same counsel is say, look, this was a 10     tactical strategic decision of the lawyer; you don't get 11     to reopen something because of that.    Now, does that 12     same consideration apply with respect to the substituted 13     counsel, or does the substituted counsel allow the 14     defendant to get a leg up on the process and make new 15     arguments that the old counsel couldn't make?

10-1293 +++$+++        Thank you, General. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS FOX TELEVISION STATIONS, INC., ET AL.       Well, that's because broadcasts didn't commonly have this sort of -- these sorts of words or these sorts of images.       Well, no, we know.       I mean, we can -- it was not the case from 1927 till whenever you -- what, 1970-something -- that nudity commonly appeared on broadcast television or the various words we're dealing with here commonly appeared.     So, it seems a bit much to say, well, they didn't bring any cases for that period. There were no cases to be brought.       But that -- but that -- that cuts both ways.     People who want to watch broadcasts where these words or expose their children to broadcasts where these words are used, where there is nudity, there are 800 channels where they can go for that.     All we're asking for, what the Government is asking for, is a few channels where you can say I'm not going to -- they're not going to hear the "S" word, the "F" word.     They're not going to see nudity.     So, the proliferation of other media, it seems to me, cuts against you.       Well, that's your argument there, is that it's not a legitimate objective to have a safe harbor.       Well, but that depends what your audience --       It depends what audience you're -- you're trying to get and the demographic.     If you're trying to get an audience that is older, maybe you will decide this is what is going to attract them.     They don't want sanitized language.     They want to hear the -- the -- all those other words.     If your target is a much younger audience, maybe that will happen.     But the idea that you're -- the problem is going to go away because you're going to be good as you can be, that seems an odd way to analyze First Amendment problems.      Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS ABC, INC., ET AL.       People understand -- what you're -- have demonstrated, I think, is that the context matters.     People understand that, including children.     When they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's different than having an adult stand in normal conversation and use the words.     And it seems to me that your position is saying that the government cannot regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world. The government's effort is to try to understand the context.     That's why you get a different rule in "Saving Private Ryan" than you get with Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.     And what your argument seems to be is they can't take context into account.       That's what you found -- that's what you've got over --       That's what you've got over 85 years.

10-1399 +++$+++        Mr. Palmore. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT       So, if you're --       So, if you're walking down the street, you're on a business enterprise, they haven't shoveled the snow, you slip and fall and you're hurt, you go home and say:     Good news, I've been awarded damages.       -- of the gray brief.       But you're doing that -- you're doing that without an award.       So, how can you say what the employer pays should be considered an award?       It's without an award.       But those aren't going to be the typical cases, I think.     You said there may be cases, and I suppose there may be.     I assume what happens -- employers just don't write checks.     They say this is how we calculate what we owe you.     And it is based on the maximum of this year, not any future ones, and if the employee says no, no, no; I have a right to get the -- then the employer will say, well, okay, I either agree with that or not, but you don't get a check.       I -- I understand the amounts at issue here.     What is a usual amount that's at stake in this sort of case?     We're talking about the concerns -- I guess on both -- about gamesmanship, but how much difference are we talking about?       I don't know; maybe you don't have statistics, on an average.       The consequence -- I mean, there's the time value of money, too.     The consequence of the employee saying I'm going to wait 5 years because I think the maximum is going to be a lot higher is that he doesn't get anything in the meantime, right?       It's reasonable for an employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll wait.       Thank you, Mr. Palmore. We'll let Mr. Keisler speak for a bit. Mr. Keisler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT       But it's not the way it's used in 914.       But how much of a practical problem is this?     I understand the -- the amounts are here, but it's 5 years, and apparently the employee was happy to wait 5 years to get an award. Normally, if you're an employee and you're disabled, and the employer says, well, here's what we're going to give you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we have, you're not going to say:     I'm going to wait; these wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to wait a year; maybe I'll wait 4 years because I think there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going to cash in on that; I'm going to be without money for the next 4 years and I'm disabled, but -- I mean, that doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation.       Well, no, I mean -- I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and they write at the end of the check, you know:     This is in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the whatever.       Does the maximum always go up?       Theoretically, it can go down.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gillelan, if I got that right, you have 2 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II, ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
10-1472 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Fried. Mr. Himmelfarb. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       One -- one of the things that concerns me is the impact of -- of cost allowance on the normal litigation incentives.     An interpreter in court is one thing.     When you suddenly get a situation where the costs could be quite large, particularly in a -- in a disparate way, not necessarily shared by both sides -- somebody goes into court; they know they're going to have to -- if they lose, they'll have to pay an interpreter this.     And the other side comes in and says, well, we think we need to submit this 10,000 pages of -- of documents, which will have to be translated, and by the way, if you lose, you're going to pay for that. In other words, it is a much more variable element of costs than the interpreter.       So, what -- so, what goes into the exercise of that discretion?       Well, there are two -- there may be two permissible, but you don't dispute the fact that it is more natural and common to speak of someone interpreting oral communication and someone translating written, correct?       Well, just to phrase your answer a different way, you're -- you don't know of any situation in the U.S. Code where "translators" -- or "interpreter" means "translator"?       And you checked every one; so, there is none, right? (Laughter.)       It's an odd result because nobody's going to do it, because at that point you don't know who is going to get saddled with the costs.     So, it wouldn't be likely that you would do something that would increase the costs, would it?       Where are you reading from?

10-1542 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kinnaird. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 10-1542       I don't know whether -- I'm having trouble applying the concepts of unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation.     As far as I can tell, this is something that the statute just doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you characterize that correctly as ambiguous.     It's just kind of off the table.       But it doesn't have to grapple with everything that's not there.     I mean, there are a lot of things that the statutes don't address.       It seems to me that they don't have to grapple with everything that's there. You just have to say this doesn't address it.     So, whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you, loses.       You're saying think this law should allow -- should provide for this, should be extended for this.     And it's one thing to say, well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children in one category but not in another category; so, the issue's there; we don't know what they meant.     It's another thing if it's something that's totally not on the table.     I mean, if -- if you claimed that the law required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't say the statute was ambiguous about that.     You'd say it doesn't have anything to do with it.       Isn't it -- why can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background principle apply that you're not entitled to admission unless you make an affirmative case for it? You say, well, the -- the government hasn't advanced any policy reason on the other side.     Why isn't that the basic policy of the government?       Thank you, Mr. Kinnaird. Mr. Rothfeld. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 10-1543       We usually like to start with the statutory language.     Where is this issue addressed in this statute at all?       What does the statute say about imputation of individuals' residence to grandparents?       It says nothing about it.     So, would you say the statute is ambiguous on whether or not residents' legal permanent residence status should be imputed to grandparents?       I suppose one of the things he could take into account in exercising his discretion is whether we're actually dealing with a minor, or, as I understand in this case, it's someone who is quite a bit older.       You -- you said you had two points.     Do you want to get your second out, in half a sentence?
10-174 +++$+++        Thank you, General. General Underwood. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       What -- what is the -- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that would have to be undertaken to decide what level of emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of global -- global warming?       Obviously the greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of course, to shut down the power plants, right?       Because -- right. But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of dealing with global warming is that there are costs and benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how much you want to readjust the world economy to address global warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden to post -- to impose on a district court judge.       We're dealing with an electric grid that connects I don't know how vast an area, but certainly a vast area here.     And the fact that they can reduce their emissions in a way that doesn't affect their customers is based on the fact that other power plants that are part of the grid will serve part of those -- will serve the customers' needs to some extent.       I -- I suppose there were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and your suit would override those determinations.       How much -- how much regulation do you need before you would admit that there is displacement?     Is it -- is it a preemption analysis that you're adopting or a displacement analysis?       What is -- what is your test for displacement?     When do we tell whether there's displacement or not?     Has there been some displacement in this case but just not total displacement or -       That sounds like - that sounds like preemption to me and not displacement, or at least preemption with another label.       Well, maybe you can tell me in what -- to what extent displacement is different from preemption.     Tell me in this area you're going to have displacement but not preemption.     Or I guess it's the other way around, in which there's going to be preemption but not -- well, what's the difference? You said in response to Justice Kagan that if they've made a considered decision that this is the amount and no other amount higher or lower, then there would be displacement.     In what way is that different from preemption?       I think you're right that under your theory they operate pretty similarly and I thought the whole point of Milwaukee v. Illinois was that they are two very distinct propositions.       Well, why do you stop at U.S. emissions?     What percentage of worldwide emissions, every one of which I assume harms your clients, do these five power plants represent? Infinitesimal, right?       From power plants or total emissions?       Do you agree -- General Katyal began his argument in fairly dramatic fashion by saying we've never in 222 years had a case where the relief, the damages and the relief sought, were as broad as they are here.     Do you have anything to rebut his proposition?     Any case where it has been as broad as it is here?       What's your best - what's your candidate to rebut his proposition?       A broader case with respect to the infliction of damage and the need for relief.       Well, not as many as contribute to global warming?       Well, no, it's not, and it's not true of every litigation in this sense, that everyone is harmed by global warming.     So unless you limit your suits to the States, which would -- I'm not aware of a principled basis for doing that -- every individual can bring -- every individual in the world if they can establish jurisdiction can bring one of these cause of -- causes of action.       Well, I guess, just to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing?     Is it reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the continuing validity of the injunction it entered previously?       But that seems to be a displacement of the normal process of administrative law, which we would review the agency's determination of how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions.       Yes.     And I guess that's the central problem.     Once you turn it over to litigation, it's an entirely different set of standards that would regulate emissions as opposed to the standards that would apply with respect to an agency's determination.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
10-209 +++$+++        Ms. Newman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF VALERIE R. NEWMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       You said -- you said earlier that the district court, the trial court judge, still retains discretion as to whether or not to approve the plea bargain, right, whether to accept it?       Yes -- well, which is it, the bargain or the sentence?     It includes the sentence, correct?       He has discretion -- he has discretion.       So, is he allowed to take into consideration all that's happened before, not just with respect to guilt or innocence or the result of the trial, but in imposing the sentence or approving it?       But nothing that he learned at trial, I take it.       So, if you're the defense counsel, the best thing for you to do is not communicate any plea offer you get, and then if your client is found guilty, then you can go back and say, oh, by the way, I didn't tell you about this, and he gets a whole new trial.       A deficient performance --       So, how are you ever going to know that the defendant would have accepted the plea agreement?     Because by not accepting it, he's got a chance of going scot-free.     He's going to have a fair trial, that's the assumption; and he may be acquitted. So, how is a judge supposed to say -- I mean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would have taken that deal, because it's better.     Well, how is a judge supposed to go back and decide whether that's true or not?       Why?       How is the judge --       How is the judge -- how is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide, whether the defendant would have accepted the deal or not?       It's the defendant's choice; it's not the lawyer's choice.     It's the defendant's choice.       That's the ineffectiveness question.     I understand that to be taken out of the case by the concessions on the other side. I'm talking about the prejudice question.       How is a judge supposed to know?       People have different -- some people are willing to take the chance. Okay?     Let's assume there's a 20 percent chance the person will be found guilty. Some people will say, I'm willing to take that chance because I just don't want the chance of going to jail; I'm willing to roll the dice.     Other people will say, no, that's too much. Now, whether you want to go to jail may cut one way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to decide?     Ask him, are you -- do you take chances?       So, the judge should decide whether he would take the deal.       Look at the evidence before him and say, boy, I'd take that deal. (Laughter.)       But you can never say that there's no possibility of acquittal.     Juries can decide not to convict no matter what the evidence.       That's up to the jury.     It's not up to us ex ante to decide this guy is definitely going to lose; so, let's not waste our time. Juries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not -- it's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide for whatever reason we are not going to convict this guy.     Right?       You said there's -- I want to make sure I understand your point.     You said there was no defense.     Does that mean you didn't -- he had a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put on a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove the case and they haven't done it.       Did he -- did he --       Oh.       That's something the jury could have accepted, right?     Even if it's not legally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the person below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can see a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend to kill her.     He shot her, you know, below the waist. Maybe that is not such a bad strategy.
10-218 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. 18                 Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 20                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      But we're talking 24     about the land at the bottom of the -- the river.    What 25     is it that the State can't do on the navigable waterways that it wants to do?      No, but I'm not sure 20     it has the same consequences.    It seems to me that 21     regardless of who prevails in this case, the State will 22     be able to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over the 23     waters.    You know, you can't fish during these seasons, 24     or there are different limits on how many fish you can 25     take.    And so will the Federal Government.    It will be able to apply Federal law to the river regardless of who 2     owns parts of the river, regardless of who owns the land 3     underneath.      Without regard -- 9     but I would say without regard to whether they happened 10     to own the land under the -- under the river or not. 11                 MR. GARRE important intrusion on State sovereignty as this Court 18     has always understood under the equal footing doctrine 19     and the public trust doctrine. And you also have the problem of competing 21     regulation of these rivers when you go from mile to 22     mile, interruption to interruption, potentially 23     thousands along rivers.    And that's laid out in the 24     brief by the environmental groups here, the National 25     Wildlife Foundation and Trout Unlimited and other groups, that talk about the problems with fragmented 2     regulatory jurisdiction. And you also get into the question of public 4     access for fishing, too.    The rivers are used for commerce, but the public trust doctrine was always used 6     to protect access to rivers for fishing, too.    And so, 7     if you look at a place like the Great Falls or the 8     Thompson Falls, these are among the most sought-after 9     fishing rivers in the world.      We haven't talked 14     much about the Madison.    What -- what is your best piece 15     of evidence with respect to the Madison for the 16     proposition that it was navigable at statehood?
10-224 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN K. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       But they don't -- you don't know whether they're going to become meat until after the Federal process of post-mortem inspection and all of that.     And your rules seem to prohibit that.       No, but I mean your -- your argument up to this point has been that this doesn't interfere with the Federal laws because the Federal laws are designed only to deal with meat that is for consumption.     And you say with your -- with respect to your animals, that's not what it is. But here, as I understand the Petitioner's and the Government's position, it is that nonambulatory animals can be turned into meat for consumption.     So, you don't know whether it fits under the definition of the State law until you've violated it.       So, your argument is that because the Act doesn't speak to whether or not cats and dogs and horses can be sold as meat, you can also say it's not within the scope because it doesn't speak to specifically whether nonambulatory animals can be sold as meat or not.       Well, that seems to me -- what you're saying then with respect to animals that are slaughtered in a slaughterhouse is that the difference is that the State law says you can't sell that as meat while the Federal law says you can.     Right? In other words, you're saying, well, just because the Federal law says you can doesn't mean that the State can't say you can't.       Correct?     Well, isn't the exact flip side of saying you can sell it is that -- that you can't sell it is that you can.     So, when the Federal law says you can, that pre-empts the rule from the States that says you can't.       What -- what purpose does the ban on buying and selling have, other than to implement the restrictions that go to operations?       But that seems to me to be, the answer, that, no, it doesn't have anything else to do because the animal cruelty that you're concerned about takes place on the premises as a result of the operations.     And so, you prohibit the buying and selling of an animal that wasn't treated the way you think it should be treated, to give effect to your views on how it should or should not be treated, which seems to be expressly pre-empted.       What does it include besides swine?       Those are -- those all go through slaughterhouses?

10-238 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRADLEY S. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       But counsel, how - the supposition that it results in more speech, let's take the independent expenditure example.     You've got one candidate running against three others.     There's an independent expenditure on behalf of the one candidate. That means, say $10,000.     That means each of the other three get $10,000 of their own.     Now, that might promote more speech, but the effect may well be for the independent expenditure to say, I'm not going to spend the money, and so the other candidates don't get the money and you have less speech.       How would you - what would that evidence look like?       Well, other than somebody saying it, I'm just curious what the evidence would look like.     You're -- it's -- you're proving a negative.     You're saying, well, this person didn't do something because of this, and that's pretty hard to do.       So -- so the idea is this is a way of encouraging candidates to take the public financing, right?       Would it encourage more candidates to do that if you doubled the amount that was available for every additional amount that the privately financed candidate spends?     He spends $1,000 over the amount and the publicly financed candidate gets $2,000.     A lot more people are going to do the publicly financing route if that were the case.       But that's kind of an odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it? That you get a 100 percent matching as opposed to, say, 110 percent or 150 percent?     Somewhere in the First Amendment the line is drawn on the amount?       So it doesn't work?       On that, there's a back and forth about the record and common sense.     As a matter of common sense -- I think this has already been asked -- if you knew that a $10,000 expenditure that you would make that would support a candidate would result in $30,000, 40,000, 50,000, depending on how many opposition candidates there were available for them, wouldn't you think twice about it?       Well, if you're thinking twice and one way you're thinking is not to do it, that sounds like a sufficient burden.       Our cases, as you know, have drawn a distinction between expression and disclosure.       Your focus on persuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a particular view of the political process that may not be applicable in every case.     Political scientists sometimes tell you that it's not persuasion, but simply playing to your base, getting them more actively involved.     So it's not the somewhat more academic view that people are going to sit down and just regard which one is persuasive.     Is that a permissible objective for the State to pursue, to value a particular view of the electoral process over another?       Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Jay. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY, ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       Counsel, do you agree that under our precedents, leveling the playing field for candidates is not a legitimate State purpose?       Well, I checked the Citizens' Clean Elections Commission website this morning, and it says that this act was passed to, quote, "level the playing field" when it comes to running for office.     Why isn't that clear evidence that it's unconstitutional?       Why -- why do you think the elections commission then tells us its purpose is to level the playing field?

Several thousand stores.     How many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?     I assume with three -- however many thousands of stores, you're going to have some bad apples.       No, I know there are examples.     How many do you need to have?       Surely it won't be -- if somebody sends one letter in saying the guy at this plant -- is -- plant -- this store is discriminating, that can't be enough to support your theory.       Is it -- is it true that Wal-Mart's pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?       What if you had a situation where you had a company with a very clear policy in favor of equal treatment of men and women? You know, the answer to your -- the answer to your question was women don't have as many positions because managers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and in promotion, yet you still have the same subjective delegation system. Could you have a class of women who were harmed by this subjective policy, even though it was clear that the policy of the corporation favored equal employment opportunity?       No, no, no, they still -- well, then you're saying it is not enough that it be a subjective decision.     This company has a thousand stores, and sure enough in a thousand stores you're going to be able to find a goodly number who aren't following the company's policy, who are exercising their subjective judgment in a way that violates the right to equal treatment. Couldn't you bring a class of people subjective to discrimination as a result of that subjective policy?       Counsel -       Thank you, counsel.

Our system has concluded that it works best if people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my concern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer -- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a trustee -       -- and if you know that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary, you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee. And that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also the beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid legal advice.       So how does -- I appreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid legal advice?     In every case, isn't the -- the lawyer - concerning his dealings with the beneficiary, with the trust:     I don't know if I have to do this or I have to do this.       And it seems to me if the -- if the information is always going to be shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going to get hedged advice.       Well, that's always a question of liability.     If he messes up and doesn't manage it the way he's supposed to, he will be liable. So the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a workable one.       So I'm the trustee, and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I should renegotiate this lease with the government.       Now, I want that advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm going to be sued.     Now is the document from the lawyer responding to that inquiry privileged or not?       So if he says this is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged. If he says this is what I'm going to do -       So under your theory if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the government's behalf, presumably the district court would conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was retrospective for liability or prospective for responsibility?       Well, they -- they could be retrospective, too, right?     The government exposes itself to liability, obviously, in these areas as well.     That's the basis for your suit, right?       I suppose the government as a whole has an obligation to act in the best interests of the citizenry, right?     Why doesn't the same theory apply to any citizen? Look, government, you're supposed to - you're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with respect to me.     You're supposed to be acting in my best interests.     If you're getting advice from the, you know, Department of Justice about what to do, I'm entitled to get that.       Are there any other -- are there any other areas in which the government's relationship to particular groups of citizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary?       What are some of those?       And your argument could be applied to them?       So if I'm a government retiree, I have the ability to get the legal advice that whoever it is that runs that trust gets?       The trustee I guess is -- is broadly conceived of as the government?       Well, isn't the lawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an employee of the trustee?       Thank you, Mr. Gordon.
10-444 +++$+++        Mr. Queener. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EMMETT D. QUEENER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, we get a lot of Strickland cases, and the lower courts do, too.       That's not much comfort in terms of what the consequences of a decision in your favor would be.       Counsel --       No, go ahead.       Counsel --       I'll go this time. Counsel, on page 24 of your brief, you quote Alford for the proposition that a valid plea must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.       On the next page, you say when Frye entered his guilty plea before the trial court, he was completely unaware that counsel's ineffective delay had forever foreclosed those options. Now, I put the two of those together and find you saying that this was a valid plea.       The question of validity is whether it's an intelligent choice, as you quote, among the alternative choices of action open to the defendant.     The next page you say these options have forever been foreclosed.     So, they weren't open to the defendant.
10-507 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Palmore. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT       Well, but it's a little -- it's a little different when you're talking about a labor practice and an activity that results in an injury.     Labor practice by its terms is going to have applicability to a particular location.     So, you would expect them to use that type of language.     It doesn't carry the same negative implication you're suggesting under 1333(b).       What if -- but what if that exposure is not pertinent to what they're doing? Let's take the same individual, 98 percent of the time on the rig and 2 percent on land.     An emergency comes up.     They need a new part, and they say:     Here, go -- you know, go drive to Reno where they have a new part and bring it back.     And he skids off the road and is injured.     Is he really covered by the Offshore Act?       Well, so, he's subject -- he's injured by, you know, a hazard on the road to Reno.     He's -- I don't know how many miles that is from the offshore, and yet he's still covered by the Offshore Act?       I'm sorry; I don't understand the answer.     So, he's covered by both?       Oh.       Please.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT       Well, I mean, both positions --       Both positions, Mr. Frederick, are vulnerable to particular hypotheticals. You have imprecision on what it means to spend most of your time on the -- on the shelf, and they have their own problems.     And what do you do with somebody who's -- 3 months he's on the shelf, and then 3 months he's back -- back on land 3 months?     Does it depend when the injury occurs, whether it's when he's on the land part of his job or on the shelf part?       Well, that's -- I've given you all the totality.     He's working for 3 months, and then he's -- you know, it's seasonal or something, and 3 months he's on -- on the land.     That is the totality of the circumstances.       Why?       Where -- how do you know it's the kind of person?     I thought your line was whether or not he spends most of his time on the shelf or most of his time somewhere else.       Thirty percent is the line?       Well, I know, but we'd like to have a test that we apply to your situation, and it's nice to know -- maybe 30 percent, I guess, is as good as any.       Unless he spent 30 percent of his time on the shelf.     Then he's covered.       Well, that's a real -- obviously, it's a real mishmash, and maybe that's what we're -- we're stuck with.     How does this work as a practical matter?     I assume the -- the companies get insurance to cover their risks here.       Who decides -- I mean, the insurance company will underwrite how many people spend what percentage of time where?       No -- well, they have to pay higher insurance rates.     To say they're not liable for it I think is a real --       Well, but you -- I don't mean to get back to it all the time, but it's not -- you have to say that Congress contemplated the person who spent 30 percent of his time on the outer continental shelf.     In terms of us coming up with a test.     Maybe your client is an easy case, where it's 98 percent.     But the test you want us to adopt covers the person who spends 70 percent of his time on land.

10-5400 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Cahn. Mr. Roberts. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF VACATUR       What if -- what if the judge sentences people who commit robbery with assault typically to 1 year; he can do it 1 to 2 years, he gives them 1 year; except whenever the presentencing report says the person has a drug problem and there's a one-and-a-half-year drug program in the prison, he sentences those people to one and a half years? Regularly.     But each time he says I recognize rehabilitation is not a permitted factor; I can send sentence this person to one to two, I'm going to pick one and a half.       Is that a problem, or does it always just depend on what the judge says?       It's wrong -- wrong to do what?       Does the defendant have the right to raise arguments and inquire into that in -- in every case?     Say that, well, he did say this was just to -- just to punish me, but here is a list of 10 cases where I think it's like my case and those people got less.       Well, I think it's going to be hard for the government to defend a sentence under those circumstances.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bibas.

10-5443 +++$+++        Ms. Harrington. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Isn't -- if you have a Federal -- underlying Federal offense, and I gather you don't think -- that just needs to be shown as a matter of fact, right?       No intent with respect to that. Isn't it always likely that there's going to be a reasonable possibility, reasonable likelihood, that the communication is going to go to a Federal officer?       It's a Federal offense.     If the communication covers Federal judges, that's the person who is going to try the case in every case.       No, obviously not all of them.       So you think that - that it's not an element of the crime, but that feature of the prosecution depends upon what percentage of the crimes are prosecuted Federally as opposed to by State law?       Can you instruct the jury that the underlying crime here is a Federal crime and then say the only thing they have to determine under some standard is whether or not the communication would be to a Federal officer?       But why isn't that -- maybe I asked this already, but why isn't that the case when you're dealing with the Federal offense?       Oh, but there's a possibility.       A realistic possibility.
10-545 +++$+++        General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       General, there is something at least at an intuitive level appealing about Mr. Falzone's First Amendment argument.     One day I can perform Shostakovich; Congress does something, the next day I can't.     Doesn't that present a serious First Amendment problem?       All right.     Well, that's --       That's -- one answer is that Congress has done this before.       Right.       Okay.     Well, do you have an argument other than that they've -- they've done this before?       But we have -- but it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas, right?     It's a different analysis if your claim is the government should open up a park as a public forum, than if it's been a public forum for 200 years and the government decides to close it down.     Maybe they can do it, but it's a different question. So, why isn't this a different question, from whether they can extend copyright protection that's already there?       Well, what about -- what about Jimi Hendrix, right?     He has a distinctive rendition of the national anthem, and all of a -- assuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to copyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do that, right?       So, he's just out of luck?     And that's just one example of many, where you take existing works and you have a derivative work or something that is distinctive to you.     So, those people are just out of luck?       Even under -- even under rational basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the interest weighed on the other side of the -- the restriction of free speech rights -- it's hard to say that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in every case.
10-553 +++$+++        You may. Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT       Is the position of the United States that there is a ministerial exception or that there is not a ministerial exception?       Nothing to do with respect to the ministers.     In other words, is there a ministerial exception distinct from the right of association under the First Amendment?       Is there anything special about the fact that the people involved in this case are part of a religious organization?       Is that a "no"?     You say it's similar to other cases.     Expressive associations -- a group of people who are interested in labor rights have expressive associations.     Is the issue we are talking about here in the view of the United States any different than any other group of people who get together for an expressive right?       I'm sorry.     That was a yes -- I think that question can be answered yes or no.       So, you're making -- you're making a judgment about how important a particular religious belief is to a church.     You're saying -- this may just be the same question Justice Alito asked -- but you're saying:     We don't believe the Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important and central tenet of our faith.       On the other hand, the -- the belief of the Catholic Church that priests should be male only -- you do defer to that, even if the Lutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is just as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy is to a Catholic.       Thank you, Ms. Kruger. ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT       Mr. Dellinger.       Justice Kagan. (Laughter.)       Those are important. So, he is not a minister?
10-568 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Elwood. Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA E. ROSENKRANZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So if the legislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're going to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to pass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of someone in the minority, and you can challenge that on First Amendment grounds?       Counsel, I've kind of lost the thread of your argument.     Is this a vagueness claim or a First Amendment claim?     I gather your claim is going to be the same even if the statute clearly said family members, you know, business partners, and political consultants.       Is your vagueness argument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own?       So we can decide your vagueness -- if we agree with you on vagueness, we don't have to determine whether the First Amendment applies in this type of situation?       Here we're talking about penalty for participating.     What -- what if it's a disclosure rule saying, you know, you can participate, you can vote, you can advocate, you just have to disclose interest of this sort.       Is that problematic under -       Right.     Well, doesn't that burden his First Amendment rights?

Well, no, but I think your friend's argument, which has some appeal, is 7206 is fraud and false statements.     And he said if you're right that that includes deceit, they wouldn't have had to add "with the intent to evade tax," which is what they do in 6501(c)(1).
10-6 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cruz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT       How was the jury instructed?       I am still waiting to hear what it was?       Well, I thought there was some question about that it was so low that it in effect amounted to a negligence standard.       I am a little confused about the relationship between knowledge and the Grokster standard.     You think knowledge is a more favorable standard for Petitioner than Grokster.     You're willing to accept Grokster, but not willing to accept actual knowledge.       Well, before you tell me why, do you understand -- it's unfair to ask you, I guess, but I understood Petitioner to take the opposite position:     That Grokster was a more favorable standard for him than actual knowledge.       A high probability of what?     A high probability that you will infringe this -- a patent or any patent?
10-63 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Neiman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. NEIMAN, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Let's say the three notices are sent out; all three of them come back, okay? Let's even go further and say the prosecutor knows that nobody representing Mr. Maples received notice.     What happens then?       My question is what happens?     Are you prepared to acknowledge that in that case, Mr. Maples had been abandoned by all of his lawyers, it was known to the prosecution, and, therefore, the failure to file the notice should not constitute an adequate and independent State ground barring collateral relief?       What was the point of it?     He must have thought there was a problem, right?       So, you accept -- I don't mean to interfere with the question, but -- so, you accept the idea that there is a distinction between malfeasance and abandonment.       Okay.     So, then the only thing -- the only thing we're talking about is whether, on these particular facts, there has been abandonment or not.     Right?       From your perspective.       But you agreed with me earlier that abandonment is an exception to the adequate and independent State grounds.     So, under your view of the case, Coleman was not necessarily controlling.       Is it correct or does the notice -- most of the notices I see list the people who have been served.     Were the New York people listed on the notice that went to Butler?       Well, then he knew he wasn't the only one getting notice.       Or he knew that he was the only one who was supposed to get notice.       You said a few moments ago that Butler did more than your friend suggested.     What more did he do?       Well, after the default, sure.     But what did he do before?       What did he do more than that?       Well, you made a fairly serious suggestion that your friend had not accurately represented what Butler did.     And you still haven't told me one thing he did more than move the admission of the out-of-town attorneys.       Sure.
10-637 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Eisenberg. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       I'm sorry.     If I could just go back to your Pinholster point.     Your friend makes the argument that, of course, in a typical appellate case, you don't go back and revisit the facts, but that appellate court is expected to apply the law at the time it renders its decision.     So, there is that distinction between law and facts that seems to cut in his favor.       Well, I'm talking more generally about the idea that Pinholster automatically applies to this situation.     It applies to facts; therefore, it applies to law.     The distinction in that context between law and facts, the general context, strikes me as one that supports his argument that they're at least not tied at the hip and have to be treated the same way.       What is the State -- its a hypothetical -- and I don't mean to give you an opportunity for a self-serving answer, but what would the State have done if he had filed a petition and said: My case was controlled by Gray; you the Supreme Court should grant, vacate and remand.     Are you aware of situations where the State has agreed with such a request?       No, no.     I'm talking about your office's position in responding to a petition for cert.       Have you ever said, yes, Gray controls; that's different, you, the Supreme Court?     We see it.
10-6549 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sherry. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So, your -- your argument is that "requirements" in the heading for 42 U.S.C. 16913, Registration requirements for sex offenders, means something different than "requirements" in subsection (d), which the Attorney General can issue rules about, because you're saying, although there is the requirement that they register and comply with (c) and all those other things, when it says that the Attorney General can issue regulations specifying the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter, that only meant the administration, you know, provisions, not the general requirement that you register and keep current and all that.       It's a safety valve to release what?       Well, you are talking about sort of in the weeds, the little details, not the underlying requirement of registration, right?       You want to share it with the rest of us?       Why -- why isn't part of your answer to Justice Breyer's question that the one person who doesn't have to register for 4 years is in prison already; so, presumably, he doesn't present the same type of threat that led to the enactment of these registration laws in the first place?       And providing criminal penalties that weren't always there.       That's a big change.       Your theory -       Your theory of what the Attorney General did here, as you put in your -- I forget what, the regulations or the -- was confirm the applicability of SORNA, right?       That's the word you used, I think, on page 12 of your brief.       Right.       What is the other example -- do you have any other example where an Attorney General confirms the applicability of a criminal law?       No, that's different.     I mean, if you're talking about defining which drugs are qualified, you know, under provisions that criminalize possession, things like that.     That's is clarification going forward.     I'm talking about straightforward confirming, which is what you say happened here.       You know, the law says this, and I -- I think it means -- I think it means what -- what you say it means.       So, I get back to my question, which -- what's your best example of an Attorney General doing something like that?       Well, here it says "shall."     It says, "The Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subsection."       What if -- what if we think the reason Congress left it to the Attorney General is because they just didn't want to decide?     Or some people were saying this is fine but not retroactive, and others were saying it should be retroactive.     Do you see any constitutional issues with Congress delegating that authority to the Attorney General, the authority to make a criminal statute applicable on a retroactive basis?
10-680 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Now Ms. Jacobs. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH L. JACOBS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, Justice Ginsburg is quite right.     That -- that was not the issue in Mathis.     The argument in Mathis was:     We're questioning him about something else; so, we don't have to give him Miranda warnings.     And that's the question that the Court decided.     I don't think it had any discussion about whether -- there was certainly not the argument of whether he was in custody or not.     The argument was this is a different crime; so, we don't have to give you Miranda. And the Court rejected that.     So how does that clearly establish the law on which the court relied in this case?       Right.       Right.       Do you know where exactly in Mathis?     It's only --   -- about five pages long.     Can you show me where they have that discussion about custody, as opposed to a discussion about what crime is being discussed?       Exactly.       Exactly.     It's implied.     Inferred.     How --       Is that clearly established law?       Do you agree that this is not -- what you want to derive from Mathis is not part of the holding of Mathis?       It's an extension.       I'm not sure you answered mine from before.       How do you think that your argument or the decision of the court below was implicit in or an extension of Mathis?     Mathis says you don't -- you're not free of Miranda just because it's a different crime.     How does that answer the issue before the Sixth Circuit in this case?       Well, I thought what we've been arguing about is not the nexus issue, but instead whether, in light of the circumstances or under an absolute rule, there's custody.       And what is the clearly established law set forth in our cases that answers that latter question?       Can I -- since we're talking about the Sixth Circuit decision, what it says is -- this is on page 10a.     "The central holding of Mathis is that a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population and interrogated, i.e., questioned in a manner likely to lead self-incrimination about conduct occurring outside of the prison."     Is that correct --       -- description of Mathis?       I thought Mathis rejected the argument that it depends on whether the crime is the one that you're in prison for or something else.       Well -- the first part, "a Miranda warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population" -- okay -- "and interrogated"; i.e., questioned in a manner or whatever.     Now, does that address all of the issues?     Is that -- where in Mathis is the discussion about whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population?       No, no.     Where in Mathis?       Right.       If the argument were Miranda was not required because this -- this concerns a different crime than what you're in prison for here.     I understand the idea that -- under AEDPA, that Mathis is clearly established law.     The issue here, however, as the Sixth Circuit put it, is a warning is required whenever an incarcerated individual is isolated from the general prison population.     And I just don't see that anywhere in Mathis.       Okay.       Isn't the best you can say, not that Mathis found but perhaps that Mathis apparently assumed that he was in custody, because there is no discussion of it? There's no discussion of the custody.       Yes, they give you a factual recital.     He was in his cell and all that.       What's dicta?     Dicta is something that's said that's not necessary to the holding.       We don't have anything that's said about it here.       Counsel, you -- you mentioned several times, we were talking about Mathis, that, you know, they mentioned he was in -- in a cell, right?     I've just been skimming it quickly.     I don't see where that's mentioned.     Do you know offhand?       And I --       I did, too.     And -- well, I'll look at it again.     I'm sure --       I'm sure it's there. All I see is noting that he was in prison serving a State sentence, but --       Okay.     Let me --

Counsel, if I could stop you and just have you address the political question doctrine.       You say this is exclusively committed to the President, and, therefore, it is a non-justiciable political question.     How is that different from saying it's our job to decide cases, it is justiciable, and then you can argue that the answer of that analysis is that it's exclusively committed to the President?     I don't understand why labeling it a political question advances the analysis much.       What if -       What if Congress's statute said what you must put on the passport, if requested, is "Israel," parentheses, ("Disputed"), close parentheses?     Which would seem to take care of your objection that people are going to look at this and draw a false conclusion.       It is the position of the administration, isn't it, that the status of Jerusalem is disputed?       So, what if Congress says, in the place that you have it, this person has the choice of whether or not to put "Jerusalem" or "Israel"? This doesn't affect whether the United States recognizes Jerusalem as part of Israel or not; it's just his choice.     Same problem?       Really?       I thought your argument was that someone's going to look at that and say that -- that offends me, that you're calling this part of Israel.     That was the foreign policy significance.     And I tried to give you a hypothetical in which nobody could reasonably draw that conclusion, and you say still, same thing.      And what you told -      You told -- you told Justice Kagan that it didn't -- your position didn't depend upon a textual commitment, that your position would be the same if the Receive Ambassadors Clause were not in the Constitution.       That sounds to me like not in the text.       I will give you a couple more minutes.     If my colleagues have any questions?       Do you want to answer?
10-704 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. 21                 Mr. Wolfson. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON 23                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS      Here you had a 23     police officer who assembled information he had, truthful information, in the affidavit, submitted it to 25     his superiors, who were lawyers.    Then it was submitted to the magistrate, who was a judge.    And what you have 2     to say, it seems to me, is that a reasonably competent 3     officer -- not objective good faith or anything like 4     that -- a reasonable -- reasonably competent officer 5     would say:    You know, I know the lawyers in the office 6     said this was okay and I know the judge said it was 7     okay, but I know more than them; I know not only that 8     it's not okay, but it's so clearly not okay that I 9     shouldn't have qualified immunity. That seems to me a pretty heavy burden to 11     put on -- put on the cop on the beat.      We've been talking -- we've been talking about this for some time 10     as if we're reviewing the adequacy of the warrant. 11     We're not.    We're reviewing the reasonableness of these 12     officers' determination that there was probable cause. 13                 Do you think it is at all pertinent in 14     addressing that question that the officers submitted the 15     affidavit to support the warrant to Deputy District 16     Attorney Jane Wilson, who reviewed it and signed off on 17     it?      I didn't ask if it's 21     dispositive.    Is it relevant in any way?      Do you want -- do 3     you want to encourage officers, when they're applying 4     for search warrants, to have them reviewed by the deputy 5     district attorney or not?      Did they enter the 7     residence?      Your answer -- and, 16     again, it seems to me we keep separating these two 17     inquiries.    It's not whether the warrant showed adequate 18     probable cause; it's whether or not the officers were 19     reasonable in believing that it did.      And to cite Groh, 22     a -- no reasonable officer could think that a warrant 23     that doesn't say anything at all about what's to be 24     seized complied with the Fourth Amendment.      Counsel, do you -- 16     do you contend that anything in the affidavit was false? 17                 MR. WOLFSON      -- may have been -- 8     may have staying there?
10-708 +++$+++       Well, that gets to a 3     point that I'm having trouble getting my arms around. 4     It seems to me what your position is, what you want us 5     to focus on, there are three possible arguments.    One is 6     that there is injury-in-fact in this case.    I see some 7     of that argument in your briefs.    Two, that Congress 8     presumes injury-in-fact.    Injury-in-fact is still 9     required, but that is presumed.    I read that to be 10     perhaps what the trust cases say.    Or, three, that 11     injury-in-fact is not required at all.    Now, which are 12     you arguing?    One, two or three?      Okay, statutory 17     right.      Can I -- I'm sorry 20     to interrupt you, and I want to pause on that question. 21     You said violation of a statute is injury-in-fact.    I 22     would have thought that would be called injury-in-law. 23     And when we say, as all our standing cases have, is that 24     what is required is injury-in-fact, I understand that to 25     be in contradistinction to injury-in-law.    And when you tell me all that you've got or all that you want to 2     plead is violation of the statute, that doesn't sound 3     like injury-in-fact.      Okay.    Now, that 10     goes back to the first proposition.    That's an argument 11     that there is injury-in-fact here.    So, it seems to me 12     that -- I don't mean this in a pejorative sense, but it 13     seems to me that you slide back and forth between one, 14     two, and three, which makes it hard for us to get a 15     decision.      Potential -- 22     potential value.      Now, we said in the Whitmore case, and this is a quote:    "Allegations of 2     possible future injury do not satisfy the requirements 3     of Article III."    Potential value sounds to me like 4     possible future injury.      So, that's 13     injury-in-fact?      But I thought -- and maybe it's a unique circumstance in this case, but Ohio 2     says this is going to cost you the same no matter what 3     you do.      Okay.    But then 7     again, that's an argument about was there or was there 8     not injury-in-fact.      That sounds -- 20     again, to use a word we've said is inadequate to support 21     standing, that sounds conjectural.      No, no, no.    We're talking about not what Congress found; what the 2     injury-in-fact is.      Now we're in point 13     -- now we're at level two      So, you would accept 21     $1 in this case?      Well, no, that -- 3     that gets -- I didn't mean to be facetious, but it gets 4     to the question of whether or not you have to actually 5     show injury-in-fact.    Your allegation in this case is 6     for damages, not just nominal damages but damages. 7                 MR. LAMKEN      So, do you -- I'm 2     sorry.      Do you want to get 8     out of this contract?      Do you want to get 11     out of this deal?      I didn't see -- I 19     didn't see an allegation for rescission or -- or, you 20     know -- so, you're perfectly happy as far as we know 21     from the complaint with this deal; you just want the 22     extra $500 per class member without showing any 23     injury-in-fact.      You -- you don't 14     want a conflict-free transaction because you don't want 15     to get out of this contract.    You're perfectly happy 16     with the contract.    You want $500.    You don't want a 17     conflict-free transaction, because even if it was a -- 18     were a conflict-free transaction, the price would be the 19     same, in Ohio.      Okay.    Now, there 24     the answer to my question -- and I don't mean to focus 25     on a peculiar structure, but there -- your answer was on      Can I ask you, just 24     to follow up -- you said whether or not there's further 25     economic harm.    So, you say economic harm is required --      -- because there 3     can't be further economic harm if there isn't economic 4     harm in the first place.      Okay.      Thank you, 15     Mr. Lamken. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 19                      SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT      What -- why do we 3     always say injury-in-fact then?    You say so long as the 4     harm is a violation of the law, a legally protected 5     interest.    Our standing cases always say injury-in-fact 6     as opposed to injury-in-law.    And yet, you're saying if 7     you violate the law, you have sufficient injury.      Real and immediate, 18     not conjectural or hypothetical.      The difference 7     between legal harm, though -- I mean, isn't that -- I 8     guess I'm just repeating myself.    Injury-in-fact -- how 9     do you understand that to be different than any other kind of injury?      There are two      You can -- the 2     trespass cases, it seems to me, are different because 3     you are talking about a property right, and you can sell 4     a property right.    You can go to somebody and say I have 5     the right to keep people off of this piece of property. 6     Do you want to buy it?    Here's how much it's worth.    But 7     if -- that's only a property right to the extent you can 8     keep people off of it. Here, no one's going to buy this right from 10     the -- the plaintiff, because everybody's got it anyway. 11     You don't -- you don't pay her, because she doesn't have 12     a tangible concrete right.    The trespass case, the 13     person obviously does, because he can sell it.      It's not really a 21     question, but you can answer. 22                 (Laughter.)

GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       But there is another interest here besides the State's concern about health care costs, and that is the physician's privacy interests.       You can sell this information to whomever you want, right?       You could sell to it a journalist who wants to expose physicians in a particular area who prescribe a lot of a particular medication.       So the public can discern well, this is the guy who is treating these people; we don't like these people, so we're going to Pickett outside his clinic.       Now, nothing prevents you from doing that, right?       Well, don't you think that's protecting physicians' privacy, to prevent that from happening?       You would have no objection I take it, if there were not the academic exception and if the State didn't -- didn't push its own contrary program?       How would -- if you were truly concerned about physician privacy -       You didn't want people to know that this physician prescribed this drug more often because it tells you a lot about his practice -       -- that he may not want known, how would you -- how would you write this statute?       Would you remind me what Justice Kennedy said? (Laughter.)       Okay.     Who's -       This -- this is, Mr. Kneedler explained this is the government's information. Why can't -- you wouldn't have to have it if it weren't prescription.     It was the fact that it has to be prescribed that requires this information.     The government frequently controls the use to which information can be put.     It makes me file a tax return, and it doesn't allow, you know, dissemination of that. It restricts it.       And presumably it could say that if an accountant prepares my tax return, that accountant can't sell it, either.       How is this any different?

What 6     page were you again?      But the alternative 19     is that the FDA is going to have to hire an awful lot of 20     patent lawyers to review the -- the use codes and their 21     correspondence to the actual patents.      Well, that's the way 13     agency action gets challenged when it's substantive 14     action.    The FDA's position -- the United States' 15     position is that this is purely ministerial act.      Maybe your colleague 16     can find it --      -- before your time 19     is finished.      But I'm still not 10     following it.    It's not listed simply because the number 11     is wrong?      The brand manufacturer has an overwhelming incentive to list the 25     correct patent, doesn't it?      Thank you, counsel. 14                 Mr. Hurst, you have 4 minutes. 15                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES F. HURST 16                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 17                 MR. HURST I'd like to start by asking the Court, if I 19     can, to turn to the Joint Appendix, second volume, 484. 20     And I want to address two issues:    the argument that the 21     use code is disconnected from the patent itself and it 22     -- it may relate to the indication regardless of what 23     the patent says, and whether or not the information is 24     being submitted under subsection (b) and (c). If you're at 484, this form went through notice-and-comment rulemaking before the enactment of 2     the counterclaim.    The title, "Patent Information Submitted" -- that -- that is a -- this carries out the 4     regulation 314.53, entitled "Submission of patent 5     information." Now look at right below those two boxes. 7     What does it say -- how does it say the information is 8     being submitted?    This is a form Novo signed.    "The 9     following is provided in accordance with section 10     505(b)" -- that's 355(b) and -- "(c) of the Federal 11     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act." Moreover, when the FDA issued this patent 13     submission regulation in its final rule, it cited 505 as 14     its legal authority.    That's at 28J of the Blue Book. 15     It cited -- and it specifically called out subsections 16     (b) and (c). So, this is a regulation that was enacted 18     prior to the enactment of the counterclaim.    And now -- 19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:    And what do you say about 20     the -- the section cited by -- by your colleague? 21                 MR. HURST:    We address -- he's citing 22     something the FDA said in 2007.    And if you actually 23     read it, we cited it -- we addressed this in our briefs. 24     It actually says our -- our legal authority for doing 25     this was explained fully in 2003.    And in 2003, the FDA cites 505. Can I turn you quickly to 487 now?    This 3     addresses quite specifically this notion that the 4     indication can be used even if it's disconnected from 5     the patent.    4.2b.    Remember what the regulation says, 6     and Justice Breyer read this before.    It's at 127a of 7     the appendix.    But the regulation says that the brand is 8     required to, quote, "the description of the patented 9     method of use as required for publication."    They're supposed to provide that information. And look what the actual instruction says. 12     It could not be more clear.    4.2b, bottom right side. 13     "The answer to this question" -- this is where the brand 14     supplies the use code -- "The answer to this question 15     will be what FDA uses to create a 'use code' for Orange 16     Book publication.    The use code designates a method of 17     use patent that claims the approved indication or use" 18     -- it depends on what the patent claims -- "of a drug 19     product." And then it goes on to explain why you need 21     to do that:    "Each approved use claimed by the patent 22     should be separately identified in this section and 23     contain adequate information" -- this refers to section 24     (viii) -- "adequate information to assist 505(b)(2) and 25     ANDA applicants" -- that's us -- "in determining whether a listed method of use patent claims a use for which the 2     ANDA applicant is not seeking."    That is precisely the 3     situation we are facing. We have offered a construction of this 5     statute that is fully consistent with its text, its 6     structure, and its purpose.    And it really is the only 7     reading of the statute that carries out congressional 8     intent in terms of trying to prevent situations where 9     incorrect patent information is unfairly delaying generic competition. Up to this point right now, Novo has still 12     failed to identify any reason why anybody in Congress 13     would want the system to work as Novo posits, where the 14     brand company gets to supply an overbroad use code, 15     without judicial review, without agency review, that 16     blocks admittedly noninfringing products from the 17     marketplace.    And I -- and I submit that given the 18     addition of the correction remedy, that would not be in 19     there if this was not designed to address use codes, 20     because that's the only thing that can be corrected 21     without remedy.

SHAH 13                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      But also, I gather, 19     it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers 20     that might want to sell part of the farm.    You know, 21     they have dairy and corn operations or something, and 22     they sell one to try to preserve the other.    And that's 23     -- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be 24     considered in the bankruptcy context.    And yet, your 25     position says we're going to treat it outside the bankruptcy.      But that's a big 11     deal if you're deciding how the plan's going to work, 12     whether they -- I mean, what the amount was here was big 13     for the farmer, and the idea of, well, we're going to 14     pretend that's not at issue here seems to me to be -- 15     again, not -- not to make a lot of sense.      Well, it's certainly 15     not a self-denying position now, right?    You're arguing 16     that these are -- that the taxes of this sort are 17     administrative expenses when that puts you at the head 18     of the line.    You're arguing that they are not administrative expenses, same type of taxes, when it 20     puts you at the back of the line, even though the 21     provision that puts you at the back of the line was 22     designed to particularly help the fishermen and -- and 23     farmers.      Well, but then 16     you're saying that Congress changed the rules in a way 17     that, as Justice Alito's question suggested, really 18     doesn't do much at all, when what they wanted to do was 19     provide some real protection for farmers and fishermen. 20                 MR. SHAH      But those are -- 18     those are small potatoes compared to the sale of a farm 19     and a boat, right?

I'm sorry --       If -- if we think it's necessary to set some objective limit on how long an inherent authority could be exercised, is there any reason to adopt any limit, other than the one that the psychiatrists have suggested, which is, I gather, most people, if they're going to, will recover competence within 9 months?       So if we're looking for a little more guidance than that and feel the need for an objective standard, other than abuse of discretion, you don't have any number that has any basis in psychiatric evidence or anything else, besides the 9 months?       Nobody here thinks today -- no one's arguing that it prevents any kind of stay today, right?       No.     I didn't understand -- I thought everybody was focusing on limitation on stays.

Well, so how -- what is this 9 months or 1 year?     The amount of time he's under treatment or the amount of time from the district court determination?
10-945 +++$+++        Okay.     Thank you. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       I'm sorry.     Is the shower and look at you cursorily -- are those separate things?     Or is it during the shower?       Because your friend places a lot of significance on how close -       -- the examination is.     So, under that policy, how close was the examination?       Well, that's not right.     They could take -       That's not right. You could take the clothes off, put them in a bin -       The person examines the bin.       Yes.       I thought -- I thought your friend said that is exactly what you do with respect to the visual body cavity search, reasonable articulable suspicion, under the new policy.       Right.       Well, now, as I understand it, with respect to -       -- with respect to visual body cavity searches, you require a particular individual reason, right?       Okay.     And you don't require that with respect to simple strip search?       Okay.     So, you agree with your friend that the only thing at issue here is how close the guard is going to be to the individual who you have no reasonable suspicion to think is different than anybody else during a simple strip search?       You want -- he says feet is too close; 5 feet or whatever is okay.     You want to go to 2 feet.     You don't want to have to stand back to 6 feet.     That's all the case comes down to?       I'm not interested in what Essex policy permitted it to do in the past. I'm looking at the new policy, all right?     Under the new policy, you have reasonable articulable suspicion -       -- for everything except simple strip search and observation.       I'm sorry.     Could I finish and find out what you do?     You said:     We don't do that.     We do -- what?       Okay.     So, you do more than a simple strip search.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       I'm sorry.     I'm sure I missed something.     You say when they go in they're asked:     Will you consent to a more intrusive body cavity search and be put into the general population; or if you don't, you don't have to be searched and we put you in some place else.     Who consents to that? (Laughter.)

NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       What about the argument that the consumer retains the right to sue, since they can go into court with their complaint, but it's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is that you have to proceed to arbitration?       But that's frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues come up.     I mean, people --       -- who think they cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement or any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.

10-9646 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. Mr. Neiman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. NEIMAN, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      Counsel, when you it's a little confusing to me, but when you refer to "minimum," I assume that was because of the statutes prior to Graham had death as one of the other options, that that is no longer an option.     So, it's -- it's a little awkward to refer to it as minimum when it's also the maximum.       When you have -- when an individual is prosecuted for an aggravated murder that carries this sentence, is it typical to also charge lesser included offenses?       And -- and in general, what is the distinction between exposure to the -- the maximum crime and a lesser included crime? In other words, what is the difference between aggravated murder and manslaughter?     It typically turns on the state of mind, doesn't it?       So, is there any reason to think that juries in a case where they have the option for lesser included offenses might be concerned in light of the age of the defendant about whether or not the requisite intent was formed? It seems to me that some of the issues that we've suggested justify a different treatment of juveniles have to do with mental development, and those same issues would be taken into account by a jury in considering which of a list of offenses the juvenile should be convicted of.
10-98 +++$+++        Thank you, General. Mr. Gelernt. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE GELERNT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       The problem, and it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the case has to proceed so that we can prove that. One of the ways we prove that is by asking everybody who is involved in the process.     Why did you do this?     What was your intent?     I mean, the whole purpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't happen.       So every time the prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this wasn't designed to elicit testimony?       If you were writing a law review article, you might have done that.     But we're talking about an officer.     I think the first thing you would do is say, well, let me see these material witness statute cases, and what would he have found?       But, again, you're talking about the officer, he reads the statute and then doesn't say, well, but maybe the statute's unconstitutional, so I need to do more research?       So the eight - eight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing en banc below were just being unreasonable?     It would have been unreasonable for an officer making this determination to agree with eight judges from the Ninth Circuit?       What we said in Wilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a constitutional question, it is unfair to subject public employees to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.       Well, I agree with -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same time, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy burden on the officers in this area when do you have a situation where eight judges, when they conduct their research, come out the other way.     And that type of burden is particularly heavy when you're talking about if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket.     And if I'm the officer in that situation, I say, well, I'm just not going to run the risk of, you know, having to sell the house because I agreed with eight judges on the Court of Appeals.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       So, you're saying that if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a good state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win on that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you didn't raise it?

105, Orig. +++$+++                       Thank you, General. General Suthers. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. SUTHERS ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT                   So what if they said in original actions no fees shall be allowed to any special master appointed by the Supreme Court?                   If we allow -- if we allow Congress to regulate fees in our original jurisdiction in that matter, it seems to me that we've given up the principle and we are just negotiating over price.                    Isn't this an area, though, where we should be particularly sensitive?                 In other words, one reason that we were given original jurisdiction in these cases is that the States were afraid of what Congress would do in its own courts, the courts it set up -- might set up under the Constitution. I think it would be surprising if you told the States at the framing that Congress gets to regulate this original jurisdiction where you, for example, can sue the Federal Government, that -- I think that would be surprising.   It would not be regarded by them as a significant safeguard.                   Well, we would want to get into the business because it's our business; and it seems to me that if you yield on a basic point like this, that you're giving up, who knows how much?                   What if -- what if Congress had done nothing?          In other words, let's say they haven't addressed costs at all.                    Would we be able to set what we think are reasonable attendance costs?                  Pursuant to what authority?                  Well, if we have inherent authority over original jurisdiction cases, how does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress decides to legislate in the area?                  Is a substantive level of fees a mode of proceeding?                   Is there any -- do you think $40 a day for an expert is a realistic assessment of what experts charge?

11-1025 +++$+++        Thank you, General. Mr. Jaffer. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMEEL JAFFER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Our cases, of course, say, do say "certainly impending," not "substantial risk."       No, let's leave that aside.     You have two arguments; one is likelihood of future injury and the other is present obligations or cause.     I want to focus on the former.     Our standard is certainly impending, and you articulated it by saying, substantial risk.     There is obviously a vast difference between those two.       It's not enough, of course, to know that the government is using the statute.     The whole question is whether or not your clients have been injured, not whether the statute's being used.       I'm sorry, do you want to finish?     If it's all right, could you finish the answer?       Counsel, it seems to me that the concern you're talking about is present in every area of practice.     If you're representing someone who is being prosecuted, you don't send an e-mail saying, you know, the government hasn't yet asked where you threw the gun, and we've got to be prepared to answer questions on that because, as you know, that's a real probable. I mean, you don't send messages like that through the e-mails or just talk casually over the phone either.       Well, the plaintiffs aren't going to be monitored under the statute.     Other people are, and your concern is collateral, that the plaintiffs' discussions might be picked up.     But the plaintiffs are not going to be monitored as targets.       Well, that's why I'm saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the government could come in and say:     We're not going to monitor these people.     Under the statute, you can say that today.     The question is whether or not your clients' conversations can be picked up in an incidental way.       Maybe it's a difference in how we're using the word monitor.     You do know that your Plaintiffs have not been monitored.       What you don't -- well, others have been monitored abroad, right?       You're not monitored in the sense that this is the person's e-mail, and that's what we're going to collect information from, right?       Right.

11-1059 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr.     Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       I'd like to begin with the question of whether or not you waived that argument.       No -- did you waive it or not?       Well, that was not the way the case was presented in the body of the petition, and I would suppose, if that were your objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we might have heard about that, as you -- as you suggest.       And if, in fact, we thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68 offer was not accepted, we might have thought differently about whether to grant it.       You -- you rely on the question presented.     Your reformulated question doesn't have that feature in it.       What -- what benefit does this -- why are you arguing so much?     You -- you will have an entry of judgment in the favor of your client who is, according to you, similarly situated to lots of others. Why don't you just -- if somebody comes forward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for $7500, or whatever it is, you get attorneys' fees, and you can do that as often as you want.       Well, I know.     But that's the fortuity of the fact that she didn't accept the offer.     And we are dealing, perhaps, with a case on the record, as presented to us, where she did accept the offer, if you waive that argument.     So -- so assume the case where the offer is accepted.       It doesn't matter in terms of what the judge is supposed to do with your motion to certify, if nobody else is in the case?     I mean, isn't that one of the factors? I don't know if it's even a sort of good-faith pleading if -- if -- you want certification, but there is no nobody else there.       Thank you, counsel. We'll hear from Mr. Yang now. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT       I'm not sure I understand.     You think there is a live case, not if he doesn't cash it, but I guess, as Justice Breyer was asking, if it's a day late?     You -- you said, well, there was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it -- you know, could be redressed, by telling him what?     Pay him again?     Or --       Well, you would also have what's usually known as no injury.       So you think a court has to go through the whole process of a trial if the check is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry, here's -- you know, whatever the interest is on the check?       I'm sorry.     Could you directly answer my question about --       Yes.       Or the plaintiff says no -- no standing.       And -- and, as we've said, at every stage of the litigation.       So if you're due -- if you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late, he gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't eliminate the past injury?       Certainly.       Thank you, counsel.

I -- I don't understand why that is.

11-1160 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Can the State -- does the State have a procedure where it can give real-time approval?     In other words, this is going on, and the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending us these letters.     State, could you do something to show that you approve this transaction, whether it's a special law or there is some organization, I guess, in some other case, setup, that could give its approval? Is there --       No, I know.     But I guess my point is can the burden of going forward be switched the other way?     And can this hospital authority say -- you know, to the State, we would like some blessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it? So the choices aren't really build your own hospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but ask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to build a new hospital?     Or is it okay if we acquire this one?

The gg provision that you said the government didn't cite -- you mentioned a provision that ended, anyway, with gg.       Is that in your brief?       Is that in the amici's brief?       Is it anywhere that I can find, other than -- I mean, is it in the appendix to any brief?       It's a little bit much to chide the Solicitor General for not citing it when nobody cited it.       Well, subject to arbitrary and capricious review under Chevron?
11-1274 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, but that ignores the point that has been raised, is that this statute does not just apply in the SEC context.     How many cases have you found across the board in the range of those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued?       So it depends really on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular item in some publication.     Maybe if they've got 1,000 people reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and that's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC; it's all these other government areas. It seems to me that it's going to be almost impossible for somebody to prove that the government should have known about something.     And which part of the government?     I mean, it's a big, big government, and particular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense Contractor Board should have known, but does that mean that the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's office should have known? It seems to me that, at least with respect to that aspect, you really are eliminating any real -- it's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well, I've got to establish that this particular government agency should have known about this. You certainly can't sit back and say, well, years has gone by and --       They can't point to a single case?       So you think it's significant if you can't point to a single case?       And the reason -- the reason there's no private action -- right of action is not because the government could seek civil penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a private right of action.       But it didn't -- it didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case, that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later, years later, however long, so long as they were busy doing other things and didn't have a chance to know.       Counsel, you made the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's only the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the discovery rule when other people can.     But it's when it's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the concerns about repose are particularly presented.     You know, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can decide to go after whomever it discovers, however many years after -- whether it's the Social Security recipient that Justice Breyer mentioned or -- or anyone else. So I at least don't find it unusual that it's the sovereign in particular that doesn't get the benefit of whenever you happen to find about it rule.       Would you agree that when we're talking about the interests in repose that the one plaintiff we should be particularly concerned about is the government?       What about the -- what about the Halper case?
11-1285 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wessler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Is this the part -- I might be mixing this up with something else, but is this the part where he says, unfortunately, the courts don't agree with that? (Laughter.)       Counsel, can -- I want to give you an opportunity to respond to the argument that you've waived, the -- the -- your argument based on the distinction between the summary of the plan and the plan. And there are two things that concern me about that, in particular.     The summary of the plan, which you've had all the time, says, on page 1, "This is only a summary.     Complete plan details are contained in a legal plan document.     If there is any difference between the information in the summary and the legal plan, the legal plan" -- "the legal plan document will govern." So when you had the summary, you were on notice that, if there were any difference between it and the plan, the plan would govern.     You received a copy of the plan in June of 2012.     Okay? And as late as August 29th of 2012, two-and-a-half months afterward, you filed a Joint Appendix that didn't -- didn't contain the provision that you say now governs.     So why shouldn't you be held to have waived that? The first time we found out about that was in your red brief that was filed -- June, July, August, September -- three months -- October -- four months after you had the plan. So didn't you waive it?       Which was four months after you had the plan and -- and the plan was lodged with us last week for the first time.       The problem is that the district court interpreted the plan as precluding the claim you're making here.     And your argument that that's not true is based not on the summary of the plan, but on the plan itself.       And what the district court does is it defers to the administrator's interpretation of the plan.     So the district court found that the administrator's interpretation was not arbitrary and capricious. So what your friend is arguing is that, well, you are kind of stuck with the district court interpretation, and you can't, at the last minute, argue that it shouldn't control because of some other document.       Well, no, Cigna didn't tell you that.     The plan -- the summary told you that.     It says, "Complete plan details are in the legal plan.     If there is any difference between the summary and the plan, the plan controls."     So you didn't need Cigna to tell you that.       Sure.

11-1347 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cullen. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN J. CULLEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       One thing -- one thing the Court can do is give him back $94,000.       He has no -- his ability to challenge the propriety of the order that he pay $94,000 is gone?       Well, that's not quite fair to say we -- we haven't decided whether we're going to appeal.     I mean, the -- the stay motion was made immediately upon the determination of the merits by the district court, and the district court said no.     So, I mean, didn't they do everything they could have done to -- to get a stay?       Well, that's out of respect to the district judge, who's just issued a ruling on the merits.     I mean, saying -- you know, we have to consider your -- your ruling, not -- you know, we're taking you up right away.       It seems to me -- and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and then have to be brought back, particularly if you have situations where there can be an expeditious appeal. And I think most appellate courts would appreciate the -- the benefit of that. It seems to me, if you -- if you're correct that the decision is moot, it's not going to be a -- there is going to be a rush to judgment by the individual that wants to take the child away.       So everything turns, under your view, on whether or not the district court gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the mother in this case decides to stay in the United States until the U.S. proceedings are done. The incentives if you prevail are for the custodial or the parent with control over the child to leave immediately.     Even after a motion has been filed -- if a motion for a stay has been filed, that's not a stay.     Get on the first plane out, and then you're home free.     That seems, to me, to be a very unfortunate result.       No, no.     I know, but the point is that the other side says that the decision was wrong.       So there has to be at least a period before somebody can go up to the court of appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the parent with control of the child is trying to find the first flight out, and once she does, it's all over.
11-1351 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Shah? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, the "unequivocally" -- we have a lot of cases that say you don't get -- you certainly get the benefit of the "unequivocally" standard, when you are talking about a waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, but you don't keep getting the benefit over and over again when you are talking about, as in this case, an exception to an exception to an exception.       Well, but that was because, at that point, there was an exception to the exception of sovereign immunity.       And you're going even a step further, to say you get the benefit of the unequivocal test that you've set forth at even the next stage.       No, you've already -- you've already used up your benefit of an unequivocal requirement when you've got the interpretation of the FTCA itself, which is the waiver of sovereign immunity.       Wait a minute.     You agree with me that you don't get the benefit of your higher standard of interpretation with respect to 2680(h)?       But then the -- then the heightened standard of use sort of resurrects again, when you get to considering an exception to 2680(h).       And that was successful.     The Court relied on that argument several times in its opinion.       We certainly -- we certainly cited Smith.       Your friend -- your friend says that, in Smith -- I'm sorry for the confusion -- the Court addressed your argument on the meaning of the Gonzalez Act several times.       So you want us to decide the case with the unequivocal question before us, in other words, deciding whether that benefit to the government applies in this type of case.       It seems to me to be you are really upping the ante here, and it may well -- I have no idea why the government took the opposite position below, but that's -- that's putting a lot more at stake in this case than the particular statutory position.
11-139 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre, is it implicit that you always have a basis? ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Before -- if I could just interrupt you, before you do so, to follow up on Justice Kagan's question. Under our current regime, can you ever give more than a 70 percent chance?     Because you have, in the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling, the IRS can reach a different result and it can do that retroactively.     So, I mean, you don't disagree with that, right?     I mean, if we determine that Colony was ambiguous, the IRS can change the rule in Colony, and it can apply that rule, new rule, retroactively.     That's what our cases say, right?       Thank you, counsel.
11-1425 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shapiro. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN R. SHAPIRO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       What about a breathalyzer, do you need a warrant for that?       I know what Missouri's position is, and I know it's not a breathalyzer test.     But if the logic of your position leads to the requirement of a warrant for breathalyzer, that would be pertinent in analyzing your position.       So does that mean -- the last footnote in the Solicitor General's brief talks about some other methods, including a urine sample.     Not as accurate as blood, but it can help achieve the same result.     One of the things that I think affects the view in this case is it's a pretty scary image of somebody restrained, and -- you know, a representative of the State approaching them with a needle.     But I take it you would say you need a search warrant for a urine sample, too?       Yes.       What about -- what about this device that you just sort of hold in front of that you don't have to blow up the balloon, you just hold it in front of the individual and it measures to some extent blood alcohol content, or at least whether the individual's been drinking?     Surely you don't need a search warrant for that.       You're in an odd -- odd position to be making -- it's an understandable position -- your argument is these warrants are just easy as -- as pie.     You just send in this thing, the judge does it in an instant, it doesn't take very long at all.     It seems to me that that diminishes the protection of the Fourth Amendment to a far -- far greater extent. The idea is that the prosecuting attorney is supposed to spend some time looking at this before submitting it to the judge and the judge is supposed to spend some time examining it.     But the idea that you're going to do these things in a half hour seems unreasonable to me.       Well, I'm sorry, what's the relevance of that?       But it depends upon when the last -- if a person left the restaurant right after they had a nightcap and then left, but if they just had drinks before, I mean, the problem seems to be there in either case.       You don't know when the person's last drink was.
11-1447 +++$+++        Mr. Wolfson? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Does it make any difference, in his refusing to do anything more, whether the condition is onsite or offsite?       Those are all State -- State law provisions you are talking about.       What about is there -- is there anything in the Federal Constitution that limits the conditions that you can demand?       But that's -- but there is no -- there is no restraint on the agency.     It can ask for the moon -- before it will give a permit?       Do you know of any case where the government has lost a Penn Central case?       Let me present -- I'm sorry.       It doesn't happen very often.       Just -- just to nail it down, your -- your position is that there is no limit in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit?       But -- but the Takings -- the Takings Clause does not.       Sure it would have been -- sure it would have been, if they just went along -- to a landowner, and the landowner is there, minding his own business, and they say, well, you own some property, so give us a 1 million dollars to build a football stadium. That would be -- that would be unconstitutional, right?       One of the things the -- the Federal provision, the Takings Clause, is designed to prevent property owners from having to bear the costs that should be borne by the people as a whole. The football stadium example, there is no reason that a particular landowner should have to pay for the football stadium, simply because he owns property. The Takings Clause is designed to make sure that those exactions are not imposed on property owners, but spread more evenly across the citizens who benefit from it.     And I guess I don't understand why you say that the Takings Clause is the one provision that doesn't apply in that type of situation.       The generally applicable regulation in the football stadium hypothetical is not generally applicable.     It says, you are the owner of this property, and if you want to develop it, you've got to build a football stadium.       I think that your point goes to the question that has been raised about -- there's no permit issued.     He didn't accept the -- the permit.     And I don't understand that proposition. Are you saying that, if you are confronted with an unconstitutional condition, you have to accept it, and then you can challenge it?     You can't simply say you denied that on the basis of an unconstitutional condition, and that's wrong?       Okay.     I'm trying to get to the Federal.     You often fall back to the State provisions.     I'm looking at the Federal Constitution. And, assuming the State provisions give you no relief, is it your position that he has no claim, unless he accepts a permit with unconstitutional conditions?       Thank you, Mr. Wolfson. Mr. Kneedler? ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT       Well, what about -- what about the football stadium?     Do they -- can you pick a particular landowner?     I mean, you took a case in which there is no question, under Nollan and Dolan, about the relationship, proportionality, and nexus. Let's put those to one side because the issue is whether Nollan and Dolan apply.     Can the government say, okay, you want a permit, we will give you the permit, if you fund the new football stadium?       But the one constitutional provision that is concerned with protecting property owners from having to bear burdens that should be borne by the public at large is not applicable?       Do you agree -- your friend on the other side cited a number of places in the record, where he thought your condition was satisfied, that the denial of the permit was expressly based on the failure to comply with the offered conditions.
11-1450 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       And you -- I assume you agree that if at the adequacy hearing, if there ever is one, and it's demonstrated that well, in fact, the amount in controversy is $10 million, then you would be obviously not an adequate representative.       What if you had a case where a lawyer brings an action in Miller County and says, I represent -- I want to represent the class of people with these claims and these claims, whose names begin with A to K.     It turns out that's $4 million. Then, in the next county, at the same time, he files a case saying, I'd like to represent these people whose names begin L to Z.     In each of those cases, it's $4 million.     I take it you don't have any objection to that?       But is a counsel who proceeds on that basis, is there any reason to question his adequacy, let's say he's fully representing, bringing all the claims and all the damages.     He's just decided to break it up from A to K.     Somebody from L is not going to say, well, he's inadequate when he's representing him just because he could have represented everybody in the other action.       Counsel, you realize, of course, you are on pretty thin ice.     You are talking about a Senate Report and now you are talking about proposals that weren't enacted.     Your -- your friend on the other side focuses on the statutory language which tells you how to find out how much is at stake.       Another thing he might be worried about is that if this action is allowed to proceed, although on its face it's worth $4 million, they're going to have to make a determination whether to settle for a particular amount or not. And if they make a determination that they've got to settle for whatever it is, 20 -- you know, $20 per class member, that is going to set the limit for other classes, including the class members who opt out of this action, the class members from Missouri. And the point is that, for a variety of reasons, that this gives extraordinary leverage to the individual class representative of a sort that -- precisely the sort that Congress was worried about.       It's going to be worth a lot more because, if you go to trial, you're going to have a judgment that they should have been giving the general contractor whatever --       -- pickup it is in every case.     And so that is going to be extremely valuable.     It's going to be worth a lot more -- but the downside, it's going to be a lot more than $5 million.       It's very difficult -- one reason, it's very difficult to speculate about Congress, what they speculate about what they would have intended.     Presumably, they may not have thought about the idea that there will be class actions worth a lot more than $5 million, but the plaintiff's lawyer will only ask for less than $5 million.       Why did you decide to file in Miller County?
11-1518 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bensinger? ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILL D. BENSINGER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So if he made nothing on the deal, and it just turns out he got whatever the -- the trust was getting under its interest rate and gave it back, there'd be no defalcation because there'd be no loss in the sense of a lost opportunity?       I'm sorry.     I understood your answer to Justice Kagan to be that you -- there must be a loss, right?       Right.     Does there have to be a loss for there to be a defalcation?       So taking the money out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity.       But there is still a loss.     I mean, when you're investing obviously the return is part of it, but also the question is what risk you assume.     And the trust would have suffered because during that period they were incurring a greater risk. That's one reason you set up a trust, so you don't - you protect people from that risk.       Mr. Gannon? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
11-1545 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, that's right, but your argument it seems, to me, can't be -- let's say you have a general statute, and you've got a provision at the beginning that says this is -- authority to interpret this is delegated to the agency. And you go along, but then, all of a sudden, in -- you know, Section 123, it says it doesn't get any deference interpreting this provision.     Now, you would not say that the first general one controls the specific withdrawal of deference, would you?       No.     You would say you don't get deference on 123.     And, as I understand the case -- and that's why I persist in thinking there's no great disagreement here, your friend on the other side is saying that, particularly given 7(a) and some other things, you should read 7(b)(2) as if Congress had said, Agency, you don't get any deference here. You can read it that way, they say, because 7(a) says nothing shall limit what the State can do, other than what's here in the statute.     And, if you let the FCC -- if you give them deference, you're letting something else limit what the State can do. So why -- and then you dispute, it seems to me, just whether that you should call that jurisdiction or not because people think of jurisdiction as meaning, oh, you don't get through the door.     But, if what they mean by jurisdiction is simply that the agency gets no deference on this point, then it seems to me everybody's saying the same thing.       Ambiguity in the provision that says, Agency, you get no deference?     Or ambiguity in the substantive provision at issue?       Well, but, if there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right?       Okay.       Right.     Well --       Your friend on the other side has another set of arguments about why you should treat this particular provision differently, and that is because it concerns the authority, or lack thereof, of State and local government agencies. Now, does that play any role at all in your analysis.       We are not -- you know, obviously, the dividing line between State authority and Federal authority is a more significant one than some of the other questions as to which agencies get deference, which is whether rates are reasonable or not reasonable.     And this provision is written in terms of a preservation of State authority. And your view would give the Federal agency deference under Chevron -- very considerable deference in defining when there should be Federal authority and when there should be State.     Is that, at all, a pertinent consideration?       Normal -- I'm sorry I interrupt you, but the normal rules of statutory construction include a clear statement rule?       Who has to -- who has to be clear on their statement?     Which way?       That it intended to intrude upon State authority?       No, it wasn't going to be that.     That -- the idea that there is no difference between the Federal judiciary defining the limits between the State and Federal power and having an agency of unelected bureaucrats responsible to the executive saying when the State controls and when the Federal controls, those are vastly different propositions.       Yes.       But they have also said -- they have also said, in (7)(a), that those are the only limits, not add on to this any limits that unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will give them -- and the courts must give them vast deference in enforcing those limits.       I'm sorry.     Is it AT&T v. --       Okay.       But, in rejecting that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of that opinion in nowhere, in no place, applied Chevron deference in answering that question. It was entirely de novo, unlike in Section , when it was finally decided, okay, we've got the answer here, and, now, we will defer to the agency on the substance of the determination.       Does it cite --       -- in Part 2, which is --       -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 pages of analysis of the Chevron case?       Does it say they are applying Chevron deference?       Okay.       You're talking about       Okay.     What is there about (7)(A) that you think is ambiguous?       Well, but, I mean, your argument there is basically saying, when the statute says something is reasonable, it means that the Commission doesn't have -- it's a jurisdictional question whether it's reasonable or unreasonable. But it seems to me that this provision is quite a bit different.     It talks about the authority of a State.     And, usually, when we are talking about the authority of which entity can -- can govern, we view that as jurisdictional. There may well be cases at the margin that are -- that are difficult.     But -- but your argument is, basically, reasonable or unreasonable is the same as State or Federal.       No, no.     I'm not talking about the federalism values.     I'm talking about your argument that, oh, once you say you can draw a jurisdictional line here, people will argue you can draw it everywhere.       Yes, that's exactly right.     That limits it.     And -- and the question then is, of course, whether that's enforced in court -- enforced in court or before the agency; right?       Well, whether the -- whether the standard is defined in -- by -- through direct judicial review or by the agency, with deference to the agency.       Thank you, General. Mr. Goldstein, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       What if --       What if the children -- well, I don't want -- the Capato twins were conceived years after of the death in this case?     Would your argument be the same?       Why is that?     Why would they all involve children born relatively soon after?       Well, there's no reason it couldn't take place 4 years after.       So, what happens if the biological mother remarries or something and then goes through this process?     Does the child get double survivor benefits or --       Which -- I assume you would argue that in that case the child is eligible through two different routes.       Counsel, under Chevron, you lose if the statute is ambiguous.     Is there any reason we shouldn't conclude based on the last hour that it's at least ambiguous? (Laughter.)       Thank you, counsel.
11-161 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Stancil. Mr. Clement. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, that's simply because, as we said in Allegheny Pittsburgh, the basis for considering the equal protection claim is the rights that you're given under State law.     In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it says you have the right to be treated equally with respect to assessments.     And you weren't. Here the law says you have the right to be treated equally, or whatever it is, the apportionment, and they weren't.     All that you're saying there is that State law gets to set the base.     And if the State law says we don't treat people the same in extending sewer hook-ups, then that takes away your Equal Protection Clause.     But it just sets the base.       The change in policy -       The change in policy is from treating people equally to treating people unequally.     I don't see how the fact that they're changing that policy addresses the issue at all. They're going from a system where everybody was subject to the same assessment to a system where some pay something and other people pay 30 times that.     Yes, it's a change, but it's the change that presents the problem.       And the city retains that option in this case going forward.     The problem with -       -- your analogy is you're dealing with a situation -- you're saying, well, here's a violation and the law can -- and what does the law do?     But this -- this is exactly 180 degrees away. There's no violation, and the law creates the violation. In that situation -       -- I think you're dealing with an entirely different case.       Well, I think I don't see the answer -       Excuse me.     I don't see the answer to Justice Scalia's question.     You're saying this would be a rational system going forward, but you also promised the people that they would be treated equally over a certain period. When you start out it's not equal because somebody pays $400 and somebody else pays 10,000, and - but over the 30-year period, it's the same.     That's why it's equal in the beginning, even though somebody pays and somebody pays 10,000 because they're going to pay the same over the period. Then you lop off the period.     So, you're not treating them equally.     Go -- when you started.     You can no longer say don't worry about the inequality; it will sort out in 30 years.     Now you can't -- you have no way of telling them why it's not unequal.       Well, there is a provision -- you said I'd search in vain for this provision in the Barrett Law.       -- 15(b)(3)says, "The costs shall be primarily apportioned equally among all abutting lands or lots."       It says "costs."       Where -- where do I look to find that when they say the costs shall be apportioned equally, they are not referring to the costs, but they were referring to the assessments?       The costs of the project are funded by the -- the sewer hook-ups, and some people pay 400 and some people paY 10,000.       You just said it's not popularity.     In page 1 of your brief, you say, "The Barrett Law method eventually proved to be politically unpopular."     Sounds like it's popularity to me.       But that -- if I could -- you mentioned Heckler v. Mathews.     In Heckler v. Mathews, the Court said, quote:     "Ordinarily, extension" -- of the withheld benefit -- "rather than nullification is the proper course."       So, while it is true that you can cure a violation by leveling up or leveling down, ordinarily, extension of the benefit is the proper course.     And that's for the reason Justice Scalia gave, because, otherwise, there would be no equal protection case brought.       Well, what -- what did the Court mean when they said, ordinarily, extension is the proper course?       When you say "the other case," you mean every other project?     Because that's -- that's, what, a class action; right?       Well, if everybody -- if everybody entitled to a refund came forward, it would cost you $2.7 million.     And it -       Okay.     Three - $3 million.     And you say the real problem is the huge administrative cost in trying to figure out who you owe it to.     If it's that huge, all they do is somebody who comes forward, asks for a refund, verify that they're - you know, were a homeowner on the project, give them the refund.       The most it's going to cost is $3 million.       Amnesty -- I don't get -- amnesty is entirely different.     Amnesty is for people who did something wrong.     Nobody did something wrong here; it wasn't wrong to pay with installments.       So the amnesty cases don't apply.

MAYNARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Or -- or he is entitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his claims.     You really do just kind of elide the fact that the statute says, "or."       Your -- your friend on the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address different ways of protecting the secured creditor.     (ii) is procedural, right?     You can go through these procedures, and you can cram down, so long as you are going through these procedures, which include credit bidding. Or you can cram down if you ensure that he receives the indubitable equivalent, a substantive protection.     What is wrong with that reading?       Well, but there is, of course, a good reason, which is consistent with the policy of the Bankruptcy Code, which is you do want to look out for the other creditors as well.     And if the secured creditor is getting, indubitably, the value of this security, why don't you weigh in the balance at least the interests of -- of the other creditors?       Well, maybe in this particular case, but that's not going to be true in every case, and we are asked to issue a ruling that is going to apply in every case.      Well, I know, but the whole premise of why this problem arises is that the security is worth a lot less than -- than it was, obviously, when it was -- was purchased.    Or a lot less than -- a lot less than the claim that it was meant to secure.       How does it -- how does it work in practice?     Is this something that is subject of extensive negotiation?     The secured creditor says, well, I'm interested in bidding in a credit bid, but I appreciate that that's going to make it difficult for you to get cash. And you've got these unsecured creditors who would want -- and so, what?     I'm not going to credit bid, so long as -- or I will only credit bid up to this particular amount; or let's sit down and work out a deal, negotiate over exactly how we're going to handle my security.     Is -- is that really how it happens?     Or is that not -- or not.       You said, earlier, we have never said that the specific has to be a subset of the general.     How do -- how would it otherwise be specific and the one general?     It seems, if they are not a subset, then they are alternatives.     I don't see how the whole doctrine makes any sense, if the specific is not a subset of the general.       So when we say, our doctrine says the specific controls over the general, the specific is a subset of the general?       Thank you.       Ms. Harrington? ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT       You have got a whole cadre of U.S. trustees that, presumably, can look out for the interests of the poor United States.

Well, but, of course, it could bid up if it thinks that there are going to be other bidders, right?     It has a lot more flexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent of its security interest.

11-182 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Before you get into what the case is about, I'd like to clear up at the outset what it's not about.     No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?     I saw none of that in your brief.       Okay.     So this is not a case about ethnic profiling.       That's a question of enforcement priorities. Well, let's say that the government had a different set of enforcement priorities, and their objective was to protect, to the maximum extent possible, the borders.     And so anyone who is here illegally, they want to know about, and they want to do something about, in other words, different than the current policy. Does that mean, in that situation, the Arizona law would not be preempted?       Well, but you say that the Federal government has to have control over who to prosecute, but I don't see how Section 2(B) says anything about that at all.     All it does is notify the Federal government, here's someone who is here illegally, here's someone who is removable.     The discretion to prosecute for Federal immigration offenses rests entirely with the Attorney General.       Right.     So, apart from Section 3 and Section 5, take those off the table, you have no objection to Section 2?       Exactly.     You -- the Federal government has to decide where it's going to use its resources. And what the state is saying, here are people who are here in violation of Federal law, you make the decision.     And if your decision is you don't want to prosecute those people, fine, that's entirely up to you.     That's why I don't see the problem with Section 2(B).       Only under Section 3 and Section 5.       Let's say you're worried about --       Right. Right. For the notification, what could possibly be wrong, if Arizona arrests someone, let's say for drunk driving, and their policy is you're going to stay in jail overnight, no matter what, okay?     What's wrong, during that period, by having the Arizona arresting officer say, I'm going to call the Federal agency and find out if this person is here illegally because the Federal law says the Federal agency has to answer my question. It seems an odd argument to say the Federal agency has to answer the state's question, but the state can't ask it.       You think there are individual cases in which the state can call the Federal government and say, is this person here illegally?       Okay.     So doesn't that defeat the facial challenge to the Act?       It is --       It is not an effort to enforce Federal law.     It is an effort to let you know about violations of Federal law.     Whether or not to enforce them is still entirely up to you.     If you don't want to do this, you just tell the person at LESC -- if that's the right -- is that the right acronym?       -- LESC, look, when somebody from Arizona calls, answer their question, and don't even bother to write it down.     Okay?     I stopped somebody else, is he legal or illegal, let me check -- it's -- oh, he's illegal.     Okay.     Thanks.     Good-bye. I mean, why -- it is still your decision. And, if you don't want to know who is in this country illegally, you don't have to.       Under 2(B), the person is already stopped for some other reason.     He's stopped for going 60 in a 20.     He's stopped for drunk driving.     So that decision to stop the individual has nothing to do with immigration law at all.     All that has to do with immigration law is the -- whether or not they can ask the Federal government to find out if this person is illegal or not and then leave it up to you. It seems to me that the Federal government just doesn't want to know who is here illegally or not.       That's a pretty good one.       General, you have been trying valiantly to get us to focus on Section 3, so maybe we should let you do that now.       No, keep going.       I had a little -- wasn't sure about your answer to Justice Kennedy. Is the reason that the government is not focused on people who are here illegally, as opposed to the other categories you were talking about, because of prioritization or because of lack of resources? You suggested that if the -- every illegal alien that you identify is either removed or prosecuted, that that would cause tensions with other governments. So I -- I don't understand if it's because you don't have enough resources or because you don't want to prosecute the people who are simply here illegally, as opposed to something else.       And your concern is the problems that would arise in bilateral relations if you remove all of these people -- or a significant percentage or a greater percentage than you are now. Nothing in the law requires you to do that. All it does is lets you know where -- that an illegal alien has been arrested, and you can decide, we are not going to initiate removal proceedings against that individual.     It doesn't require you to remove one more person than you would like to remove under your priorities.       And that -- and that arises under 3 and 5?       But not 2?       Section 5.       Thank you, General.
11-184 +++$+++        Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Harrington. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER       Now, does that mean that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is thrown out on a procedural ground.       Why is that?     I mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural objections all the time and we think of those as judicially reviewable.     It's -- it's a real stretch to say simply because it says "judicially reviewable" it means judicially reviewable on the merits.       Could you say that again?       A little more slowly.       Okay.     It's subject to judicial review.       Now, the next -       Okay.     So I thought that your argument in the brief reduced to the question that an action subject to judicial review in one section is not judicially reviewable in another.     That's right?       I thought -- I thought I heard you to say, and this is what I understood your brief to say, that an action that is subject to judicial review is not judicially reviewable under 7703(b)(2).       Okay.       It's a tough argument.       Counsel, getting back to judicially reviewable -       -- even if I accept your argument that that's not the same as subject to judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get to your position? This is not something about -- a provision about what's judicially reviewable and what's not.     It's a notice provision.     It says these actions have to be filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review.       And then you say that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence about notice.      Well, yes, that's where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way to establish that that is the critical element that tells you which provisions you can take forward when it just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of judicial review.       And here the Government says, aha, judicial review, we think that does not mean subject to judicial review.    Judicially reviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review.      Yes.       As of.     See, it shall be reviewable action as of.     Again, it's just going to the timeliness.
11-192 +++$+++        Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Jacobs. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. JACOBS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       I'm sorry.     Before you get --       But if you -- their argument is if you go to the Seventh Circuit, you don't get any money, right?     Because if you're getting money from the United States, don't you have to go to the Court of Claims in a case like this?       No?       But your argument -- your answer is a little more complicated, because the statute doesn't say tort claims, it says claims sounding in tort, which means cases that aren't torts, but are like torts.     And it seems to me the case you -- you -- you have here is like tort, an invasion of privacy or something like that.       Well, your friend says that that's a fiduciary -- that's a trust breach, which has been regarded as different than a tort.       Now, it does seem -- I mean, Justice Breyer's point.     It does seem a little ad hoc.     In other words, they don't fit quite together, and your answer is:     Well, we'll just take whatever, you know, whatever we have to, to make it fit.     It would go under the least imposing on the Government. It suggests that Congress did not expect the Tucker Act to apply if you've got to change the remedial provisions in FCRA to get it to fit under the Tucker Act.       You can finish your sentence.       Thank you, Counsel.       Mr. Srinivasan, you have three minutes left. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
11-199 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Brindley. Mr. Yang. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       You're going over the evidence.     And I may simply be asking the same question Justice Kennedy asked earlier.     But let's say you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence has the defendant saying:     I'm guilty, I'm guilty.     And the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what, you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting. And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes:     You know, the guy said he was guilty. Is that a situation in which we're supposed to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence, and see if a jury would have convicted?     Or can we with a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what led the jury to convict?       Counsel, when you began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were two ways in which your position was different from Mr. Brindley's.       One I understand is that you look at a rational jury --       -- and not the particular jury. What's the second?       Briefly.

Your long list sort of stopped one step short.     They don't make sales.       Is there -- let's say the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says, okay, yours is the first thing I'll think of, you know, when I have a patient with this and this.     I mean, is that a sale?       So, what if the doctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to this guy, and they say, okay, I'll think of -- you know, when it comes up, I'll think of your product; and the next guy comes in from the other company, and he says, okay, when it comes up I'll think of your product -- are those two sales or no sale?       But that's a firmer commitment when they say I'll buy it.     The physician is just saying I'll think of your product when it -- when the need comes up.       Certainly.       Thank you, counsel.
11-210 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Libby. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. LIBBY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       What is -- what is the First Amendment value in a lie, a pure lie?       The value of what?       What does that mean?       No, not exaggerate -- lie.       Well, but that was for literary purposes.     No one is suggesting you can't write a book or tell a story about somebody who earned a Medal of Honor, and it's a fictional character; so, he obviously didn't.     It just seems to me very different.       That's not a statement about one's self.     This is -       It seems to me that the Stolen Valor Act is more narrow than that.     And I would say, in that situation, you would not describe what the individual in Justice Breyer's hypothetical was as simply telling a -- a false statement about himself. It is about whether there is someone hiding in the attic.     It is not about himself.       In order to -       It seems to me that that's missing the limitation that the Government has read into this statute:     Not damage, not for parody, not to avoid the discovery of someone who should be hidden, not in order to do something with respect to one's grandson.     It's just a purely false statement about oneself.     What -- what -- what is the First Amendment value in that, again?       Well, of course, they do in countless areas, the state does, whether you're talking about defamation, trademark, perjury, all sorts of things.     You can't adopt that as a general principle and apply it without regard to the situation.       I don't understand the Government to argue that the speech at issue here is totally unprotected.     I understand them to argue -- I mean, is -- it's totally unprotected.     I understand them to argue that it can be limited under its "breathing space" rationale.     In other words, it's not within one of the categories of totally unprotected speech.     You do have to analyze it under the First Amendment, and you analyze it to determine if it chills protected speech.       Well, not under your theory, right?     I mean, it -- I mean, it's still a sanction for telling something that you say is protected under the First Amendment, whether you get 6 months or a medal of shame doesn't matter under your theory.       How do we -- how do we know that?     He was politically active, right?       He was involved - well, doesn't it help a politician to have a congressional Medal of Honor?       But it seems to me that your willingness to say that this statute is valid so long as there's some benefit to the person who lies, it's an awfully big concession.       So, if he -- so, if he makes this statement at a debate when he's running for office, then you can prosecute him because getting the office is presumably something of value.     It presumably has some pecuniary aspect to it.       Thank you, Mr. Libby. General Verrilli, you have 3 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11-262 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lane. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, what you've described is not when the person was arrested, right?       The person was arrested later, when approached by the Secret Service agent, lied about whether he touched the Vice President; at that time, in a non-protected area, was carrying a bag, right?       To arrest the person?       The reason it's multifaceted is because I'm trying to capture what might have been going through the Secret Service agent's mind at the time.       Well, what would be going in a reasonable Secret Service's agent's mind at the time.       So, what you have, under your theory, a person should put on his car a bumper sticker that says "I hate the police" and then every time they're pulled over, they will have -- certainly a plausible case is you violated my First Amendment rights.     It's not because I was going 60 miles an hour; it's because of my bumper sticker.       And the police officer -- at that point, he says, you know, I can't give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into court on personal liability because he's got a credible case that it was for First Amendment grounds.       No, no.     You've already got the officer in court.     I mean, you get a speeding ticket, and most times they don't show up because they have got other things to do.     Now he's got to show up in district court, in State court, to defend against this.       Right.     Well, this --       Is that -- is that a case that you could state?       He pulled me over, he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying "I hate the police."       Does that go to trial?       Why doesn't it go to trial?     And -- well, does it go -- I mean, do you get depose the police officer?     You know, why did you stop him?     Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles an hour that day?       So, the only way you can find out is you put in the evidence -- here's the bumper sticker -- and you put the police officer on the stand --       -- and you say, why did you do it?       And then all of a sudden -- I don't know why everybody doesn't have a bumper sticker.       But they didn't arrest him -- they didn't arrest until after he lied, right?       Well, summary judgment, that's -- you've already been in court for a long time when you're talking about summary judgment.       Well, there is an easy way out of it.     We could agree with the -- (Laughter.)       One thing about your analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a very black-and-white view of what's going on in the officer's mind:     Did you stop -- did you arrest him because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate security? And I suspect that the people engaged in this type of thing have intuition.     I mean, they don't sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's wandering around, looks like he's looking for something, with a -- with a bag?     I mean, I assume they sort have experience and they calculate all this in and say I've got to do something.     And how do you parse those different motivations?       One reason that I, in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice President, the lying about it, the wandering around with the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation to protect the Vice President.

Well, the case is not -       I was just going to say the case is not going to be over if we dismiss.       Because, as you just said, it's interlocutory.       I thought -- I thought -- I'm sorry.     I thought they said that their rules mooted this case.       Well, if we -- if we dismiss as improvidently granted, are you suggesting that the Ninth Circuit would then be the -- be a court to consider this?       I'm -- I'm just thinking if we vacate, perhaps another court will consider it, but if we dismiss as improvidently granted, the Ninth Circuit will, quite reasonably, think they are done.       Well, I mean, they're done -- they are done in terms of their interpretation of the regulation and the applicable law.       Well, I think the - the Ninth Circuit had the -- of course, EPA's views before it.     I don't know, if I'm the Ninth Circuit, why I would reconsider my ruling, in light of this new regulation.

11-345 +++$+++        Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Counsel, before -- I need to figure out exactly what these numbers mean. Should someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the Hispanic box or some different box?       Well, I suppose a person who is one-quarter percent Hispanic, his own determination, would be, I'm one-quarter percent Hispanic.       They would check that box.     What about one-eighth?       Would it violate the honor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and says, I identify as Hispanic, to check the Hispanic box?       You don't check, in any way, the racial identification?       So how do you know you have 15 percent African American -- Hispanic or 15 percent minority?       You say it's "the same way."     What is that way?       There are student lists in each classroom that -- that have race identified with the students?       Oh, you go back to what they checked on the form?       That's a yes or no question.     You go back to what they checked on their application form in deciding whether Economics 201 has a sufficient number of African Americans or Hispanics?       What is that number? What is the critical mass of African Americans and Hispanics at the university that you are working toward?       So how are we supposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored to that goal?       Counsel --       I understand my job, under our precedents, to determine if your use of race is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest.     The compelling interest you identify is attaining a critical mass of minority students at the University of Texas, but you won't tell me what the critical mass is.     How am I supposed to do the job that our precedents say I should do?       I know what you say, but when will we know that you've reached a critical mass?       Grutter said there has to be a logical end point to your use of race.     What is the logical end point?     When will I know that you've reached a critical mass?       So you, what, you conduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially isolated?       And that's the basis for our Constitutional determination?       Okay.     What are the others?       At what level will it satisfy the critical mass?       Yes, but at what level will it satisfy the requirement of critical mass?       When -- how am I supposed to decide whether you have an environment within particular minorities who don't feel isolated?       So, I say -- when you tell me, that's good enough.       They don't -- they don't monitor, but race is the only one of your holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application, right?       I'm sorry.     The question was whether race is the only one of your holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application.       We will give you a little more time since I'm going to give your friend a little more time.       Just to be clear, are you arguing that she doesn't have standing in an Article III sense?       You address that in your brief in one footnote, right?     We have an obligation to consider it in every case, and what you gave us is one footnote in which you said it's hard to see how she could establish cognizable jurisdiction.       What about -- what about our Jacksonville case that said it is an injury to be forced to be part of a process in which there is race-conscious evaluation?       I thought your friend -- your friend told us that these remedial issues and damages issues had been segregated out of the process and are still available for remand.       Thank you, counsel.       General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       It doesn't function more subtly in every case.     We have findings by both courts below -- and I'm reading from the court of appeals opinion at Petitioner appendix page 33. "The district court found that race is indisputably a meaningful factor that can make a difference in the evaluation of a student's application."     If it doesn't make a difference, then we have a clear case; they're using race in a way that doesn't make a difference.     The supposition has to be that race is a determining factor. We've heard a lot about holistic and all that.     That's fine.     But unless it's a determining factor, in some cases they're using race when it doesn't serve the purpose at all.     That can't be the situation.       You have to agree that it makes a difference in some cases.       Okay.       Just to get back to what we're talking about, you -- as I understand it, race by itself is taken into account, right?     That's the only thing on the cover of the application; they take race into account. And the district court found -- and you're not challenging -- that race makes a difference in some cases, right?       General, how -- what is your view on how we tell whether -- when the University has attained critical mass?       Okay.     I'm hearing a lot about what it's not.     I'd like to know what it is because our responsibility is to decide whether this use of race is narrowly tailored to achieving, under this University's view, critical mass.       Oh, yes.       Sure.
11-393 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       How does your proposal actually work?     Your idea is that, well, they can take care of it themselves later.     I mean, do you contemplate them bringing litigation and saying -- I guess the insurers would be the most obvious ones -- without -- without the mandate, the whole thing falls apart, and we're going to bear a greater cost, and so the rest of the law should be struck down. And that's a whole other line of litigation?       But what cause of action is it?     I've never heard of a severability cause of action.       Before you go, Mr. Kneedler, I'd like your answer to Justice Breyer's question. chance -- I think you were interrupted --       -- before you had a       Justice Kennedy.       Well, how is that -- what's exactly right?     It's a question of statutory interpretation.     That means you have to go through every line of the statute.     I haven't heard your answer to Justice Scalia's question yet.       How do you know that?     Where is this line?     I looked through the whole Act.     I didn't read -- well --       Where is the sharp line?       No, no.     That --       That makes your case that the one provision should fall if the other does. It doesn't tell us anything about all the other provisions.       Well --       But what if there isn't Medicaid expansion?     We've talked about the individual mandate, but does the Government have a position on what should happen if the Medicaid expansion is struck down?       So, it -- the Government's position is that if Medicaid expansion is struck down, the rest of the Act can operate --       -- without it.       All of that was based on the assumption that the mandate was constitutional.     And if -- that certainly doesn't stop us from reaching our own determination on that.       Well, that's right. But the problem is, straight from the title, we have two complementary purposes, patient protection and affordable care.     And you can't look at something and say this promotes affordable care; therefore, it's consistent with Congress's intent.     Because Congress had a balanced intent.     You can't look at another provision and say this promotes patient protection without asking if it's affordable. So, it seems to me if you ask what is going to promote Congress's purpose, that's just an inquiry that you can't carry out.       Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Farr. ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III, AS THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE       You -- you're referring to the Government's second position.     Their first, of course, is that we shouldn't address this issue at all.       I asked Mr. Kneedler about what procedure or process would be anticipated for people who are affected by the change in -- in the law and the change in the economic consequences.     Do you have a view on how that could be played out?     It does seem to me that if we accept your position, something -- there have to -- there has to be a broad range of consequences, whether it's additional legislation, additional litigation. Any thoughts on how that's going to play out?       But if the challenge is what we're questioning today, whether -- if you're an insurance company and you don't believe that you can give the coverage in the way Congress mandated it without the individual mandate, what -- what type of action do you bring in court?       Certainly.       Thank you, Mr. Farr. Mr. Clement, you have 4 minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
11-45 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Could I ask you to pause --       -- briefly on that question?     So, the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes in before the MSPB and says we have three witnesses who are going to testify only on the constitutional issue; I have this volume of evidence about what's happening in the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to present this -- the government is going to say it's okay with us, right?       They're not going to object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide.       If I could just focus there.     In your brief, you're quite careful, and you have been today, to talk to even if the MSPB lacked this authority.     It's your position that the MSPB does lack this authority in fact; right?     It's not just the MSPB's position.       I mean, the idea of -- the special masters floating around freely every time you get one of these cases -- I mean, what -- inevitably what's going to happen is that you're going to have a more or less permanent special master who gets all these things.     You're not going to appoint 85 special masters if there are 85 of these sorts of claims.     It seems to me you've got an agency there that's expert in the interrelation between the different provisions in the statute.     And, you know, why don't -- why don't -- they make factfindings all the time in areas within their authority to decide.     It seems to me it's ready-made for sending these things back.       What if -- I guess that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it?       I mean, it's pretty odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you couldn't pursue.
11-460 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shah. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE       Doesn't that always say that in the judgment of the Court?       Does it say, "It is so ordered," in the judgment that we release?       The reason it would not look at Malibu and -- what's the other one that we're already --       Yes -- would be because it wouldn't comply with the cross-petition rule.       We're are not going to send it back to them to --       Do -- do you have a position on the cross-petition issue?       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Colangelo. ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON COLANGELO ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, where is the permit's own terms?     Your friend cited JA 93, which says each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator.     So where does the permit clearly show the opposite?       Well --     Looking at , it strikes me as a little bit circular to say  to say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with the permit, and their point is, well, we're not -- we're not not in compliance with the permit because you haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the discharges to them.       Well, I think that might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets back to the question of whether the permit is -- is poorly drafted.       And -- and I guess the idea is they're changing the permit so to -- to cure that problem.       Well, this is all fine and good.     Your -- your friend, though, says you should have cross-petitioned because the relief you seek expands the judgment below, and there are all these cases saying you can't do that.       Well, I understand that, but -- it seems reasonable, but they do cite a lot of cases that say you can't do that.     You can't just sort of say, oh, I give up on the others because the judgment, I guess, is one whole, and you would be changing the judgment.       Where on 4 to 5?       Are the provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been talking about, the three that you cited and the one that youre -- are they boilerplate?     Do they show up in every typical stormwater permit?       Yes.     What about the one that says each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator?
11-465 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hermansen. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KURT D. HERMANSEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, just the way you phrased it, if it addresses the bulk of the claims, under your theory it has to address every claim, correct?       No, no.     Not overlooked or omitted.     Not discussed.       Not analyzed in the opinion.       You agree that if -- if this was raised when your friend was at the lectern -- if the court at the end said, not only denied, but said, I considered all other arguments not addressed, denied, then you have no case, correct?       Well, you're not willing to assume that when the judge says "denied." You're willing to assume that when the judge says:     I've looked at everything, denied.       It seems to me if you give them the presumption of regularity in the one case you ought to give it to them in the other.       Well -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.       No, the --       The discussion you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is that the court is going to have to decide in every case whether or not State law is coterminous with Federal law.     And there was -- I don't know that the Ninth Circuit got that question right in this case or they got it wrong, but in every case, or many of the cases, the claim will be made on the part of the State, well, yes, they just said State law, but it's the same as Federal law.     And the Ninth Circuit recognized that as an exception to their rule.     Isn't that really going to cause all sorts of collateral litigation?       I'm sorry?       Oh, it's not.       Except in a case like Harrington v. Richter.

Thank you.       I think -- I think this may have been asked, and I'm not sure of the -- I understood the answer. This is -- is this on an ongoing, forward-looking basis?     In other words, you enter into the contracts, and then you wait and see whether there are appropriations?       Well, so doesn't it make -- I mean, doesn't the system that the government is operating under make a lot of sense?     Because let's say the tribe says, look, we need a million dollars. The Secretary agrees to it.     And then I assume the two of them get together and say, well, we'll try to get the appropriation for it.     You know, you understand we may not get it, but this is how much you need, we'll go back and get it.     If you get it, that's great.     If you don't, well, then that's --       Are you suggesting that --       Are you suggesting that Congress has to go through each of those contracts and say, this is how much we're going to appropriate, this is how much -       Well, the question is whether it's the staff in Congress that's going to do it or the staff at the Department of the Interior?       And I suppose Congress can reasonably determine that the people at Interior know better about how to do it than we do.
11-556 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Every -- every time -- every time you adopt a rule rather than a multifactor analysis, there are going to be particular cases that fall outside the rule that look like a harsh result.     Now, here it simply affects the nature.     It doesn't give any immunity for harassment, it just affects the nature of the showing that might be made. You have no difficulty, as representing an employer, by saying that in every case an allegation of this sort is made you have to go through a case-by-case description of the particular responsibilities, whether it's the thermostat, whether it's the music, whether it's the assignment of everything -- that the employee does, and decide on that basis whether or not you should compensate the victim, or -- or whether or not you should go to court?       Well, I think -- I think your friend on the other side was -- made a good point in his reply brief, which is the variety of circumstances you think courts should look at just happen to correspond with the factual issues that you would have resolved in your favor.       Thank you, counsel.
11-564 +++$+++        Mr. Blumberg. ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD K. BLUMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       What were the mothballs there for?       Okay, then --       Well, that's my question.     Are we talking about the expectation of privacy in the marijuana or the expectation of privacy in the odor?       Well -- well, no, that can't be right, because if you're letting smoke out that -- that -- I don't know, from the burning of a body or something, you don't say, well, because he's trying to conceal that you can't rely on the smoke.       So I guess the question here is, if you appreciate the fact that the odor is coming out to the extent that you're going to put mothballs all around the house, it seems to me that you -- you may have an expectation of privacy in the marijuana plants, but you don't have an expectation of privacy in the odor, because you're emitting it out, out into the world, and it's the odor that was detected.       That's like saying you put the -- the drugs in a -- in a bag to protect them from observation on the outside, but you use, you know, a clear bag rather than a, you know, opaque one or something.     You didn't -- you weren't very successful. And -- when you began you said assuming that's what the mothballs were there for.     That is what they were there for, isn't it?     There is no other reason --       Well, our Fourth Amendment cases are very clear that they don't turn on the subjective intent of the particular officer.       I thought you just said it depends on whether or not he's going up to the door to sniff or going up for something else.       Yes, sure, if he's down on his knees; but, what if he goes up to the front door and sniffs?     I mean, he's --       -- he's got to breathe.     I mean, how do you tell whether it's different? I don't understand.     He's going up to drop off, you know, tickets to the Policeman's Ball, and he smells marijuana.     What is that?     Is that a violation or not?       So it depends on -- but if he's going up to sniff, it is a violation?       Can odors be in -- in the equivalent of plain sight, plain smell?     In other words, the officer goes up to drop off the Policeman's Ball tickets, the door is open, he sees the dead body. The officer goes up to sell the Policeman's Ball tickets, and he sees -- he smells the marijuana.     Okay in both cases, right?       So this depends upon how strong the odor is.       If the -- let's say it's a townhouse that goes right up to the sidewalk.     If the police go by with their dog intending to sniff, and the dog alerts, on the sidewalk but two feet away is the front door, that's okay, right?       So it's okay?       Well, let me make sure I understand you.     The policeman is walking down the sidewalk with his dog, the dog stops and alerts. That doesn't constitute sufficient probable cause to get a search warrant to go into the townhouse.     There's been no entry onto the property, just a policeman walking with his dog.       Sure.       He's walking the dog.     He's not out searching.     He's walking the K-9 dog, and the dog alerts on a house without any trespass.     You think that's still bad?       What is the constitutionally protected area in this case?       Even though it's the sidewalk where people -- there's an implied license for people to walk up to --       But there is an implied license to walk up to the front door, right?       Maybe this is the same question Justice Alito asked earlier, but people have different senses of smell.     So what if there is some person who has, you know, the best sense of smell in the department, and they say, well, let's use him to go do the knock and talks when we suspect drugs; that way, he may discover the odor of marijuana when other people wouldn't.     Is it -- is it -- is it wrong for them to select the person with the best sense of smell to do that?       To do a knock and talk.     You said knock and talks are okay.       Thank you, counsel.

11-597 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So it's -- there is a little confusion about the Government's position, there was in the court of appeals. Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's brief, and he says:     "The Federal Circuit adopted a categorical rule that temporary Government action can never be a taking if the Government does not intend to create a permanent flooding condition."     Is that an accurate statement of your understanding?       Well, there are pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the question of causation, right?       So, so if the Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream that every March and April we are going to flood your property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for those 2 months, correct?       No?     The Government says you will not be able to use your land because of what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you can't.     That's not a taking?       I'll grant you that it can decide whose land it wants to take.     I just want to know why that's not a taking.       So if the Government says we've got to release the flood waters and what we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and we're going to drive them down river to this person's property and we're going to dump the water there?       But your answer is that would be a taking?       Well, I thought --       Right.       Again, I think the Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary.       They said the Government knew that this water was going to go right here, right?       What if the Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the water has to percolate or whatever down in this area. So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5 million worth of his trees.     The same purpose, to assist in flood control.     No doubt that that's a taking, right?       Okay.       Sure, sure.     And so the Government then comes down and says, we're going to flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the factual findings -- we know that will result in your trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood control, that's just too bad.     Different case when they go in with a chain saw than when they go in with the water?       Right.       Well, just before you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at least for me, is the difference between what the Federal circuit decided and what you're arguing. You seem to be arguing that it doesn't make any difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or permanent, right?     The Federal circuit thought it was dispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not permanent.     So it seems to me that you're fighting, and you're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very exhaustive findings, to present a different argument.       It seems to me that if we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that it doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be something less, then maybe you've preserved all these other arguments or maybe not, but --       I know, but you agree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then you're presenting all these other arguments in which it doesn't depend. So, if we disagree with the Federal circuit, it seems to me that we ought to say that, and maybe you can make these other arguments about it's too far downstream or --       Or upstream, under your theory.       It strikes me that that's a valuation question.     But I understood you to say that if there was a pipe coming out of the dam and it went to somebody's -- right to the property line of somebody's land and that's where you dump the water, that would be a taking.       Okay.     I thought the factual findings in the trial court said that was this case, that you knew when you opened up the dam that this is where the water was going to go.       What about 6 years later, when it was doing the same thing and the water went to the same place?       If there's notice and comment -- so the choice is, there are 10 landowners downstream.     The question is which one you're going to flood.     And you flood number 2, and there is a public process in which number 1 and 3 through 10 get to say, yes, this sounds fine to me. (Laughter.)
11-626 +++$+++        Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Just like an inner tube, right?       Floats, can be towed, can carry a person.       One of those inflatable rafts where most of the parts of the people --       Well, practical capability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're about transportation -- you're talking about things that were built for transportation, right?       Counsel, your example of the towing cleats highlights one of the difficulties I have; one, because obviously the question of, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats, and then what if they had the towing cleats and then took them off, what if they were temporary towing cleats.     One of the things, this is a jurisdictional statute and we like jurisdictional statutes to be clear and easy of application.     Why do you think your test is easier than your friend's test?       It's got -- it doesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most like a boat in my view is a raked bow.     That tells you that that's what they want to use it for, to move through the water.     This is straight up and down.       It doesn't have a -- what are the things called on the side, the elevated sides that you'd look for in a boat.       Well, but, I mean, there is some easy things to visualize as a problem.     If this is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a week is a seaman under the Jones Act, right?       I'm sorry, taken out of navigation, but not every time it's docked, right?
11-681 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   I thought Medicaid had something to do with how much they were reimbursed. You're saying Medicaid is beside the point?   If you hire a homecare provider to provide homecare services, isn't how much the person is compensated -- you have a Medicaid program, a cooperative program with the Federal Government, doesn't it set the rates with which those services are reimbursed?   Well, right, that -- it's a cooperative State/Federal program. But isn't there -- are you saying the wages have nothing to do with how much the -- the Medicaid reimbursement for these types of services?   But they don't just give you a bunch of money and say, Well, here it is, you figure out how much you want to -- I mean, I thought this case had something to do with the fact that Medicaid was used to reimburse these employees, and you're saying it has nothing to do with that at all?   I just want to know -- not what their challenge is. I want to know where the money comes from. It comes from Medicaid, and I assume Medicaid sets some parameters about how much you can reimburse homecare providers.   So you can negotiate whatever rates you want with the homecare providers, regardless of what Medicaid says about those services?   Yes, yes.   One thing, Mr. Smith, the first word in your brief is "Medicaid." I don't understand because the argument can be made that Medicaid reimbursement rates is an important public policy issue, not simply a labor issue. Now, let's say you have a teachers' union, okay? They think it's a very important public issue. They have a platform. They engage in activities to get higher Medicaid reimbursement rates. Is that something that a nonunion member would have to pay for, or would they -- would that expense be segregated out of what they must pay?   Teacher -- teacher union, okay?   They have a political position on Medicaid rates. They spend money to advance that position. If you're a teacher, but you're not a member of the union, do you have to pay for that expenditure?   Right. Same -- same public -- same expenses for Medicaid --   -- but you're a homecare provider. Your union spends to get higher Medicaid rates. You're not a member of the union. Do you have to pay for their political activity to raise Medicaid rates?   So one -- I'm sorry. If I could just finish the thought. So the same speech with respect to one union is a speech on a matter of public concern, but with respect to another union, it's not?   Okay. So it's Medicaid. Now, is that part of the chargeable expenses or not? This union wants to talk about Medicaid reimbursement rates. Can a nonunion member be compelled to share that expense?   I mean Medicaid reimbursement rates. That's what I mean by Medicaid reimbursement rates.   So in this case in this case, if this union negotiates over Medicaid reimbursement rates, it is chargeable.   Even though, what I understood your answer to be, is that Medicaid reimbursement rates had nothing to do with this case.   And that includes Medicaid reimbursement rates.   Thank you, counsel. General. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS   General Verrilli, does Medicaid have anything to do with this case?   Right, right.   Right. Your statement of interest -- your statement of interest explaining why you are here today discusses the effect of the Medicaid program.   If the -- if the union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State because they would get a higher wage or could get a higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is that within the -- their functioning as a union rather than a political group?   Oh, so if the union wants to say, Look, the only way our people are going to get higher wages is if there's a higher Medicaid reimbursement rate for this service, that is not within the scope of collective bargaining?   Please finish your thought.   Thank you, General. Mr. Messenger, you have four minutes remaining. REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

You have to start with the difficulty of the language here, and then you have to proceed and put the Quality King gloss over it; and, when you finally get to that point, you say, well, now you've got to read Bobbs-Merrill and figure out how the common law governs all that.       Well, it's not that complicated under the Petitioner's approach.     It says once you've you had a first sale, that's it.

I don't -- you just made the argument that your position on Castro-Rodriguez is wrong.     You say Congress took away the Attorney General's discretion. Then you come back and say, well, we're going to exercise that discretion under -- under Castro-Rodriguez, and this Petitioner in particular can take advantage of it.       Is that -- is the authority for that Castro-Rodriguez?       Is the authority for that the decision in Castro-Rodriguez?       Right.       This is --       Go ahead.     I'm sorry.       But this is -- this is a new position for the government.     My understanding is that you -- your clients were on the other side of this position in Castro-Rodriguez itself; is that not correct?       But that was a change in the government's position, wasn't it?       So what does -- in a case in which the Attorney General can cancel removal, putting aside this case, what are the sort of things he looks at in deciding whether or not to cancel removal?       So one of the things, presumably, is the amount of drugs involved, whether they were for intent to distribute for remuneration -- all the sorts of things that you say he can consider under the provision that says he does not have the authority to cancel removal.       And the whole point -- the whole point is that there is no similar provision in the statute at issue in this case, right?       Does that -- does the Castro-Rodriguez proceeding take care of those additional consequences?       Sure.     Oh, yes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE IN PART AND VACATUR IN PART       Well, that's exactly right, but you see it only on one side of the problem. You say, well, you can't treat it as if it's been precleared --       -- because that would be prejudging what the court in D.C. is going to do.     But you have no trouble with them saying -- assuming that there are going to be these section 5 violations and drawing additional majority-minority districts, which is just assuming on the other -- the other way what the court here in D.C. is going to do.       I don't know how you -- you lean one way and say, well, it's horrible, you can't use it because it hasn't been precleared; but it's all right in drawing the interim plan to treat it as there -- as if preclearance has been denied.       And if you look -- and if you look at Joint Appendix 146 --       -- to 147, it looks the exact opposite.     It looks like they're drawing minority coalition opportunity districts to draw them because they have anticipated how they think the district court in D.C. is going to come out.       You do.       We -- we'll let you go on for a little longer.     We may have a few more questions.       Counsel, I have -- your position -- I understand you're straddling a position.     That's why you're sitting in the back rather than the front row between the two parties.     But it's a little unsatisfying because what you say we should do when we are all under the gun of very strict time limitations is we should send it back to the district court so it can give a greater explanation of what it's done. Isn't that going to be very wasteful?     I mean, it's kind of an odd order from this Court to send to a district court saying, you know, tell us more.       Maybe a brief answer.     Thank you.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garza. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSE GARZA ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES       I'm sorry.     I'm not -- I didn't --       I don't mean to interrupt, but I didn't follow that.     So long as a district has been challenged in D.C., the court in Texas should not accept it?       And that's right, but -- but it goes the other way when you say they can't approve something that's been challenged.     Aren't you assuming that the plaintiffs are right?       And that's an inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C.       The constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act isn't at issue here, right?       Okay.     Maybe you could turn for a moment to the issue that I see on Joint Appendix 146 and 147.     They don't say a minority coalition opportunity district just happened to emerge. It said that district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district.     And we've never held that it is appropriate or even permissible to draw a district where you're putting in together two minorities, two different minority groups.     And it seems to me that that raises all sorts of different concerns. It's one thing under the Voting Rights Act to say that this group votes as a bloc and has been discriminated against in its ability to elect representatives of its choice.     It's another thing to say that two different minority groups are put together because they share some particular view so that one candidate is going to be each of theirs candidate -- candidates of choice.     That goes quite a step further from what we've upheld under the Voting Rights Act.     And here you have the district court creating that in the absence of any State expression of a desire to create that type of -- of district.       Oh, it is.     It says --       New district 33 was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district.     I don't see how that can be read any way other than saying -- saying when we sat down and drew it, we drew this one as a minority coalition opportunity district.       I'm sorry.     When you say something can be read differently than that and say because they said something else somewhere else, that's not responsive.       I'm sorry.     Why -- why do you care -- why do they care then that it was drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district? You're saying they didn't do that at all.     They just followed precinct lines and everything else.     Why would they say something?       When -- so, when do you --       And when do you expect our decision on the appeal from the district court in D.C.? (Laughter.)
11-770 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, we don't have anything like that in this case.     We have them getting into a car, driving almost a mile away and being stopped at that point.       As they're executing the warrant, I don't remember, was the -- did the individual know that they were executing the warrant in this case?       Oh, okay.       So the danger to them is not at all like the situation with the dog and the armed guy just off the property.       That's an argument in Summers I just don't understand.     The argument is you can detain the people because they might want to give the officers assistance.     Well, if they want to give them assistance, they don't have to be detained.       It seems odd, you know, we're going to tie -- we're not going to tie you up -- we're going to keep you here, you can't leave because we think you might tell us where the drugs are.       If they want to do that, they can.     The question is whether you can detain them in the hope that they will decide to help you --       -- to give you the key to the cabinet.       Yes, but the question is whether you have to detain them to do something you're saying they'd want to do.
11-796 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Sherry? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE       Well, but I mean, this -- the reason it's never is because this is an entirely different case.     It's the reason it's here because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented articles.     So I don't think it gets you very far to say that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that way either.     We have never applied the Reinvention Doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant seed.       So when -- when are the patent rights exhausted in the seed?       I'm putting aside all the contracts and stuff.       That sounds like the patent rights haven't been exhausted then.       You mean its been exhausted with respect to the one bean?       That's always the case because it's a very -- the other cases haven't involved the -- this situation where you are talking about a self-regenerating product.       Well, we haven't had that case either. (Laughter.)       Sure.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       No, I mean I'm serious.     I mean, your example, it seems to me, is not quite on point because it's not a situation where the intended use of the vaccine necessarily results in regeneration of it.     In your hypothetical, CVS was going to some lab and making more, right?

ROSENTHAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, but like a lot of criminal penalties, that's the whole point.     They keep people from doing crimes.     It doesn't seem to me to be very probative to say we've never had to throw anybody in jail or we never had to prosecute anybody criminally.     They have a coercive effect that a private operator cannot avail itself of.       Right.     And I've heard of facial attacks to criminal statutes.
11-817 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gifford. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN P.

What if the judge has before him or her a record, this is where the dog went to school and it's a bona fide school, this is where the dog was certified, he's trained every -- every, you know, couple of weeks or whatever it is, and the judge says, do you have any field records, and the officer says, no, and the drug says -- the judge says, well, then no probable cause.     That's reversible error, right?       You have, I guess, experts testify about whether -- what constitutes a good training program.       What's the magic number?     What percentage of accurate alerts or inaccurate is enough for probable cause?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY BARNETT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       We are -- we are having an elaborate discussion, and you did in -- in the briefs, about whether or not this was a claim that was waived below.     No court has addressed that yet.     We're a court of review, not first view. So it seems to me that one option for the Court, since we did reformulate the question, is to answer the question and then send it back for the court to determine whether or not the parties adequately preserved that option or not -- that objection or not.       Well, fine.     I mean, and the district court, presumably, can decide based on the proceedings and all that below, all the scars and mess-ups, whether or not it was adequately preserved or not.       Counsel, it -- it seems to me that your answer to Justice Sotomayor, which is whether it's more likely than not that this will be something that can be used at trial, one way to capture that is whether or not this evidence is usable, right?       More likely than not whether it can be used at trial, that sounds like, is it usable?       Well, I know the reason you're hesitating. (Laughter.)

11-889 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Blatt? ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Are they licensed?       Anywhere close to of the 25 percent they claim entitlement to?       I was hoping you did. (Laughter.)       I'm talking about Subbasin 5.       Texans.       Well, it never -- it never says that.     I mean, that's why we have a case.     It never says it has to be from your State. And I appreciate your -- the focus in your argument on State sovereignty, but this is an interstate Compact.     And the whole point of interstate compacts is that we have to -- each State has to give up a little here or a little there to solve a problem. So I -- I guess it's -- I don't know why these basic principles of State sovereignty apply in the context of an interstate compact.       You feel a lot of what?       Oh.       You are representing Oklahoma.       But that's the same problem.     Even if you take within State, all of these people, if they were applying for water in Texas as well, there'd be the same issue there.     One of them would beat the other one.     It's a question of priority. You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should have -- well, not absolute priority, but -       Well, I thought that was what your -- the other side does envision, that it doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders, but it's bound by the agreement, the Compact.     Compacts compromise the individual State sovereignty.     That's the whole point of them.
11-8976 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Harrington? ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       But what if it is?       If it is charged in the indictment?       What he's saying is that it wasn't proven to be within the limitations period with respect to him.       But you've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy. You've indicted an individual, and it's not clear to me why you don't have to show that that was -- that that individual's conduct was within the statute of limitations period.       At least, when he comes forward with -- under the burden of production, with evidence suggesting the opposite.       Well, but Mr. Kramer says it's not that big a deal, I mean, you don't have to do -- he says you don't have to do anything at all.       Justice Kennedy?       All of this is questions for the jury under -- under the Petitioners' view, right?       Well, but that last point seems to me spurious itself because, to prove withdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in the conspiracy in the first place.     So if he doesn't have a good withdrawal defense, it's unlikely that he would raise it because it would cost him any argument he has against participation in a conspiracy in the first place.       Well, but, I mean, that works in a civil case.     But, I mean, in a criminal case, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my -- my first argument is that, I withdrew from this horrendous conspiracy that's been going on.       Or then I wasn't a part of it after that. That's a little different in a criminal context.       You have -- you have to prove that every defendant did?       Let me -- so you charge ten people as participating in this conspiracy, and the jury determines that one wasn't, then everybody's off the hook?       So you don't have to prove --       Yes.       You have to treat them as individuals.       Which is what your friend is trying to argue for in this case?       Well, when you say it wouldn't have made a difference in this case, you're basically saying you had some good evidence.     But a jury could have always decided against you, right?       Well, but I think it's a little much to say it wouldn't make a difference because the jury would definitely have ruled in your favor.
11-9307 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wall. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Counsel, I -- it strikes me that we are having a very unusual discussion, in that we are competing policy considerations that have been raised.     This is a -- a rule with particular language, and I don't think we'd be having this type of a discussion if we were dealing with a statute.     I think there would be a different focus.     Obviously, the policy concerns would be raised but in a different context. Do you have authority for the proposition that we have more flexibility in interpreting the Federal rules than we would in interpreting the statute?       I mean, it highlight -- it -- just to take a moment -- it was highlighted for me in your brief when you said, well, Johnson, there was a special circumstance, so they read this rule, then, this way.     This is not a special circumstance, so we are going to read the rule a different way.     Is it because these are rules as opposed to statutes?       Counsel --

11-94 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       You agree, don't you, that the statement in Oregon v. Ice was pure dicta?       It's kind of odd, though, isn't it?     I mean, to some extent, this is a little easier case for you, because it does involve a corporation.     But there are statutes where the amount of imprisonment and the amount of a fine can both increase based on a particular fact.       And under your submission, if you have -- you know, say a defendant who is subject to 1 year, and that if a particular fact is found, he's subject to 2 years, a fine of 20 but then 40, the judge would be constitutionally prohibited from increasing the prison sentence but would be perfectly free to increase the fine --       -- including in a situation where the fine might be a lot more serious than the -- the time in prison.       Sure, he operated -- he operated in a reasonable way.     But we give juries the discretion to be unreasonable.     It would not -- juries often compromise.     So, if the instructions and the verdict told the jury you can find the defendant, you know, guilty for 1 day or whatever it is -- the 30 million; 50,000 or 30 million -- it would not be at all unusual for the jury to debate and say, well, let's find him guilty for 10 million.       And return that verdict.     The judge is constrained by reason in a way that the jury is not, and that's sort of -- that's part of the protection the Sixth Amendment provided.       A very -- very simple matter for the government to ask for jury findings on the questions at issue in this case, right?       Well, your --       I'm sorry.       Your argument isn't limited to corporations, though.       Sure.
11-9540 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Horwich. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       The point would expand -- this would expand the problem that you've identified, that the Shepard approach, the existence of the documents, how carefully they've been developed, it would expand that fortuity to a far greater number of cases.       The -- I'm not sure that it achieves greater sentencing equity when you have two defendants who have done exactly the same thing in California, and because of the fortuity of what the plea colloquy looked like in one case as opposed to another, when it really didn't matter one way or another in that situation, one person qualifies under ACCA and the other doesn't.       And presumably I agree that you don't have -- you don't have empirical evidence.     But given how -- it does seem to me that it's a broad expansion of the category of cases to which you would apply the modified categorical approach under your position.       You can.

12-10 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bowker? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. BOWKER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       I don't see why this is a -- you talk about banning their speech.     The government is just picking out who is an appropriate partner to -- to assist in this project.     It wants to go and find people who, like them, are opposed to prostitution, and all they want to do is make sure that you're opposed to prostitution. It's like any other sort of condition -- you know, we want to make sure that you haven't been convicted of tax fraud over the last 10 years, so sign a certification that you -- you haven't.     Yes, it's related to speech, but the whole program is about that. Why would they want to sign up with somebody who didn't share the objectives of the program?       So it would be a different case, in your -- your view, as if -- when they have those criteria, they have one of them is, oh, by the way, you must agree with the objective of the program, which is to eliminate, to the extent possible, prostitution and sex trafficking?       So let's just say the government wants to have an ad campaign to discourage people from smoking and they are looking for ad agencies to -- to help them with it.     And an ad agency comes in and says, look, we are the best ad agency there is; we know exactly how to get to the markets; we know what's persuasive and all of that. And yet -- and then the ad agency says -- Page 36 you know, come work at our agency if you smoke; we think smoking is okay; we have smoking breaks; we do all this. The government can't take that into account?       Well, isn't that part of what's going on here?     One of the things we want to do is eradicate prostitution and sex trafficking, and we want you to get that message out, and the one thing we're sure of is if you're not in -- if you're in favor -- or you're not opposed to it because you have other objectives, you're not going to help get the message out at all?       But that is saying this is what's happening in Rust, okay?     And Rust is okay.     That's very different from saying, it has to be that way, and, if it's any other way, it's no good.     It seems to me that you're just taking the limitation on the facts in Rust and saying that is an absolute requirement, which is a misreading of the case.       You can always choose me, too. (Laughter.)       Your approach, it seems to me, is just dealing with the breadth of the program.     If the program here solely concerned prostitution and sex trafficking and not other areas where you say, look, we do a great job in these other areas, we just don't get involved in that area. But, if the sole program was on prostitution and sex trafficking, you -- you wouldn't have a leg to Page 45 stand on, would you?       So you're an organization --       I just want to make sure I -- the government has a program to develop water resources, and let's say it's in South Africa before the abolition of apartheid.     And there's a pro-apartheid group and an anti-apartheid group. And you're saying the government can only decide which one is better at digging wells, and it can't say, we're going to prefer the anti-apartheid group?       Viewpoint on Page 48 apartheid.     It can't say -- so the other one shows we've got a better record, we dig the wells quicker.       It goes to the effectiveness of the program.     It's related to it.     The United States doesn't want the company or the organization that goes into a village and says, we're going to bring you know, this is from the United States, we're bringing you fresh water, and it's a -- it's a pro-apartheid group. That does undermine what they are trying to do, just as in this case, to have the organization providing the services that your organization provides be identified as as an organization that doesn't want to abolish prostitution.

12-1038 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Chemerinsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   So you raised a you -- you mentioned the green line, and Mr. Horwich represented some facts about it outside the record, guite properly alerted us that it was outside the record, I just want to give you a chance to respond to that.   You need the express permission of the base commander to drive down the road. It's just that he has given it to -- to the public at large.   Because it's been ceded by the United States for the convenience of the traveling public.   I thought you just answered the guestion from Justice Sotomayor by saying, no, no, the utility easement doesn't work because the military commander has not granted permission to anybody else to use that easement. Here, we have a public road easement, and you said that's different. And my guestion was: No, it's not, because the military commander has given permission to use that easement. Now, I want to know what distinguishes the two cases.   Well, that's usually the sort of determination that's left to the military commander. I can think of a lot of reasons why the commander would not want a gathering of people on the road, but would be willing to let people drive through the road.   Well, it indicates, as the -- the barment order does, that he does see some kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who's vandalized the base in the past.   Is there -- can there be a temporary forfeiture of First Amendment rights?   Well, I'm talking about what this case is about, which is the temporary exclusion. Would your case be the same if Mr. Apel was barred for one year?   No, he can traverse it. He can traverse. There -- there's no guestion of that. Could he be barred from participating in protests for a year because he vandalized the base?   Now, here, as I understand it, he was barred permanently, subject to the right of him to apply for removal of the barment.   To avoid -- just to interrupt -- to avoid grave constitutional doubts.   I'm sorry. The Rule of Lenity, you said in favor of a criminal defendant.   We're talking about barment here. Is that a criminal sanction?   Right, but this doesn't -- you're not allowed to collaterally attack the barment decision.

12-1117 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Bash. Mr. Smith. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY K. SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   He had just -- he had just exited the interstate.   And so isn't that a good reason for putting your brakes on? He is not going to be going 100 miles an hour down the side street, is 3 he?   Are officers -- are officers trained to use their weapons to shoot tires?   Well, are they trained -- are they trained to use their weapons to shoot out the tires of fleeing cars? My understanding is that that's not appropriate police behavior.   Let's say there's only one police officer chasing this fellow. The same thing happens. You know, he turns off the interstate after the 100-mile-an-hour chase on the highway and stops; the officer gets out of the car; he starts taking away again. Would it be appropriate for that officer to apply lethal force to prevent the vehicle from resuming the high-speed chase?   I've given you all the facts. I've given you all the pertinent facts. Is it appropriate for that officer to apply lethal force?   We're at the -- let's start with the same place that he was at in this case.   Everything is the same except there's one police officer and he goes off the interstate at that point; the same thing happens, but there's only one. And either -- the officer gets out of the car and at that point, the fellow takes off again resuming the chase, endangering the -- the public by -- by doing so. Is -- at that point, can the officer apply lethal force?   Not two sequences whatever. Just as I explained. Both cars are stopped; the officer gets out of the car; at that point, the driver that led the chase takes off again. That's all the facts you need to know.   No, no. Not this case. The case that I have hypothesized.   No.   Is there any circumstance in which lethal force is appropriate once the officer has stopped the car?   Well, when?   No. Doesn't know --   What -- what is the legal significance of the number of shots? Is -- is this case any different because 15 shots were fired as opposed to one or two?   But even -- well, again, what standing does the driver have to complain about the threat to civilians who are in the area?   There are two ways in which the public is endangered. You're -- the point you're making is that if the police are firing somebody in the public might get hit fired by a bullet. The point the officers make, that if you allow him to escape and -- and continue a high-speed chase, there are other people, innocent people, who might get injured or killed by the car. Now, how were the officers supposed to decide on the spot whether there is a greater danger that people are going to get hit by a stray bullet or there is a greater danger that people are going to get hit by the car?   So you're saying they can't apply lethal force because they may not be successful in -- in killing the driver?   I thought the car wasn't moving when the shots were first fired?

12-1146 +++$+++    Thank you, General Mitchell. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   About the Best Available Control Technology, I think I have an idea of what that looks like with respect to sources already regulated, because they're relating to the NAAQS. You know, filters, scrubbers and all that; I'm sure it's oversimplified. But what does Best Available Control Technology look like with respect to greenhouse gases?   Right. But am I am I right because the greenhouse gases do not affect ambient air guality in a way that the current or the NAAQS provisions do? I mean, you're dealing with regulation of energy usage, right, as opposed to emissions of lead, emissions of the other NAAQS provisions?   The same sort of thing as with -- for domestic uses, as the energy efficient light bulbs.   No, but my point is it relates to energy consumption as opposed to particulate emission.   If you -- if you regulate -- I'm talking about your two distinct arguments in your -- in your brief. If you prevail on the first: In other words, greenhouse gases may be regulated with respect to sources that are already subject to permitting, my understanding, it gets you to 83 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.   Prevailing on the second argument gets you to 8 6 percent.   So this is a fight -- putting aside your first argument -- about an additional 3 percent, and yet according to the Petitioners that brings in this huge regulatory problem, of, you know, regulating the high school football game and what-not.   The lights at the game.   I'm sorry. I didn't get an answer to -- hear an answer to Justice Alito's guestion and I think it's an important one. There are currently criteria pollutants under the -- under the Act. Let's assume you find out that there's a particular substance that does cause harm to ambient air guality that is not already covered, and you publish a NAAQ for that, can you decide that 100 and 250, you want to regulate at a different threshold, just like you have here. I mean, is this a particular assertion of authority only with respect to greenhouse gases or does it cover any pollutant under the Act?   Can you publish a NAAQ for greenhouse gases?   Okay. Let's pick -- there is a pollutant that isn't currently regulated, and science advances to the point where you think it should be regulated. Can you change the 100 and 250 thresholds for that new covered pollutant?   That's the 80 -- that's the 8386 guestion, right?   Well, that has local effects. I mean, everybody knows there's smog in Los Angeles versus Montana, right?   You've got to follow -- you've got to follow the plain text of the statute there.   Yeah, but the plan of the statute is 250 tons per year, too; and you've changed that to 100,000 tons per year.   But that's not cited in your brief, is it?   Well, you've got five extra minutes, to be -- to be fair. And one thing --   You had already gotten going, I didn't want to disturb -- you don't think that greenhouse gases should be regulated at the 250-tons-per-year level, right? You said Congress did not intend that, and it would be absurd.   So what level do you think they should be regulated at? In other words, what intelligible principle are you taking from the statute to say we're going to -- we're at 100 now. We're going to aim for 50 or -- in other words, if you had all the resources you need, what level would you pick as the proper one --   -- other than -- since it's not 250?
12-1163 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dunner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD R. DUNNER ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT   Well, but then it reads four to three on one issue, then it has, as in this case, conflicting cases within its own docket. So I'm not sure it's succeeding in bringing about uniformity.   Well, I'm just saying, the point -- you're quite correct, the Federal Circuit was established to bring about uniformity in patent law, but they seem to have a great deal of disagreement among themselves and are going back and forth in particular cases, in this area specifically, about what the appropriate approach is.   Well, what about Judge Moore's point that when you're talking about pure issues of patent law maybe you're right, but when you're talking about baselessness, that's something that the district courts actually have more experience with, whether it's under EAJA, whether it's under AEDPA, whether it's under qualified immunity. That's an issue they see all the time, so maybe they are more expert than the Federal Circuit.   Well, you've got to stop charging such outrageous fees. (Laughter.)   Oh, no.

They don't have a choice, do they? I mean, it's --   Maybe the reason you don't have records on this, which strikes me as pretty unusual that the government doesn't know what it owns, is that for decades, you didn't think that you owned a reversionary interest.

12-1200 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Pottow. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN POTTOW ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   You would concede that your case would be -- you would not have a case if we were dealing with factual findings?   I'm sorry. Go ahead.   You're right. We've been talking about backup arguments to backup arguments. Your central argument is that the consent of the parties can overcome what Stern identified as a structural separation of powers problem.   Well, I guess that's my guestion. Is there any other case where we've said the consent of the parties can overcome a constitutional structural separation of powers?   We've already told the district court, haven't we, that its Article III status is infringed when he refers or when there's a reference to a non-Article III tribunal?   So if the district court refers the case to his law partners, and that's fine with the parties, that law partner can enter a final judgment in the case subject only to appellate review?   Is that what you're saying?   The Special Masters do not enter final judgment subject only to appellate review.   But the appellate review is the important thing. The Article III court, under your submission, is giving up its authority to enter factual findings. It's giving that authority to a non-Article III tribunal, and it can only review those findings under clearly erroneous standard.   Well, I know it's the current system under the magistrate judges. We held that unconstitutional in the bankruptcy context.   Finish your sentence.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT   That's what I thought severability was. If you carve -- if you find part of it unconstitutional, you ask whether what is left can stand. You don't say that we're going to rewrite what is left.   Or it may be because the particular claim at issue in Stern was one that wasn't expected to arise in the normal course in bankruptcy proceedings.   Your -- your position is -- I mean, the authority to decide cases, which is our Constitutional birthright, we said in Stern that Congress can't take that away from us. And your position is that two parties who come in off the street, if they agree, they can take that away from us.   No, it's the parties, the parties who are --   You said, "It's the consent of the parties that allows a proceeding we have determined to be unconstitutional to go forward."   The point of everything that you said is, they do not comply with Article III.   Does the district court have that authority after the entry of judgment?   Arbitration is a matter of contract between two parties. Nothing happens in an arbitration until you get a district court to enter a judgment enforcing the contract. It seems to me totally different from the situation we're talking about here.   Courts enforce contracts all the time. They don't enter judgments beyond their Article III authority simply because the two parties before them agree that they should.
12-123 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. MCConnell. Mr. Palmore? Page 27 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       When did you first Page 28 raise the argument that it was jurisdictional?       And now you are -- now you are changing back again and saying it's not?       You relied on that when you got to rehearing.     You didn't rely on that before you went before the Ninth Circuit, right?       I have to say -- I think it comes with less than good grace for you to criticize the other side for not having raised a particular argument.     But I do want to clarify that you have no objection at this point for reversing the Ninth Circuit on the ground that they erred in saying that this -- they should have dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.

12-126 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Readler? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHAD A. READLER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Counsel, you say, on page 17 of your brief, that this Court has applied the manifest-injustice exception to limits created by Congress.     What's your best case for that?       What -- what do you mean, acts of Congress?     Your sentence says, applied at the limits created by Congress.     I read that to mean statutes of limitations.     But that's wrong?       With 2255 -- remind me?       And said what with respect to time --       Said what with respect to the time limits?       So -- so, when you said limits, you didn't mean time limits; you meant substantive limits?       Procedural limits. Do you have a case that applies it to time limits? Which, of course, is the question we have here.       Right.     But you said limits created by Congress.     So just -- I mean, I should read "limits created by Congress" not to mean time limits, but procedural or other limits.       Right.     And I guess that's the point of my questioning and your friend's position.     There have never been any time limits created by Congress that have been abrogated by a manifest-injustice exception.       Right.     And the difference is, in Holland, we are dealing with equitable tolling, which had applied as far back as -- you know, whatever the law goes to limitations; in other words, equitable tolling, which is different from the abrogation, I think, that you are asking for.       Well, it's -- I'm not sure that's right.     They don't want to definitely file within one year, if they don't have anything to say.     You know, if it takes a certain amount of time before they either acquire it legitimately or can find somebody or -- I don't know, in this case -- you know, the codefendant dies, everybody has no reason any more -- you know, to object and pin it on him. There are a lot of reasons that it's in some of these prisoners' interest to drag things out and then to file.     They don't have anything to say within the one year and need time to either, from your point of view, legitimately develop the evidence or, from your friend's point of view, to concoct it.       Your friend responds to that point, I think, by saying that every State allows collateral review in that instance and that what we're talking about is simply preclusion of the second bite at the apple -- or a third bite at the apple, I guess, by -- by assumption, in the Federal system.       What about the actual innocence claim?       Is that the most -- is that the most -- I thought I understood your friend to say -- he can correct me if I'm wrong -- that every State has an avenue for considering that.       And how long did your -       So is this established after -- after some kind of evidentiary hearing, the delay, whether he delayed for a particular purpose or not?       Why -- why did your client wait 5 years after the last affidavit?       Well, but, I mean, the whole question -- and your friend made the -- made the point -- the question is how many are filed, in how many cases does the claim arise, not how few times it's upheld.       How do you know which of these are meritorious and which aren't?     Is this the meritorious -- I assume you think this is a meritorious one? (Laughter.)       And your friend says nobody can reasonably think this person is innocent. Maybe he has constitutional claims.     But, if you look at the evidence, is this something, at the -- a preliminary stage, you look and say, oh, this guy's clearly innocent, and this goes forward? Or is it one that you can cast aside?

Then you've got three years to go ahead.   Well, not just injunctions. I mean, let's say they -- you know, they released the Blu-ray version or whatever, and so, in a particular two-year period, you make a lot of money, and the suit should have been brought before that.

12-133 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D.

The only thing you've got to prove is it's going to cost you $25,000.     That's an odd position to put them in.       What is -- tell me how the no -- no sharing of information and confidentiality, how does that work again?     You can't, if you're a trade association, get together and say, I think we should have a study of Amex's whatever.     And then you put together the study, and then one of your members says -- you know, that's a good study, I'm going to go -- go to arbitration.     They can't do that?       Well, what if you do -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of your trade associations, they think this is -- you know, they're not talking about particular arbitration or anything.     They just prepare a -- a report, and then once you see the report, you say, my gosh, I had no idea, and then you file your claim for arbitration.       It seems to me my point is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it seems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be very difficult to enforce.       We'll afford you some rebuttal time.

12-135 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katz? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. KATZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       I think that's inconsistent with the law that's developed -- actually in fairness to the arbitrator, after he'd made his initial decision, which is that if you have something that just says disputes and doesn't address the issue of class arbitration at all, that you can't have class arbitration.       Could you get back -- I'm sorry, go ahead.       Getting back to Justice Breyer's question, I thought his -- First Options is fairly strong authority for him because there you have a situation with the arbitrator determining that a particular entity or individual is bound by the agreement.     And we said that's something that we will review de novo, without deference.     Why isn't it the same here? In other words, not everything an arbitrator says is subject to the deferential standard of review, even if he purports to say I'm interpreting the agreement, which I think the arbitrator in First Options did?       But the difference is in First Options.     The one thing First Options says is the question of who's going to be bound by arbitration is decided by the court de novo.     And in the class context, you are binding 19,999 individuals who did not agree to be bound, depending upon the particular interpretation.       And this may not -- I'm not sure it's relevant, but it -- it might be.     I thought the purpose of arbitration was to decide these things quickly.     This has been going on 11 years, right? (Laughter.)       It's not -- it's not a facetious question because I think one of the concerns about class arbitration is that it -- it eliminates the supposed benefits of arbitration because you can't have sort of quick and rough and ready determinations when it's going to bind 20,000 people.       Well, but surely --       I'm sorry.     Finish your answer.       But under -- under -- that provision, the partiality provision, is addressed to favoring one party as opposed to another party. I think Justice Kennedy's question goes to an institutional concern about an arbitrator making a decision of this sort that goes, not to -- not to partiality between parties, but a problem about the way the system would work, that would create an incentive for an arbitrator, implicit or explicit, to reach a ruling that expands his authority.       I'm sorry to just interrupt.     For most of that two centuries, courts refused to enforce arbitration agreements.     That's the whole reason we have the FAA.

12-138 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blackman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, the problem is --   You're -- it's a point on which I'm regularly confused. You just said if we had this provision in a contract with -- a private contract that said you must sue us, but there, you have already a formed separate agreement to arbitrate. And it seems to me clear that those -- what do you call them, preconditions or whatever, that that -- the argument that that's for the arbitrator to decide. They may well decide that -- you know, you didn't comply, so you don't get to arbitrate. But it seems to me, typically, under First Options and Howsam, that is for the arbitrator. Now, what makes it distinct in your case? What, is it just the order that they're in? Or what? Or is it something special about a sovereign's agreement?   It all gets down to the question, how do we tell -- you know, the contract formation from the blue paper, right? I mean, if it says -- you know, we agree to arbitrate, and we use these rules and those rules say you have to have it on blue paper, and it's not on blue paper, they say, oh, we didn't agree to have it not on blue paper. How do we distinguish between those two scenarios?

12-142 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       I'm not so sure -- I'm not so sure it works that way because of the jury point.     They didn't say that yes, you can market this drug, it benefits -- you know, 99.9 percent of the people, but there is that 0.1 percent, and you're going to have to compensate that person. They said the risks outweigh the benefits, period.     So you should not market this at all.     And it does seem inconsistent with the -- the Federal regime.       Well, what do you in that case?     You've got one jury saying the risks outweigh the benefits, can't do it.     And then you're saying well, later, there might be another jury saying yes, you can.       So you are saying there is a huge difference between saying you didn't put the warning in, so you are liable for $9 million, and saying, you are liable for $15 million, but if you put the warning in, you are only liable for 9 million?       But -- but just to get back to my -- to my question.     You say there is a difference between saying, you have to put on warning and you are going to be liable if you don't, and saying, you are liable no matter no matter what because it's strict liability, but if you put on a warning it's reduced.     If you are a drug manufacturer, you are supposed to see a difference in those two situations?       Well, just -- I'm sorry to interrupt you.     But your friend on the other side, of course, says PLIVA involves strict liability as well.     So it did not say you must change the label.
12-144 +++$+++        Mr. Olson? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Mr. Olson, I cut off your friend before he could get into the merits.     So I think it's only fair -       Well, I think it's only fair to treat you the same.     Perhaps you could address your jurisdictional argument?       I suppose there might be people out there with their own personal standing, someone who performs marriages and would like that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to perform same-sex marriages, or other people.     We seem to be addressing the case as if the only options are the proponents here or the State.     I'm not sure there aren't other people out there with individual personalized injury that would satisfy Article III.       You should feel free to move on to the merits.       I'm not sure, counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right to view this as excluding a particular group.     When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals.     The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples. It is -- yes, you can say that it serves some of the other interests where it makes sense to include them, but not all the interests.     And it seems to me, your friend argues on the other side, if you have an institution that pursues additional interests, you don't have to include everybody just because some other aspects of it can be applied to them.       Oh, that's only because Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California Supreme Court issued its decision.       And don't you think it's more reasonable to view it as a change by the California Supreme Court of this institution that's been around since time immemorial?       So -- so your case -- your case would be different if Proposition 8 was enacted into law prior to the California Supreme Court decision?       So it's just about -- it's just about the label in this case.       Same-sex couples have every other right, it's just about the label.       Sure.     If you tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say, this is my friend, but it changes the definition of what it means to be a friend. And that's it seems to me what the -- what supporters of Proposition 8 are saying here.     You're - all you're interested in is the label and you insist on changing the definition of the label.       How do we know - how do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a fundamental right?     That's -- you've emphasized that and you've said, well, it's because of the emotional commitment.     Maybe it is the procreative aspect that makes it a fundamental right.       Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       You don't think you're going to get away with not starting with the jurisdictional question, do you? (Laughter.)       Justice Breyer.       I don't want to -- I want you to get back to Justice Alito's other points, but is it the position of the United States that same-sex marriage is not required throughout the country?       Well, you can go on.       But you are willing to wait in the rest of the country.     You saying it's got to happen right now in California, but you don't even have a position about whether it's required in the rest of the country.       So it's got to happen right away in those States where same-sex couples have every legal right that married couples do.       But you can wait in States where they have fewer legal rights.       Can I ask you a problem about -       -- I -- it seems to me that your position that you are supporting is somewhat internally inconsistent.     We see the argument made that there is no problem with extending marriage to same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex couples are doing just fine and there is no evidence that they are being harmed. And the other argument is Proposition 8 harms children by not allowing same-sex couples to marriage.     Which is it?       But you also tell me there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex couples.
12-1493 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Palmore. 4 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Where in this  I'm sorry.   Where in the Act does -- is the basis for the requirement on the form? The form says -- you know, if you're not the actual, you're buying for somebody else. Where is that in the statute?   (A) (6)?   I think it's very -- it's very problematic to talk about the overriding purpose when you're dealing with a very sensitive compromise. There's, as far as I can tell, nothing in the language of the statute that talks about straw men or actual buyers or anything like that.   Well, but there wasn't -- there wasn't a strong lobby in Congress saying we're the group that supports Ponzi schemes, so maybe it makes more sense to have a broad construction of that provision. This language is fought over tooth and nail by people on the -- you know, gun control side and the gun ownership side. And to say -- you look at it and say well, the purpose is this, even though there's no words in the statute that have anything to do with straw purchasers, I think, is very problematic.   Well, you agree that in Justice Alito's example, that person is regulated as a gun dealer, right?   The Yellow Pages.   They're putting an ad --   Now, this -- this -- now you're talking about the second question.   And the provision that makes the -- the information that's required, makes it material -- correct me if I'm wrong -- is 922(b) (5), right? That's what requires --   Okay. Now, all that says is you have to keep the information of the person to whom you're transferring the firearm. So your argument has to be, when somebody sees the person, they realize that that means not somebody who's buying it for somebody else, right?   Yes. Yes. I know. If I assume -- if I assume you're right, then you're right.   Because then "person," you know carries with it the concept of not just the person to whom it's transferred, which is what 922(b) (5) says, but the fact that it's -- has to be the actual person who ends up with the gun.   Well, 922 --   Where -- where is that?   Well, he's not told that in the statute. He's told that in a form that was quite different from the form that was used before.
12-158 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      General, let's suppose there's a multilateral treaty, the -- the international convention to ensure that national legislatures have full authority to carry out their obligations, i.e., that the national legislature has the police power.    And Congress passes a statute saying we have the authority to prosecute purely local crimes pursuant to this international convention that the President has signed.    Any problem with that?      And just to press it further, the -- the point is that it's a transfer of authority from the States to the national legislature. I don't know why you'd look to the national legislature to say, well, we'd never do that.      At a time when the Senate was elected by the State legislatures.      I don't know why it would not be a valid exercise of the treaty power.    A case like Medellin caused serious conflict with our international obligations because we held, look, the Federal Government does not have the authority to tell the sheriff in Texas what to do.    That caused a great deal of strain in -- in our international relations. And I think the United Nations could well say, look, we don't want treaty parties to have to deal with whether it's somebody in this State or somebody in that province who has the authority, so every signatory must have the authority.    It doesn't strike me as not reasonably related to international obligations.      No, no.    I know your -- I know the case -      So the -- the purpose of my hypothetical was try to find out if there's any situation in which you believe an erosion or intrusion by the Federal Government on the police power could be a constraint against an international treaty.      Well, it seems to me that if you say there may be an outer bound but this case isn't one of them, you're subjecting yourself to the same criticisms that have been leveled against the other side, that you're proposing a case-by-case evaluation with respect to each treaty.      But there are a lot of treaties, particularly I think Justice Alito pointed out, after the World War II era where you have international conventions affecting everything.    We have international conventions on the abduction of children, international conventions that -- human rights.    They cover a vast swath of -- of subject matter. And it seems to me the only thing you're saying that is a limit on what the treaty power can be as a source for is some determination, no more - less -- no less arbitrary than the lines other people are asking us to draw between what's appropriate under the treaty power and what's not. And I just would like a fairly precise answer whether there are or are not limitations on what Congress can do with respect to the police power.    If their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their - is their power to intrude upon the police power unlimited?      Okay.    The treaty is valid.      Okay.      So you would rather have the Court determine, if we're concerned about the intrusion on the police power, whether treaties are valid or not than whether -- determine whether particular implementing legislation is valid or not.      I know this case. The point of the hypothetical is I'm trying to get your general principle.    I can imagine treaties that you would say are within the treaty power, again, particularly in the post-World War II era, but that could give rise to implementing legislation that I think would be extraordinary from the point of view of the framers and the power that it gave Congress to intrude upon State authority.      It's -- it's kind of question begging.    I mean, the whole point is that some people think we do have exactly that in this case.    Now, usually when we have a case that implicates significant and serious bilateral concerns, we get a lot of briefs and all that from our -- our treaty partners. Is -- is there any concern that's been expressed in any concrete way by them about whether Mrs. Bond is prosecuted?      No, no.    Yes.    So nothing in --      I'm sure that the people who've worked in the national branch of government, particularly for the State Department, would like to have as much authority as they can get to negotiate treaties.    We're concerned about limitations on other.    Do we have any briefs from State legislatures, State authorities, concerning intrusion on their prerogatives?
12-167 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yablon? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. YABLON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       What -- what if you have the situation where the judge is conveying purely factual information?     There's a -- a plea bargain on the table for one year and the judge says, you should know that I -- I have these cases a lot.     The last ten cases that went to trial where the defendant was found guilty, I sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years.     Pure facts. The facts might have the effect of pushing the defendant one way or another, but it's also factual information of which he ought to be aware.       Well, we do need to have a good sense of how far your -- your per se structural argument is going to reach before we decide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not.       What -- what about the hypothetical that I posed?       So if he -- if it's my example and he says, this is what I've done the past ten times, so you ought to think long and hard about whether a bargain for one year is a good deal.       It's kind of a fine line to -- to draw, isn't it?       Now -- well, but you've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you know, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in that case, maybe in this case. Most -- our precedents where we recognize structural error and -- and plain error are ones that are pretty easily categorized.     Did a magistrate conduct voir dire or did he not?     You know right away one way or the other.     Here did he participate enough?     You know, well, if he told them how many times he sentenced people this way, it's not, but if he said you ought to -- you ought to pay attention to what I'm telling you when you'd consider whether to plea or not, well, then it is. It -- it seems to me in the typical plain error cases, we're very -- the categories are very sharply defined.       I would say in both of those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost every time you've been asked a question about a difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not. And I think that's quite different than saying is the court closed or not or was the person -- you know, did he represent himself in fact or not.     And those just strike me as much easier cases.       Yes, but if you were -- if you were arguing whether or not it's -- it's categorical error when the magistrate conducts voir dire, it'd be pretty hard for somebody to come up with a tough hypothetical.       How do we -- if we're giving this guidance, what do we say about the fact that he had a different judge subsequent to this, that he filed a speedy trial motion after this coercion, to suggest that he wasn't coerced all that much. Are we supposed to take all that into consideration, too?
12-17 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. General Getchell? ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS      So the -- if I understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is because of the added overhead costs?       Well, I know. But -- but -- so why don't you do it anyways?    Just --    just as I asked your friend, it doesn't seem like that big a deal.    It doesn't seem like that big a deal for you either.    If you can recoup overhead costs from people who request -- and I'd assume you would be able to -- why don't other people -- people from West Virginia may have interest in how Virginia government operates, too. And -- and, again, if -- what cost is there to you, other than overhead?     You don't want to keep how Virginia government operates quiet from outsiders when you let in -- its citizens get the access, do you?      Well, that's under the Privileges -- the Privileges and Immunities argument.      Okay.    But what about the Dormant Commerce Clause?      No, I know -- I understand your argument.     I'm just asking you why bother?    I mean, what -- what's the -- and that's certainly pertinent to some of the Commerce Clause analysis.    And I haven't heard anything, other than the overhead costs.    And I think you can recoup that from the requesters.      Why not?      Well, you've got to maintain and generate the database, anyway, for Virginia citizens who are going to ask for it.    This is not an added cost.     It's an added cost if you have to hire an additional person to handle -- as far as I can tell, just these two people.      It's no more complicated a system if you let out-of-Staters have access, too.    You say we want a simple system.    It's    going to be the same system, whether you win or lose.
12-207 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Mr. Shanmugam? ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, that is right. But I'm curious as to why your position is that -- let's say he served his time.     He's no longer subject to the criminal justice system.     He's not on parole; he's not a probationer.     You concede that the DNA evidence can be taken from him, correct?       What is the pertinence of the fact -- I mean, this is not something that people are or can keep private.     I mean, if you're in the interview room or something, you take a drink of water, you leave, you're done.     I mean, they can examine the DNA from that drink of water.       Doesn't that compromise the -- the expectation of privacy?       No, it's not a --       My question was not trying to get at whether it's a search or not.     It's whether -- it's getting at the reasonableness of the expectation of privacy that the -- your DNA is protected from examination when it's left wherever you happened to have been.       Well, I mean, isn't that part of the -- isn't that part of the question, whether there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in a person's DNA?       Well, I know, but you're simply just -- you're -- I guess that's begging the question.     And -- well I'd just be repeating my question -- how legitimate is it to you to expect privacy in something that the police can access without you even knowing about it, without any voluntary or involuntary -- if you take a drink of water, if you leave behind a cigarette butt?       There are two different -- two different interests.     One is we want to solve unsolved crimes; and the other is we want to be sure -- we have someone in our custody, and we want to be sure, before he is released back into the community, that he isn't a person who has committed five violent crimes before that. Now, your brief says, well, the only interest here is the law enforcement interest.     And I found that persuasive because of the concern that it's going to take months to get the DNA back anyway, so they are going to have to release him or not before they know it. But if we are in a position where it now takes 90 minutes -- or will soon take 90 minutes to get the information back, I think that's entirely different because, there, you can find out whether -- it's just tied in with the bail situation, do you want to release him or not?       Well, that's because -- that's because we are not yet at a situation where it takes 90 minutes.     Sure, it's not going to do you any good if it's taking 4 months or whatever it took in this case. But, if it's at the point where it's 90 minutes, it would be critical to make that determination.       Well, let's put it this way.     Let's -- let's say the judge or the magistrate is going to make a bail determination and he says, well, it's important to me to know whether you are going to commit another crime. So we are not saying you have to give a DNA sample, but it will enter into my calculation if you refuse to do it.       Well, what does that mean?     Is that okay or not?       Well, we do it -- doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer?     You are pulled over, they say, we want you to take a Breathalyzer test.     They say, you don't have to, but, if you don't, your license is suspended for 6 months or whatever. Why isn't that the same thing.       You -- you disclose all of this intimate private information when you take a drink of water and leave -- leave the glass behind.
12-236 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fishman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FISHMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       So if -- if you're preparing one of these filings, and you're all set to go, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh, it doesn't look like we're going to be on time.     You should still go ahead and file because you might be able to apply for attorneys' fees.     While if you file it the day that it's due and you find out the day after, oh, my gosh, we weren't on time, then there's no question that you could apply for attorneys' fees.       My hypothetical was not that you had two days and you made it in time, but that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on further research, oh, this isn't going to look like we're going to comply.     We thought we had the time, but we don't.     You should still go ahead and file, right, so that you might be able to get the fees?       Well, that's a tough position, isn't it?     I mean, if you have got a difficult and tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees; but if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees.       I thought you were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and good faith.       So is one reason that should affect the exercise of discretion is that you didn't comply with the statute of limitations?       Is the -- what's the relationship between your position and equitable tolling?     I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that there was a fair amount of confusion about when the statute of limitations might run or that's your position.     I would think a lot of the cases where the attorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will involve things like -- you know, I was delayed by Hurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we tried to file, and it got lost in the mail. Are those things that -- I mean, should that be considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or under -- under your idea that you don't have to file on time anyway? Page 37       I understand that, but I would assume the more typical case is when you miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline. And I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not sufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is, therefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys' fees?

12-25 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement? ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       One thing we also know about the "in connection with" language is that we have said, it can't really mean "in connection with," as broadly as that -- the Morales case, I guess, it has to have a more narrow meaning.     Otherwise, everything would be covered.       It would be -- it would be a very poor lawyer who couldn't figure out how to write this -- the letter he's going to send out in a way that it could not be said to be investigation, as opposed to solicitation. If you have a problem with the windshield wipers, you just send a letter saying, there is this big problem with windshield wipers.     I am a lawyer, I'm representing -- or I hope to represent, or I will represent a group of people who have this problem, and I think we will recover some damages.     Would you like to be a witness in that case? That is in anticipation of litigation, but it's also, quite plainly, an effort to solicit clients, not just witnesses.       So where -- where is the line?       No, that's the words -- that's the words of the statute.     I'm trying to figure out what they mean.     If you think there is some type of solicitation that the statute was meant to prohibit, how do you draw a line that prohibits that, but allows the sort of thing that you want to do?       That doesn't have to be filed in court, that may just be --       -- residing in the brain of any lawyer who's looking for work.       Well, that's -- well, that's right.     I understand your point, that this is -- they're not separate categories, and there's no overlap.     But the word is "harmonizing," and the problem is we have to give some limiting construction to "in connection with." And it seems to me that, if you are involved in that endeavor, it does make sense to see how what you're going to cover under the "in connection with" relates to what's exempt under the other provisions.       Exactly.       Well, if they are -- if they were thinking they might bring an ADA suit --       Your position does create a special -- the point your friend makes -- it does create a special exemption from a solicitation bar for lawyers.     Lawyers can solicitate -- you know, Acme Products can't.       In connection with something they hope might someday become litigation, depending upon the answers they get.       Would you want to start the suit?     It doesn't matter in your position.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE       On the first one, is there any case where all the parties agreed with the decision below and we upheld appellate jurisdiction? Any case?       All the parties agreed with the decision below and we nonetheless upheld appellate jurisdiction.       No, it wasn't raised -- it wasn't raised or addressed, and that had the distinct situation of an appeal, direct appeal from an Article I tribunal.       Okay.     So putting Lovett aside, since none of this was discussed, is there any -- any case?       So this is totally unprecedented.     You're asking us to do something we have never done before to reach the issue in this case.       No, it's not just - it's not unusual.     It's totally unprecedented.       Sometimes you do and sometimes you don't.     What is the test for when you think your obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed means you'll follow your view about whether it's constitutional or not or you won't follow your view?       So you say we shouldn't be concerned about that part of Chadha because the issue wasn't joined there?       But we should take Lovett as a binding precedent even though the issue wasn't addressed at all?       You can finish your sentence.       Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE       I suppose your -- you agree that Congress could go the other way, right? Congress could pass a new law today that says, we will give Federal benefits.     When we say "marriage" in Federal law, we mean same -- committed same-sex couples as well, and that could apply across the board?     Or do you think that they couldn't do that?       Well, no, my point is it wouldn't -- you don't think it would raise a federalism problem either, do you?       Okay.       So just to be clear, you don't think there is a federalism problem with what Congress has done in DOMA?       Oh, so it would be central to the inquiry if Congress went the other way, too?       I understand that. That's your equal protection argument.     It's not very responsive to my concern that I'm trying to get an answer to.     You don't think federalism concerns come into play at all in this, right?      I know the equal protection argument would be different.       So as soon as one State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of marriage throughout the Federal code had to change? Because there is no doubt that up until that point every time Congress said "marriage" they understood they were acting under the traditional definition of marriage.       So you don't think that when Congress said "marriage" in every one of these provisions that they had in mind same-sex marriages?       So that was the view of the 84 Senators who voted in favor of it and the President who signed it?     They were motivated by animus?       Thank you, General. Ms. Kaplan? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTA A. KAPLAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT WINDSOR       Could I ask you the same question I asked the Solicitor General? Do you think there would be a problem if Congress went the other way, the federalism problem? Obviously, you don't think there's an equal protection problem --   -- but a federalism issue, Congress said, we're going to recognize same-sex couples -- committed same-sex couples -- even if the State doesn't, for purposes of Federal law?       I just am asking whether you think Congress has the power to interfere with the -- to not adopt the State definition, if they're extending benefits.     Do they have that authority?       No, no.     I know that. You're following the lead of the Solicitor General and returning to the Equal Protection Clause every time I ask a federalism question. Is there any problem under federalism principles?       With Congress passing a law saying, we are going to adopt a different definition of marriage than those States that don't recognize same-sex marriage.     We don't care whether you do as a matter of State law, when it comes to Federal benefits, same-sex marriage will be recognized.       Is the --       So 84 Senators -- it's the same question I asked before.     84 Senators based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?       Well, does that mean -- times can blind.     Does that mean they did not base their votes on moral disapproval?       I suppose the sea change has a lot to do with the political force and effectiveness of people representing, supporting your side of the case?       You don't doubt that the lobby supporting the enactment of same sex-marriage laws in different States is politically powerful, do you?       Really?       As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your side of the case.       Well, but you just referred to a sea change in people's understandings and values from 1996, when DOMA was enacted.     And I'm just trying to see where that comes from, if not from the political effectiveness of -- of groups on your side of the case.       I understand that. I am just trying to see how -- where that that moral understanding came from, if not the political effectiveness of a particular group.
12-315 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   So you're saying, if it made a difference in their mind whether to send one officer to his house or a SWAT team somewhere else, that's material, and you lose immunity?   If the difference -- if the difference in the language causes TSA to do anything differently, then you lose immunity?   A different effect -- a different effect on who?   The TSA. So -- but that's what I'm saying. Let's say the TSA person looks at it and says, ah, this is -- you know, if it had been phrased as you say, ah, this is silly, I'm not going to do anything. But he says, well, it looks silly to me, but I'm going to send it to my supervisor. That's a different effect on the listeners' mind, and you say that difference causes the airline to lose immunity.   So am I right in understanding that there be two -- you would view these two scenarios differently? The same historic facts. Somebody calls and said this happened, this happened, this happened. He was acting crazy. And the next one, this happened, this happened, this happened, and he's crazy. Do you think you lose immunity in the latter case, but not the former case?   You would lose in both?   So a layperson -- a layperson who -- you know, just looks at this and said, he's acting crazy, they're not immune from that? If they called TSA and say that, everything is true, I guess you would say up until that characterization.   But they would be the airline would be immune?   No, no. I know. But I'm trying to find out if you think there's a difference between the person's subjective, uneducated evaluation, "He was acting crazy," and a difference between that person saying, "He's crazy."   Well, you're not suggesting it would be a different case if they just said he's unstable, as opposed to he's mentally unstable, are you?   When Justice Kennedy posed the guestion that he was unstable, you said, "mentally unstable." And my point is that that doesn't make any difference to your case, does it?   Okay.   Well, but it affects your belief is different in a context like this. It may not affect your belief, but you may decide, but given what's at stake, I don't think he's mentally unstable just because somebody calls and says that, but I'm going to send it up to my supervisor, make sure he feels the same way. And you tell me that you lose immunity if he says, I don't think he's mentally unstable and -- you know, throws it away, in that -- as opposed to when he says, I don't think he's mentally unstable, but let's see what the boss thinks.

What do you do with the fact that the State authorities did charge it under coercion?       It seems to me you could characterize the right to work as more of a liberty interest than a property interest.       So you draw a distinction between extorting someone not to go to work and extorting him how to do his job once he's at work?

My understanding - my understanding is that here, what's involved, obviously through scientific processes, but we're not talking about process.     Here, what's involved is snipping.     You've got the thing there and you snip - snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there you've got it. The baseball bat is quite different.     You don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a baseball bat.     You have to invent it, if you will.     You don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of the strand, you just have to cut it off.       Okay.     You've got the cDNA.       I still don't understand what -- in what sense it's different than just snipping along -- along the line.       Okay.     So that's a particular -- where you snip.     We're talking about though the patentability of what's left -       -- after you've snipped it.       Well, I don't understand how this is at all like that because there you're obviously combining things and getting something new.     Here you're just snipping, and you don't have anything new, you have something that is a part of something that has existed previous to your intervention.       Sure.
12-399 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rothfeld? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS BIRTH FATHER, ET AL.       Do you think that's correct under the Act?     Where in the Act does it say that you need to consider whether or not the father is a -- would be a good parent?     I thought your reading was that it doesn't matter, all that matters is that he has in his case 3/128ths Cherokee blood.       Could -- could I go back to what you just said about (f)?     You think custody covers someone who has never had custody of the child because it refers to something beyond the accepted definition?       But (f) doesn't say "child custody proceeding."     It says "continued custody of the child."       But not me, right? (Laughter.)       This is not -- (f) is not about terminating parental rights.     It's about what -- I mean, it's about custody, right?       In what proceeding, the adoption proceeding or custody determination?       If -- if you had a tribe, is there at all a threshold before you can call, under the statute, a child an "Indian child"?     3/256ths? And what if the tribe -- what if you had a tribe with a zero percent blood requirement?     They're open for, you know, people who want to apply, who think culturally they're a Cherokee or -- or any number of fundamentally accepted conversions.       I mean, is it - is -- would that child be considered an Indian child, so a father who had renounced any interest in her until he found out about the adoption would have all these rights?       No, no.     That's why I asked it.     It's a different question. (Laughter.)       So return to what is a hypothetical question and not what the statute provides.     Under your argument, a tribe that did not require any blood requirement, but simply enrollment, could be considered an Indian child.       Yes, you have somebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my hypothetical tribe, has a biological child.     That child would be an Indian child and the father would be entitled to the protections you're arguing for.       Well -       I'm just wondering is 3/256ths close -- close to zero?     I mean, that's - that's the question in terms to me, that if you have a definition, is it one drop of blood that triggers all these extraordinary rights?       He was excited, but there is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy and nothing at the time of the birth, right, to support the child or the mother?       So he was excited by it, he just didn't want to take any responsibility. (Laughter.)       You have an extra - you have an extra minute.       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Kneedler?

12-414 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Newman? ORAL ARGUMENT OF VALERIE R. NEWMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       If I could move beyond the particular facts to some of the broader points that the Solicitor General has raised?     If you don't have the requirement of at least some corroboration, then all you have in every case is a completely self-serving assertion, I wouldn't have pled guilty -- you know, if I had known this or I had known that. And everybody will raise that argument. Everybody raises ineffective assistance of counsel anyway, and they will just add onto it this plea assertion.     I mean, shouldn't it be -- the Sixth Circuit really went out of its way saying there is no requirement of corroboration at all.       So you think the Sixth Circuit was wrong in what you are characterizing as dicta?     You think it was wrong to say that and that the other circuits which require something in addition, that that's the rule that we should adopt?       Well, I thought - maybe I'm misremembering, but the Sixth Circuit distanced it itself from the other circuits, didn't it?       Now, you are telling me that all the circuits have always done this.     So the Sixth Circuit at least thinks it's doing something different?       Well, if there is always going to be objective evidence, that's like saying you don't have to have corroboration.       So the Sixth Circuit was wrong when it said, we are doing something different than the other circuits?

12-418 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Dreeben. Ms. Fuentes. ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, how -- I'm not sure that makes much sense.     You're saying if they're relying on the enumerated power with respect to the military, they can do more than if they're relying on Page 43 the enumerated power over interstate commerce?       So in what sense --       Well, in what sense does it then depend on which enumerated power they're invoking?       They say -- they say it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate the military forces.       Well, I'm trying to see why you're saying the enumerated power under the Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent action, but the enumerated power under the Military Clause does not.       I would have thought that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve. But I don't see how it makes a difference which enumerated power you're talking about.       I get to ask the questions.     You don't. (Laughter.)
12-43 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Counsel --       We had a lot of -- your friend had a lot of questions on the different periods -- the initial periods and changing the D value and what that did to the -- that is not an argument that you've made, is it?       Well, but that is -- again, that's not an argument you've made.       Well, the amicus did, but I don't think we should do a better job of getting money from people than the IRS does. (Laughter.)       No, that's a good articulation of the argument you haven't made.       I thought you were saying that that argument was wrong because you looked to the predominant character of the tax and that it's either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not. It wouldn't be an income tax on the vast majority of the companies where it was the same and not on the companies where it was a large value or the other way around.     You look at the predominant characteristic and you decide whether it's a tax or not on that basis.       But there is no difference between what the Commissioner says the regulation means and what it says.       It doesn't seem to move the ball much, one way or the other.       What if you -- go ahead. What if they impose this -- what you would call valuation tax every year, and it was based the same way, it's based on profits that year, saying, we're going to say, we think the value of this company is now this much because they made -- whatever -- $20 million last year.     And so we impose this -- this set tax. The next year, we think its value is this because they made -- you know, 10 million, so we are going to impose this tax.       Based solely -- based solely on the amount of income?       How could -- a property tax calculated that way?     In other words, based on income from the property?       But if they said, we are going to multiply it by a price/earnings ratio.       Based on how much you earned.       Which sounds like income.       Well, the "how much you earned" part sounds like income.
12-462 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Rosenbaum. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA H. ROSENBAUM ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   And that's no clearer than the -- the government's view, and it seems to me to be a particular problem when you're talking about the objectives of the ADA, to say that the rule varies from State to State, particularly since, of course, we're dealing with airlines that go to a lot of different States. I mean, it seems to me that the loosest State, from the point of view of the preemption, is going to set the standard.   Yes. It's a general rule that it depends upon the particular circumstances. That's the same rule, but in its application, it certainly varies from State to State.   I don't think it helps your argument to say that your position promotes the purposes of the ADA because the whole point of that -- of the preemption provision, is that that's for the Federal government to determine, not for different state laws, what promotes the purposes of the ADA.
12-464 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       But none of that goes to his ability to hire his counsel of choice.     I mean, that seems to me to make this case quite different.     It's not that property is more valuable than liberty or anything like that.     It's that the property can be used to hire a lawyer who can keep him out of jail for the next 30 years, so the parallels don't strike me as useful.       I understand the theory.     In reality, it's not terribly -- it's not great insulation from the overweaning power of the government.       I don't see what this case, frankly, has to do with the grand jury at all -- or review of the grand jury determination.     You don't have to put forward, in this hearing, what you put forward before the grand jury at all.     You could put forth different stuff.     You could put forth less of it. Maybe you don't want to show your -- your whole hand.     Maybe the party, on the other side, they don't want to show their whole hand, too, so they don't want to show all this other evidence that's going to prove -- prove their innocence. It's an entirely separate proceeding.     Now, maybe the fact of the grand jury indictment should be given some weight or not, but it's not reviewing a particular determination.     It's the judge making a determination on what he or she has before him at that particular hearing.       No.     It's not, in the sense that, before the grand jury, you say, okay, here, we showed the grand jury these six things, and they said yes.     You look at those six things; there's the probable cause. At this other hearing, you say, I've got - I'm going to show you these two things, and the other side has these three things.     And the judge, at that point, says, well, you don't have enough to restrain the property. It's not reviewing the other determination. It's an entirely separate proceeding.       That's because they didn't have the good lawyers they wanted to hire. (Laughter.)       I'm sorry.     Are you talking about cases in like the Second Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, where you do have these hearings?       I raised this point earlier.     It may be because the government, particularly when it may have tenuous probable cause basis, decides it's not worth it to go through this hearing to seize and retain the assets. And it just seems that the statistics are phony, in the sense that, where the impact of this is going to be is not in reported cases; it's going to be when the U.S. attorney says it's not worth it, it would jeopardize the trial on the merits, and so they don't even go through the process of restraining the assets.       More that the facts, since the funds are traceable, anyway and they'll have an opportunity to get them at the end, even if they don't get their restraining order, makes it not worth it.       You're making it sound like you would lose the whole case.     This, to some extent, is a little bit of a side show.     You want to send the Kaleys to jail, and you want the assets that you think are traceable to it, and that's all well and good.     But it's not like the whole case falls apart depending on whether or not you can restrain the assets or not.       Yes, but they're -       Sure.     But now, you've touched on something that I think is very pertinent.     They are used to pay restitution to the victims.     I mean, the whole point here -- and presumably, it's something that your friends on the other side would raise in one of these hearings, is there are no victims, right?     That's the theory. And maybe it will fall apart, and the judge will say, of course, there are victims, but as I understand it, the hospitals -- you know, gave them to the people; the companies didn't want them back because they would have to give a credit. You know, I'm sure the government has a different view of the facts, but that's a good example. Okay, this is going to be used to pay restitution to the victims.     They come in and say, well, just give me five minutes, Your Honor, you'll see there are no victims. What's wrong with that.

But it would have been so easy.     There -- it's -- it's a set, race, color, religion, sex or national origin.     And why would they leave it out?       Why would they leave "or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a)"?       I know your argument is, well, look, the Court's already said, well, that's -- that's included, but they've got two provisions fairly close to each other, and I don't know, if they're running through the usual list, why they wouldn't have just run through a list as it appeared in (g)(2)(A).       All right.     Thank you, counsel.       Ms. Sherry. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT       Where are they - where are they going to be weeded out?     On summary judgment or on -- after trial?       Just before you do that -       -- because I understood we are talking about what possible reason there could be for drawing this distinction.     It seems to me that the protection against discrimination - race, color, religion, sex -- that sets forth the basic principle of -- of fair and equal treatment. The anti-retaliation provision is more functional.     The way you protect against that discrimination is you make sure people don't retaliate when they complain about it.     Now, that seems, to me, to be an order of -- of hierarchy removed from the basic principle.     So, perhaps, you would have a different standard of causation when you deal with that.       Well, that -- I think that was my point, that they are linked together but they are at different levels.     I mean, the -- you protect against retaliation, so that the protection against race, color, national origin can be vindicated.
12-515 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Well, you don't it -- You don't have a square ruling, so I want to make clear, because both you and the Solicitor General have suggested this as an option: You think it is all right for the State to go in and arrest every employee, management -- you know, labor, who is participating in this casino and subject them to criminal sanctions, civil penalties and an injunction. You have got no problem with that?   You, as a tribe you, as a tribe, would have no objection to that action?   Well, I know, you could suggest different ways, and the State could tell you -- you know, go fly a kite, we are prosecuting these people. And you'd have no objection to that?   Okay. What about Ex Parte Young? Are you willing to waive the tribe's sovereign immunity in an Ex Parte Young action? Because, in your opposition to the complaint in this case, you raised sovereign immunity as an objection to the Ex Parte Young --   Not just are available; that you would not assert sovereign immunity if they brought an Ex Parte Young action.   I don't see how an arbitration works. The Federal government has a very keen interest in whether this is Indian land or not. And the arbitrator is going to decide that in a way that's going to bind anybody?   So ongoing, as far as the tribe and the State is concerned, they proceed from then on as if this is Indian lands, even though the Federal government is saying, no, it's not.   Yes. So the arbitration doesn't get -- so the arbitration doesn't get you anywhere at all.   If we get -- go ahead.   We've talked about this prosecuting the employees. I suppose, if you bring a criminal action against one of the employees, the State would have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this was not Indian lands?   That's not much of a --   That makes it a much more difficult remedy than the typical injunction action.   He might have something you would like to respond to. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the RESPONDENTS   But they are quasi -- quasi-sovereigns, which means --   Dependent sovereigns, which means the -- it is surprising that the scope of their immunity exceeds that of States or foreign sovereigns.   So the -- so the Federal government can certainly take enforcement action against this casino.   The Federal government, the Solicitor of Interior has said these are not Indian lands, the NIGC has adopted that interpretation. The NIGC has said, but we can't do anything because they are not Indian lands, and we work on Indian lands. And then they've referred, as I understand, the matter to the United States Attorney who has, thus far, not done anything, right?   So, basically, as I see it, the Federal government is saying, States, you can't take action against this illegal casino. We're the only ones who can. We agree that it's illegal, but we are not going to do anything.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT   What is the -- you do have good facts on your side. But what if the offense is simply the failure to list a particular asset? Does that justify a departure from the usual rule?   No you know, it's a -- it's a bank account that's held in -- you know, a separate name or it's separate real estate. It's fairly common for debtors to leave off some assets they want to conceal. Is that, as a general rule, sufficient to justify this unusual authority?   Well, then it then it becomes a not very unusual exercise of authority. It becomes pretty common since the concealment of nonexempt assets is a fairly -- I don't want to say it happens all the time -- but it's a fairly common situation.
12-52 +++$+++        Yes.     Thank you, counsel. Mr. Shaughnessy? ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN C. SHAUGHNESSY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       But it seems to me that you can't ignore the fact that part of what tow trucks do is store things.     I mean, it's a necessary and integral part of the motor service, the transportation of property, that they do.     And regulation of the storage will affect the services that they provide.       It's not just like -- it's not just like storing anything else.       Well, it isn't too -- I mean, this is a provision of course in the Federal Aviation Administration Act.     Whatever rule we adopt is going to apply to air transportation as well. And is your position, for example, that things related to a hangar at an airport, that those are not covered by this at all?     It seems to me that there the connection between the transportation and the storage, the storage of the airplane, you can see a little bit more clearly how that would affect what the airplane -- you know, can do.     A lien -- you can't take the airplane out of the hangar because you didn't pay the rent or whatever.       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yelin, welcome. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS S. YELIN, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT       Well, it's -- I asked your friend on the other side the question. Page 41 Storage is part of what tow trucks do.     Maybe in a way that -- you know, cross-country trucks don't.     And it seems to me if you have a local jurisdiction who figures out, well, this is a great way to make a lot of money or -- you know, to give -- or the other way -- you know, you can charge -- charge a lot because we want to keep subsidized tow trucks.     I mean, why isn't that fairly directly related to the service they provide?       Well, but I mean, maybe these, but you can easily imagine that these types of laws would be subject to abuse and would have an Page 45 adverse impact on the towing company and, therefore, on the transportation of property.       Well, now we only -- now we not only have to decide whether this type of law is related to it, but once we say some of those laws might be and some won't be, depending upon the impact in a particular case.       Every law doesn't have to be considered in its application.     If you say you can't speak out on the sidewalk, it doesn't matter what they apply it, you can consider that law absolutely.       Well, why doesn't this one really whack them, though?     It's treble damages and all that. You can answer my question, yes. (Laughter.)
12-536 +++$+++        General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE       That's because they can transfer the funds among themselves and to a particular candidate.     Is -- is the possibility of prohibiting those transfers perhaps a way of protecting against that corruption appearance while, at the same time, allowing an individual to contribute to however many House candidates he wants to contribute to? I mean, the concern is you have somebody who is very interested, say, in environmental regulation, and very interested in gun control.     The current system, the way the anti-aggregation system works, is he's got to choose.     Is he going to express his belief in environmental regulation by donating to more than nine people there?     Or is he going to choose the gun control issue?       What -- what is the framework -- what is the framework for analyzing -- I agree with you on the aggregation, but it has this consequence with respect to limiting how many candidates an individual can support within the limits that Congress has said don't present any danger of corruption? So what is the framework for analyzing that? Give you your argument with respect to the transfers and the appearance there, but it does have that other consequence on something we've recognized as a significant right.     So -       Sure.       But the -- the consequence is -- just to get back to my prior question, the consequence is you are telling somebody who doesn't want to give 3.4 million, but wants to contribute to more than nine House candidates, just up to the maximum, which would be the $5,000 per the double cycle, you are telling him that he can't make that contribution, however modest, certainly within the limits Congress has said does not present the problem of corruption, to a tenth candidate. I appreciate the argument you are making about the 3-point-whatever million-dollar check and the need for the aggregate limits to address that.     I understand that point.     But what do you do with the flip side?     I mean, you can't pretend that that is pursued with no First Amendment cost quite apart from the one that's there. It seems to me a very direct restriction on much smaller contributions that Congress said do not present a problem with corruption.       No, but that wouldn't -- doesn't normally get you very far on the First Amendment.     You could not have a rule that says the -- the Post or the New York Times can only endorse nine candidates -       -- because -- I mean, it's completely content neutral; you don't care who the tenth is, but that -- that limit would not be -       Is there -- is there any way to prevent the concern you have about the 3-point-whatever-it-is million-dollar check without imposing the limit on the person who wants to support ten candidates, rather than one?       Well, all right. But -- so then -       Sure.

MOGILL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       You said your view of the law was -- you know, so well-established -       -- as to be beyond question.     That is the standard under AEDPA, right?       You have to be - you have to be -- you have to be that right to prevail, right?       Could you -- I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       Well, but the Lynch -- the Lynch case was 2 years before the Michigan legislature adopted -       -- the statute that we are dealing with here, right?       And that's where you are putting -- if not all of your eggs, most of your eggs, right?       Well, that's the -- that's the whole case.     The whole -- the whole point is that the law made that moot because the law under Michigan did not specify diminished capacity, and it's a code State, so you only get what they specified. I -       Well, but you'll at least -- well, maybe not.     I mean, would -- would you acknowledge that the force of Lynch was arguably diminished by the fact that Michigan passed a statute that did not mention the diminished capacity defense 2 years after it?       I'm talking about Lynch.       So two -- two dissents is what you're relying on?       Thank you, counsel.
12-562 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Garre. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       You say that -- you say that that's not true because individual partners may respond differently to the partnership determination with respect to basis.       Some of them are going to put in something else, but somebody may put in zero for a number of the reasons that the IRS's counsel suggested.       And now, I suspect that those will be only in rare circumstances, and I guess that's why the D.C. Circuit said, even though the result here may be obvious, it nonetheless depends on the outside basis determination.       And I think what I understand your friend to be saying is it's not just that it's obvious, but it's ineluctable, and therefore, it doesn't depend on the outside partnership determinations. So does your case hinge on the perhaps unusual situations where you have one of these partners having a fit of conscience and decides to put down the real number or has some other adjustment to it?

They said, look, I'm not leaving until I get my money back.    And I'm going to get my money back as soon as the lawyer sends us the receipts or whatever it is.    Is that a different case?      I thought your arguments was basically it does arise where he lives and works because it is in Nevada.    And he still lives and works in Nevada, even if he stays in Georgia and says, I'm not leaving until I get the money.
12-609 +++$+++        Mr.     Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       It's just the fact that the evidence here is based on the defendant's statements.     If you had a physical object, you wouldn't say it's the -- the murder weapon.     You wouldn't say that, if the defendant submits a study about the murder weapon, the ballistics, this and that, you wouldn't say, well, all the government can do is cross-examine the defendant's expert.     You say, no, they get to do their own study. The reality of what makes this different is that here, when you're submitting and preparing psychiatric evidence, it's based on -- the ballistics testing is statements from -- from the defendant, and it seems to me unfair to say the defendant's expert has access to that ballistics evidence, but the State does not.       No.     I understand that.     But it just so happens that the way you do the - the testing on the evidence when you're talking about psychiatric evidence is to ask questions of the defendant.     That's how you do it.     That's the parallel to whatever ballistics tests they do on the -- on the firearm.
12-62 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin? ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       What if -- I'm sorry. Are you finished?       A good -- good advocate. Let's say you had a statute -- not a guideline, a statute -- that said a sentence for a particular offense will be 5 years, but the judge can lower it to 4 years, if he thinks it would be a manifest injustice to sentence to 5 years.     That provision is later repealed. Now, it just says that the sentence should be 5 years.     Does that violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?       No matter how narrow -- no matter how narrow the original grant of discretion is?     In other words, only in the case of manifest injustice or however dramatic you want to limit the available discretion.       How would -- how would a court --       Right.     How would a court go about answering that question?       So it's a statistical evaluation of the kind we were talking about.     You look, and you say, well, it's only once in a blue moon that a judge invokes the manifest injustice provision, so it's not increasing the risk. On the other hand, well, every four out of five judges do, and, therefore, it is an increase.     Is that how you --       You can finish your sentence.
12-682 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenbaum. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. ROSENBAUM ON BEHALF OF THE CANTRELL RESPONDENTS       What if the -- what if the -- the board delegated to the various universities the authority to develop their own admissions programs?       I'm sorry, they did. And then after several years they decided, you know, we don't like the way it's working.     They're adopting too many racial preference programs, we're going to revoke the delegation.       Why is that any - any different?       So if there were a provision in the Michigan Constitution that says the board of regents is authorized to enact these programs, in other words delegated from the people in the Constitution to the board, and then the people change the delegation by saying, no, it's no longer -- we're no longer going to leave that up to the board, we're going to make the decision ourselves in the Constitution, how is that any different?       So I mean, you could say that the whole point of something like the Equal Protection Clause is to take race off the table.     Is it unreasonable for the State to say, look, race is a lightning rod.     We've been told we can have affirmative action programs that do not take race into account. Socioeconomic diversity, elimination of alumnae preferences, all of these things.     It is very expensive. Whenever we have a racial classification, we're immediately sued.     So why don't we say we want you to do everything you can without having racial preferences. Now, if the litigation determines that we're required to have racial preferences, this statute has an exception and -- and allows that.     But starting out, we want to take race off the table and try to achieve diversity without racial preferences.       Yes.       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Driver? ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANTA DRIVER ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION TO DEFEND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RESPONDENTS       To what extent -- to what extent does your argument depend -- I thought both Hunter and Seattle speak in these terms -- that the policies that are more difficult to enact are beneficial for the minority group?       To what extent does your argument depend upon the assumption that the programs that you say are now more difficult to enact are beneficial to the minority group?       Well, why do you -       Right.     What if the question of whether it's a benefit to the minority group is more open to debate, whether it's through the mismatch theory that Taylor and Sander I guess have adopted, or other theories?     Do we have to assume in your favor that these definitely are beneficial to particular minority groups?       There may be a difference between popularity and benefit.     In other words, you want us to assume that the programs are beneficial to a minority group?
12-696 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Laycock. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS      And atheists.      Who is going to make this determination?    Is it -- is it an ex ante determination?    You have to review the proposed prayer?      Well, I'll repeat mine.    It was:    Who was supposed to make these determinations?    Is there supposed to be an officer of the town council that will review?    Do prayers have to be reviewed for his approval in advance?      So there is an official in the town council that is to instruct clergy about what kind of prayer they can say?      What exactly - since you are adopting the coercion test, what exactly is coercive in this environment?    Having to sit and listen to the prayer?      They are asked to participate, and -- but not in any tangible way.    They say:    Well, I'm not going to participate, and everybody's just sitting there.      Well, just to be clear, are you talking about what would be satisfactory to the Second Circuit or satisfactory to you?    Because you don't accept the Second Circuit's approach.      We've already excluded the atheists, right?      We've already separated out, I thought, in our jurisprudence, children and adults.      Well, you do accept the fact that children may be subject to subtle coercion in a way that adults are not, right?      Justice Sotomayor.

MILLETT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Ms. Millett, is there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC allowed Louisiana to do was wrong.       Yes, I know.     I'm assuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong. Page 41       You've got a great deal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going to implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act reads the way you say it does. Page 44       It's not just different forms.     You'd have different voter rolls then, Page 48 right, depending on which form?       No?       I would have thought since you allow -- contemplate a State form that has different requirements than the Federal form, you would then end up with two different voter rolls.       Some people that registered under the State form, some people that registered under the Federal form.       Yes, but it doesn't work the other way.       You can satisfy the Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list.       Please.       Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Srinivasan? ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN, FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       As -- as Louisiana has done.

12-729 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Ms. Carroll. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE M.A. CARROLL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       So you're pushing this start to the statute of limitations period, and your answer to the problems is:     Well, don't worry.     If it ever turns into something that's going to be enforced, we won't enforce it, or it won't be enforceable without a judicial determination about equitable estoppel and all these other things that are very difficult to apply.       Well, but there's no -- there's no employer who is going to have a plan put together and say, well, I'm not going to do this unless the statute of limitations for claims runs from the proof of loss.     And if you tell me it's got to run from the exhaustion of remedies, I'm just not going to give a benefit plan.     That's an implausible scenario.       Well, it's hard to see what you mean by the exceeding rarity.     I suspect there are more than nine cases where people are looking at the running of the statute of limitations and they're saying, well, I've got to sue if I don't get this and when do I have to hire a lawyer.     And the last thing you want in this process is to get lawyers involved at the claim procedure.     And they say, well, there's only 10 months left, I'd better hire a lawyer, you know, and instead of the informal resolution, you've suddenly got lawyers involved.     Why isn't that a legitimate concern? On the other hand, if you wait until the claim is exhausted, you may -- you may not need the lawyer at all.     But if you don't know when that period is going to run, you'd better get one early -- sooner rather than later.       Well, she was very prudent.       I mean, she didn't know when it was going to run, you'd better get somebody in there right away.     The typical lay person who's got a claim for $9,000 in disability benefits or whatever, you know, may not know.     Better get a lawyer to tell her. It just seems to me that you keep it as an informal resolution -- inexpensive resolution process if you tell somebody look, you don't have to worry about getting a lawyer until we tell you whether we're going to deny your claims or not.       Well, that's my point.     I'm not talking about the need to go to litigation.     I think there are probably more than 9 people who had to hire lawyers before they even had a decision.       Well, and it's probably a claimant that doesn't have all that much experience in the legal system and doesn't know how long does it take, you know, to get a complaint ready and -- I don't know.     It just seems to me that the problem of a statute of limitations that runs before the claim even accrues requires people to worry about their legal rights in a way that -- the simple rule about when your benefits are denied, that's when the period starts running.       Did I -       Did I understand - did I understand you earlier to say we have not had a case where we have overridden plan terms in ERISA plans?       Well, simply ignore. I mean, is there any in which we have overridden plan terms?       No.       Thank you, counsel.
12-751 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Mann. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   That's what he's supposed to do. And I think that what every Court of Appeals has recognized is that that is by definition prudent, because that is the settlor's objective with one exception. If everything is going, you know, south and the company's collapsing, well, then he does have the obligation to do something. So I don't understand how you keep -- can say that he has breached a fiduciary duty of prudence when the people investing in this ought to know what they're going to get is the company's stock.   Well, what is exactly the duty of prudence? Presumably, you buy -- you invest the funds in the company's stock, whether it's going up or going down, right? If you have the funds, all you can do is invest them. The stock is down half a point or whatever. You still buy it, right?   Well, what's the answer to my guestion?   No, no. I didn't ask a guestion about the duty of loyalty.   I asked a guestion of whether or not the trustee is imprudent because he buys the stock because it's gone down -- you know, gone down 10 percent.   Well, can we talk concretely instead of just saying, well, they've got to do what a prudent fiduciary can do? Are they allowed to take into account the impact of a decision to stop buying on the beneficiaries? The stock is going down, if the trustee stops buying, that's going to cause a drop in the value of the shares and that's going to hurt the beneficiaries. So what does he do? Does he say, I shouldn't buy any more because I think it's going to go down some more? Or should he say, I should keep buying because otherwise all of the holdings, and this is all they are invested in, their holdings are going to go down?   I asked for an answer to the guestion. And I -- it doesn't -- it's not going to help me to have this mantra as opposed to --   The status of the trustee, whether it's an interested party or a disinterested fiduciary, is disclosed to the beneficiaries, I take it, at the outset? They can decide that they don't want to invest in that particular fund and there are nine other options because of that potential conflict?   If they wanted -- they got four percent matching funds if they were in that fund?   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kneedler. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS   Well, what exactly, concrete terms, what do you do as the trustee? You have this information, inside information that says that the stock is overvalued. Do you sell? In which case the beneficiaries' holdings go way down and they sue you, or do you not sell? In which case when the information comes out, the beneficiaries sue you because their value goes down. What are you supposed to do?
12-7515 +++$+++       Mr. Horwich. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      So one little -- one little grain of heroin that you discover is in the body, and that person's going away for whatever it is, 20 years?      If you wanted to incorporate in the statute your friend's understanding of but-for cause, what word would you use that would be better than "results"?      Well, I know.    But you want -- you want a word that's going to be readily understandable.      Mr. Horwich, just if I could get back, that is the instruction on proximate cause.      What about the but-for cause?      Just to get back to it, you were reading from the proximate cause instruction.    They've got -- the very next instruction says:    You have to find that he died as a result of using the heroin distributed by the defendant.    So I think it's a little unfair to suggest that they were willing to go with the same concept of cause that you were proposing.      The problem with your hypothetical, it's the sort of thing where there's no way that a doctor could say three people beat the guy up, which one threw the fatal punch.    But here we have a situation where the experts could tell you:    Yes, the heroin alone would have killed him.    Or, as in this case, I can't tell you the heroin alone would have killed him.      But if you can't put -- but my point is that they would not be able to tell you in any case, where here they can tell you in every case whether it's clear that the heroin caused the death or not.      Right.    But this statute does not say if you die from taking drugs, then the person who gave you drugs, who gave you any kind of drug is responsible.    It says the heroin has to result, death has to result from the heroin.      What about you give the guy a heroin and he drives away, but as a result of using it he's driving under the influence, has an accident and is killed?    Is that -- does his death result from the heroin in that case?

It's okay.       I'm sorry. I'm just -       -- about 30 seconds behind you. Nobody contends that you bought anything other than non-covered assets?

12-794 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Komp. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE E. KOMP, APPOINTED BY THIS COURT, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, but then the reservation certainly suggests that, at the time the instruction was requested, it wasn't beyond any fair-minded dispute, which is the standard. No one's talked about the standard yet. The standard is that -- which you're complaining about -- that the error has to be so well understood and comprehended in existing law to be beyond any possibility of fair-minded disagreement. And it seems to me if, shortly after the instruction was requested, the court itself said, oh, that's different, we're not talking about that, it certainly suggests that it was a subject of fair-minded disagreement.   Not only that. Your position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond fair-minded disagreement.   Right.   Well, but you're saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable disagreement, to say that, when the court says lack of remorse in a sentencing guideline case, it still thinks there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a selection case such as this.   I thought your friend told us that future dangerousness was an eligibility factor, rather than a mere selection criteria.   I'm sorry. It left in -- Estelle left intact what?   So -- so your argument is when Mitchell said -- whether it applies to lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the sentencing guidelines, that's a separate question. We don't have any view on it. But at the same time, the Court said well, of course, it applies in -- in the other -- other context.   But that's perfectly clear. I mean, if you were arguing the other way, you would say, well, the question is whether it's clearly if there's a clear difference between lack of remorse in the sentencing guideline case and lack of remorse in a capital case, and everybody knew that, so that when Mitchell just said it doesn't apply to lack of remorse in the sentencing guidelines, nobody would think that meant that there was an open issue on the capital context.   You can finish your --
12-815 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Lynch? ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. LYNCH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS      So -- but I mean, is there a different category, some of the normal regulatory interests are important and other regulatory interests are not?    I mean, it seems to me the line that Younger drew, or that I thought it was drawing, between criminal and civil has been eroded to a considerable extent.    But your friend analogized that in other cases, for want of a better word, to -- they're sort of quasi-criminal or at least touching upon the process as opposed to a particular proceeding. I mean, do you think that the abstention applies in the case of every regulatory proceeding?      Well, how do you -- how do you tell which -      I'm sorry, it's going to what?      Oh.      Well, don't all - it's sort of like the important State interests.    I assume the State's not doing anything unless they think it's important.    And any type of administrative proceeding, remedial or otherwise, has to a have some bite to it.    There has to be something that is going happen to you if you don't do what they tell you to do. So in that sense, I mean, almost every administrative proceeding is coercive.      Well, my point is it doesn't seem like much of a limiting test, if you can say any time -- sort of any time anything bad can happen to you as a result of an administrative proceeding, that's coercive.    It doesn't seem like a serious constraint on the application of Younger.      Why is -- I'm sorry. I was just going to say why is that?    Presumably, the State is resolving that dispute pursuant to some State law or State regulation, State policy.    I don't know why the -- the State interest is unimportant simply because it's the resolution of a private dispute.
12-820 +++$+++    Ms. Moskowitz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREN A. MOSKOWITZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, the whether or not the child is settled in a particular case is certainly going to be a significant consideration in the custody determination, isn't it?   The problem is you're each -- you're each using the child as the tool in the objective that you have in representing the parents. On the one side is the allegation of ineguitable conduct in concealment. On the other side is the interest in settlement. That's a dispute between the two parents, and the child is being used as -- as -- I don't know what -- you know, a tool in implementing those conflicting considerations. And to the extent that the Convention was designed to deter that kind of kidnapping, it adopted a -- a fairly strict rule. And you're each trying to say, oh, the rule doesn't mean what it means because, don't worry, we'll take those considerations into account in addressing custody; and on the other side, well, don't worry because there's not that much difference between 12 and 13. So how are we supposed to decide between those two conflicting considerations of the parents while maintaining the paramount concern, certainly not the exclusive one, but the significant one, in the interest of the child.   But that cuts against you in some respects. You say there is such a big difference, and therefore, it is very important that the kidnapping parent do the best he or she can to conceal the child's presence, so they get beyond 13 and into 12.   Those are us from the Midwest think it's actually easier to hide a child in New York. (Laughter.)   Briefly, please.   Thank you, counsel.   Ms. O'Connell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT   Justice Scalia.   I would think it would be very unusual for a family court in that situation not to go ahead with the custody proceeding before it because it would think the child is settled. Now, do I send the child back. So that they can do the custody proceeding in England, or just go ahead and do it here? Don't you think most family court judges would say, let's just go ahead and do it here?   What kind of reasons -- what kind of reasons would there -- would there be?   To send the child back?   So you would visit on the child the behavior of the parent?   Justice Scalia?
12-842 +++$+++    Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Olson? ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   What exactly does that have to do with the issues before this case?   It seems to me that that context is totally irrelevant. You have a question, it doesn't matter what the basis of the underlying judgement is. The question is one of discovery.   I'm sorry. Finish --   Well, but doesn't that seem pretty extraordinary? You just said you can get a discovery about a plane that says Argentine Air Force on the side of it. That seems, to me, to go to the heart of what the Deputy Solicitor General was talking about. That's pretty intrusive at a sovereign level to say you can find out how many jet fighters Argentina happens to have.   Just before you get over there, I thought your position was that yes, you can ask for discovery related to, you know, the Argentine Air Force.
12-8561 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   But doesn't -- doesn't the individual at least cause some harm without regard to the harm caused by the others?   Of course, yes. Now, why isn't it the case -- why can't the -- why can't Amy have an expert that comes in and testifies, as a result of their experience, that the psychological harm caused by knowing that those images are available to others, have been viewed by someone else, will require, on average, whatever, a certain amount of counseling for a certain amount of time? So that the one individual is responsible for that harm, regardless of what else happens. Now, he may say, well, it's kind of unfair to stick me with that, but that's a different question than the aggregate causation issue that you're addressing. If you have expert testimony, and there will be expert testimony on the other side, that says it normally requires counseling for someone, when they find out, without regard to anything else, that an individual has viewed this, why doesn't that require -- or at least allow assessment of the -- the whole amount?   My -- I'm sorry. My hypothetical is not aggregate causation. It is that this individual caused this harm.   How does that -- I'm sorry.   How does that work for -- go ahead.   Can I ask you one -- just one moment. How does that work for the first person?   All right. (Laughter.)   How do you tell your model, how does it work if it turns out that the damages are a million dollars, as opposed to $3.4 million? Is it still $1,200 per offender?   So you would expect -- you would expect the defendant in a case where the restitution sought is a million dollars to pay 50 percent of what he would pay if the damages were $2 million.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cassell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. CASSELL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT AMY UNKNOWN   Well, but responsible for those as a proximate result of the offense.   The only offense shown here in this case is the possession of the two pictures. So how -- how can all of those amounts be the result of the possession of two pictures?   Well, you understand the statutory principle, that it says, "any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense," which suggests that the prior losses are also limited as a proximate result of the offense.   Why would Why would it make sense to say that he's liable for lost income, whether or not it's a proximate result, but when it comes to other losses suffered by the victim, they have to be the proximate result?   Can I get back to -- your point was that all of the (A) through (E) is limited, and you don't need -- well, it's not. One of the losses that can be gained -- recovered is lost income. Now, if you take away proximate cause, the argument can be, well, I had to undergo counseling in a particular period, so I wasn't able to get a master's degree in this. Because I didn't get a master's degree, I wasn't able to get a better-paying job, and therefore, I'm entitled to the income from the better-paying job that I would have gotten if I had a master's degree, if I didn't have to take the counseling. Now, unless you limit that by proximate cause, it's entirely open-ended. It's not confined, as you said.   No, no. I'm talking about proximate causation.   No, it's not a simple case. You said, rhetorical exaggeration, every word in the statute leads to that. But the key words don't. The key words are "proximate result of the offense." And it's difficult to argue that the entire amount is a proximate result of the offense of two pictures.   You can please answer.
12-872 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Theobald. ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. THEOBALD, III, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, we said the exact opposite in Wilkie in footnote 4.     I mean, you can say it's only a footnote, but it is what we said.       Well, your brother -       -- who just sat down, explained that the Seventh Circuit's ruling didn't consider the issue that you're -- you're talking about now.       Was that the -- was that the first one or the second one?       So you don't want - you don't want to -- you don't want to give it up, which makes sense.     I mean, you've got a client.     It depends on what we do, right?     I mean, depending on what our ruling is, it may be advantageous to you to argue, as you alleged in your complaint, that he's an employee.       It seems to me that, since you asked for the ruling on the merits and got it, we ought to be able to review it, to determine whether it's right or wrong.     And to the extent there's a factual issue that would persist in the case, if it goes back on qualified immunity, you and the parties can reposition themselves on that. I mean, it is an issue that was apparently close enough for one district court to say, yes, the other district court, on looking at it again, to say no. The deck will be reshuffled depending on how we rule. And as I see you standing there, I don't see you willing to concede for -- for the future that he's not an employee.       Well, then I assume -- if you're saying the qualified immunity ruling should not be reviewed because this person was not an employee, but instead covered by GERA, right?     Is that what -       Well, they didn't address GERA in the preclusion ruling, right?     So presumably, they get another -- they get a chance on an interlocutory appeal.     The whole thing is -- qualified immunity is supposed to protect them from trial. And if you say the GERA issue wasn't - wasn't considered, even though the Seventh Circuit's ruling was sweeping and didn't distinguish, well, they should have a chance to assert qualified immunity under that ground, I would think.       In the Seventh Circuit, even though they -- you had that reference to him being exempt, the Seventh Circuit basically said it didn't make a difference, right?     Whether he was covered as -- as an employee or not covered or covered under GERA or anything else, under their analysis, it doesn't make a difference.

12-895 +++$+++       Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      That's a very fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's in great jeopardy of -- of being caught himself and convicted.    Of course he wants the crime to succeed because he doesn't want the people to be there and being pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you know, who was in on -- who was in on this with you? So if you're -- if you're being paid for a crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you want it to succeed.      He has a stake in it.    If the guy is caught, the police are going to say, where did you get the gun?    He may turn him in or not, but it's certainly a danger, a danger that wouldn't be there if the crime succeeded.      Well, he proposed - he proposed a different instruction that departed from the instruction that was given on that point.      Two -- two wrongs don't make a right.      What -- what's the point of charging him with possession of the gun and possession of the bullets in the gun?    It would seem to me that the proof would be pretty much the same.      Well, I guess, then, the question is:    What's the point of charging him with possession of the bullets if you're not charging him with possession of the gun?      You would -      You would never - if you got a call from the U.S. -- assistant U.S. attorney in the field said, this is the instruction I'm going to use, you would tell him, no, don't do that.      No, I know you have arguments about failure to object and harmless error. But on the substance of it, you think the instruction - you would never counsel someone to give that instruction.      I -- I don't see how "make the crime succeed" helps you because you would say the crime that he has to help make succeed is the underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm.

HARRINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   You would agree that --   You would -- you would -- you would agree that a different rule applies if there is some unreasonable delay in disposing of the property?   And what do you do in the case of some dramatic development between the return of the house as opposed to the -- the property and its -- and its sale?   Well, you know, something is discovered with respect to the property that nobody knew about. It's -- suddenly, it's a hazardous chemical zone and the property is -- is worthless. While when it was returned -- not returned; I don't mean to prejudge the case.   When the bank got it, it was worth $200,000, but all of a sudden it's, you know, Love Canal or something, and it's worth nothing.   Well, no. But my point is, is it the value you could sell it for before this discovery of an extraordinary condition, or is it the value afterward?   Well, what if they get -- they get the house and as soon as they get it, there are ten offers at $500,000 or more, and the amount of the restitution is, you know, $300,000 or whatever. But the bank says, you know, I think the market is going to go even higher, so I'm not going to sell it right away, I'm going to wait, not an unreasonable length of time, but I'm going to wait. And then the market craters. I mean, is the same rule then, that they only get what they were able to sell it for?   I know banks like to get rid of property as soon as possible, but, you know, they make decisions at some point, let's wait before we sell this. Is that commercially reasonable?
12-929 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Allensworth? ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. ALLENSWORTH ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT       Well, that's kind of a big thing, isn't it?     I mean, that's what the whole - (Laughter.)       It's a significant factor.     And -- and the problem, the difference, all things don't lead to the same place.     1404 says to the district court, look at a hodge-podge of things, including the interest of justice, and -- and figure it out and -- you know, maybe they will give the contract some weight or maybe they won't, and if they do, it's not clear how you weigh the contract against the interest of justice.     It gives a broad discretion.     It says they may transfer. is an entirely different animal.     It says you shall dismiss or -- or transfer.     It's sort of a -- you know, you have the safety valve to transfer, and I don't know why you -- you so cavalierly dismiss, oh, it's in the contract, of course, but we've got more witnesses.       Well, that couldn't have come as a surprise.       No, but the reason for these clauses -- the enforceability of these clauses is critically important to a lot of modern commerce. If you -- I don't know what the details are here, but a lot of times your company -- and they are doing business now all across the country, and you say, I don't want to do business all across the country if I'm going to get dragged into different courts, who knows where, with different -- where the juries are different, I want to do business around the country, so long as, if I am going to be sued, it's right here.     So I'm only going to do business with people who are willing to say, if I have a problem, I will sue you right here. That's -- that's critically important to modern -- modern commerce.     And the idea, well, you're going to let a court say, well, but there are a few more witnesses here -- you know, it's convenient to them and all that, that -- that seems to be throwing a significant wrench into the process.       Well, what facts are -- what facts are -- in the normal case, what facts are going to be pertinent?     I mean, you've got the contract there.     I mean, I suppose you can always say, we entered under duress and all that, but that wouldn't seem to me to be typical in the normal commercial case in which these provisions are critically important. What facts are going to be there?       But what type - what type of materiality?       Well, the venue provision -- I mean, if they go to the trouble of putting a venue selection -- forum selection provision in, I would say it seems pretty material.

12-9490 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Laurence. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY M.K. LAURENCE ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   What  what if the call is -- you know, I'm driving, this guy just drove by me, I looked over, he didn't have his seatbelt on. I mean, can the police pull that guy over?   Well yeah, there are laws against driving without a seatbelt because that protects people's lives.   I've never understood -- what good do those -- you know, let's say that I'm at a party, I don't like somebody there. I see they have a couple of drinks. I know what kind of car he drives. I know the -- I can look at the license plate. I call -- you know, ten minutes later. I know where he goes driving home. There's this car. It's a white whatever. It's got this license plate. It's swerving all over the road.   Whether he is or not, the police go up, they pull him over and find out, yeah -- you know, he fails the breathalyzer, and I get my revenge.   I was just going to say my point is it need not necessarily be a personal observation of the person operating the car. It may be prior knowledge. And I gather one of the issues we're concerned about is people using this to -- you know, exact revenge or -- or do something else having nothing to do with whether or not the person is violating the law on the highway.   Thank you, counsel. No, no. We're going to hear from Ms. Kovner first. Ms. Kovner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS   Well, where does that -- I think this is the question Justice Kagan asked earlier -- how does the nature of the offense affect the reasonableness of the suspicion?   I mean, in either case, you have -- let's say the seatbelt and the swerving driver. It's the same witness. He said, still, it's a white Ford. The reasonableness of the suspicion would seem, to me, to be totally divorced from what it's about.   Well, that's just not true. It's -- it's an acquaintance, I know what kind of car he drives, I know where he's going. I didn't see anything on the road, but I call the police and say, oh, there's this -- you know, white Ford swerving all over the road.   No, I'm talking about the concern that you want to have the police pull over people that you don't like, where you know somebody's got something bad in the car, and you don't like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the fact that the police don't have to observe anything, and yet, you can still get them to pull over this person.   What about the danger from the police side? In other words, they know -- or they suspect that the guy driving the white car has a lot of marijuana in the trunk. They have no basis for pulling him over. And they say, well, guess what, we got an anonymous tip that he was driving erratically, so we pulled him over.   What protection is there against that?

ORAL ARGUMENTS OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT       Can I ask you just a little bit about that record?     Do you know how many submissions there were for preclearance to the Attorney General in 2005?       3700.     Do you know how many objections the Attorney General lodged?       One, so one out of .       Just to get the -- do you know which State has the worst ratio of white voter turnout to African American voter turnout?       Massachusetts.     Do you know what has the best, where African American turnout actually exceeds white turnout?     Mississippi.       Which State has the greatest disparity in registration between white and African American?       Massachusetts. Third is Mississippi, where again the African American registration rate is higher than the white registration rate.       Justice Alito.       General, is it -- is it the government's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?       Well, once you said it is not, and you don't know the answer to it.       A need to do what?       And not -- and not impose it on everyone else?       I don't -- I don't understand the distinction between facial and as-applied when you are talking about a formula.     As applied to Shelby County, they are covered because of the formula, so they're challenging the formula as applied to them. And we've heard some discussion.     I'm not even sure what your position is on the formula.     Is the formula congruent and proportional today, or do you have this reverse engineering argument?       To -- to the problem or -- or was the formula congruent and proportional to the remedy?       Well -- I'm sorry.       You have an extra 5 minutes.       Thank you, General.       Mr. Adegbile? ORAL ARGUMENT BY DEBO P. ADEGBILE ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS BOBBY PIERSON, ET AL.       Do you agree with the reverse engineering argument that the United States has made today?       I guess -- I guess the question is whether or not that disparity is sufficient to justify the differential treatment under Section 5.     Once you take away the formula, if you think it has to be reverse engineered and -- and not simply justified on its own, then it seems to me you have a much harder test to justify the differential treatment under Section 5.       Well, we also said congruent and proportional.       Well, the Fifteenth Amendment is limited to intentional discrimination, and, of course, the preclearance requirement is not so limited, right?       Have there been episodes, egregious episodes of the kind you are talking about in States that are not covered?       Well, then it doesn't seem to help you make the point that the differential between covered and noncovered continues to be justified.
12-98 +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Browning? ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       Well, but it's worse than that.     He does care because the smaller amount means that the victim is going to actually get to keep more and that's all the victim's lawyer is concerned about, and that's fine with the tortfeasor's lawyer because otherwise he would have to pay more.       Sorry to --       It's the same point. (Laughter.)       What about fair?       Exactly what?       I was going to say, how do we know what's fair and appropriate?     You come in -- let's say you have $20,000 in medical expenses and a claim for pain and suffering.     And they come in and they recover a million dollars, right? So what's appropriate in that case?     The other side will say, well, we settled on a million dollars, pain and suffering was really 20 million and we came down to a million.     So what's fair allocation in the case of the medical expenses?     It seems to be an entitled -- entirely artificial judgment.     To the extent it's not, it depends on the views of the two parties negotiating and I thought we established that that is entirely subject to manipulation.       It's -- it's a little better than that, but go ahead and answer. (Laughter.)       You've said several times that the way you do this is based on the judge's experience and so on with -- with the cases.     And I think what your -- your friend on the other side is saying is that's pretty much what's going on here except over time -- I mean, would it be all right if over time the judge says, well, typically, sometimes it's 25 percent, sometimes it's 35 percent, over time, it's sort of 33 percent.     And so we're going to have that as an absolute rule so that we don't have to go through these proceedings every time just to make sure that it's 30 percent rather than 33 percent. What's -- I guess it's Justice Kagan's question -- what's wrong with the bright-line rule here?       Well, we're dealing with a North Carolina statute.     Don't they get deference along the same lines?       Well, it can't be very clear because CMS took the opposite position before this case, right?       Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders? ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS       Is that a reasonable -- this is the Federal district court?       So it's not a State Procedure?       What if -- what if the other -- the parties I guess are coming in and saying, well, that's not how juries work.     They don't care that this measure of damages is particularly calculable.     They come to a general view.     You've got medical expenses, you've got pain and suffering.     They make a judgment about that.     Would that be a good argument to make?       So how would it take it into account?     You said, well, because the medical expenses are readily calculable, we assume that that's what the jury meant first, and then the other stuff is extra so the State can get it.     But maybe sometimes they just come to a -- a total figure and they don't care how it's allocated.     You say, well, that's an argument they can make. Well, what's a judge supposed to do in a particular case?       So this is a real, significant increase in the burden on the State under the Medicaid program.     You're saying yes, you can try to recover recovery from third-party tortfeasors, but if you do that you've got to set up this apparatus where everybody can come in and you've got to prove what the allocation was and all that. So -- I mean some -- 34 States haven't done that, right?       Well, yes, for your purposes.     But I'm interested in -- in my purposes.     And I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's a significant financial burden on the State -- if they're going to go about trying to recover this money, that they've got to provide some apparatus, administrative, judicial, whatever, to make a calculation that I still don't understand what it's addressed to. And -- and not only that, but even if you do know what it's addressed to, you just take into account all these things and come up with an equitable.

FELDMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   I thought the procedure was, regardless of who prevails, it's not piecemeal appeals. I mean, they often combine the two in the court of appeals for consideration.   Well, even if it's -- if they don't need -- you don't need Rule 58, at least the practice I was familiar with, you file for attorneys' fees, they calculate it -- unless the appellate court is moving with surprising speed, the first appeal is still pending by the time the district court rules on the attorneys' fees.
13-115 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Wilker. ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. WILKER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Mr. Wilker, let's say something happens back in the patio area where you -- you're the head of the Secret Service detail. You've got to evacuate the President right away. Do you go through the anti-Bush crowd or through the pro-Bush crowd? You've got to decide right now quickly. I'm serious. You have to make a split-second decision. Which way do you go?   No, no. They are both the same. That was one of your propositions, that there is no way to distinguish there. It's too late. You've taken too long to decide. It's a serious point.   You've got to decide like that.   No. I know. But if we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a security justification, we have to consider all of the possible situations. So again, if you had to decide right now do you go through the anti-Bush crowd or the pro-Bush crowd? Guns are going off, explosions. Which way do you go?   Really?   Well, but with respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a consideration, then you have to say when there is an emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a problem if we go through the pro-Bush demonstrators or the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face, implausible.   So then you think there -- well, there may be situations in which viewpoint alone may be a security consideration.   Well, Iqbal says a little bit more than that, not that you just have to allege facts. In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page 681, the Court goes on to consider the factual allegations in the complaint to determine if they plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say, but given more likely explanations, they do not plausibly establish this purpose. So based on just your complaint, we have to determine whether there are more likely explanations. And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at the front of the alleyway, it's a six-foot wooden fence. Can we -- we certainly can look at those in deciding not simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but whether it's more plausible than those other justifications.   That's what we said in --   Just to make sure, we're talking about the 15 minutes between --   Between when and when?   Right.   And the first -- they first cleared the alley, right?   And then the movement that you're concerned about.   Now, doesn't it make sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the alley, right, because that's right up against where he's standing. So you take care of that. You clear the alley. Then after you have more time to assess the situation, you say, okay, now we've got to get these people who are at the foot of the alley, we've got to move them. In other words, they had to act not in an emergency situation, but reasonably quickly and they did it step by step.   But here's where we get back to Iqbal. It doesn't have to be so compelling. It simply has to be more likely, is the quote from Iqbal on 681, and it has to be an obvious alternative explanation. And that's enough, no matter what you've alleged.   So discovery is your answer. And of course it is. You've got allegations. You're going to go to trial. The first thing you're going to do is file interrogatories, you're going to file requests for admission, you're going to file discovery requests to the Secret Service. And the district court's going to have to allow some of that, isn't he, if he's allowed your allegations to go forward?   The first thing you'd want -- I say the first thing you'd want to know is whether this was a departure from established policy. So the first question in -- if I were drafting interrogatories would be, what is your policy with respect to moving demonstrators at a presidential event? What do you do? And I can see the Secret Service saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it public because there are people out there who want to kill the President, and if you go through your discovery and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is what we do, that gives people a -- a guideline for how to break through the security arrangements.   I suppose you would then seek discovery with respect to those 12 other episodes, because you're saying those are viewpoint discrimination, how can you decide until you know the facts of those?   The same range of things that we talked about earlier: Interrogatories, requests for production, discovery, with respect, not just to your case, but to the 12 others?

What does that have to do with my question about a bomb?   I'm sorry. Justice Kagan has a question.   So but that's a significant concession on your part, isn't it, because the smartphones carry a lot of information that would not have been the sort of thing police could look at before. GPS tracking information, the police could never have gotten that before. So you are saying that is protected?   The GPS would see if he did, in fact, turn right at the thing or had gone somewhere else.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben? ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R.

MURPHY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Are you ready --   Are you prepared to represent to us that if they do the exact same thing the next election that they did in the last one, that you will not take action against them?   I guess it was in the case of COAST; the problem is other people are going to be intimidated from helping them engage in their political speech. What was it, a billboard? The billboard company said --   -- I'm not going to let you put your sign up on my billboard, I might be liable. So, I mean, they may have a certain fortitude and proceeding based on all the reasons that you've given, but they need third parties to help carry out their message and there is no reason to think those third parties have any commitment to their political message at all and the slightest whiff of, oh, this is going to be legal trouble, they say, forget about it.   Well, no, but a defamation action, people sue everybody all the time. No one's going to take that seriously. In fact, it's probably going to redound to the benefit of SBA and COAST to say the congressman is, you know, bringing a defamation action. It highlights it, but it's another thing to have the State involved making a determination that there's probable cause that you lied.   Well, how many of those do you know were mooted out by the election?   In other words, the proceedings are going on and people's speech is being chilled and it's back and forth, then the election is over, and people say, oh, forget about it.   500. You gave us some answers about how many of the 500 resulted in criminal prosecutions. And all I want to know is how many of the 500 proceedings were mooted out by the fact that the election took place.   You don't even want -- you don't even want the district court to decide it. You want to go through a certification process that will bring in a whole another court system.

13-339 +++$+++    Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Korzen. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. KORZEN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Well, and the whole purpose of a statute of repose is -- is very different. That's to give you a drop, you know, completely finish date, so whatever was -- was latent or not latent, it's over with. It's a different purpose than a statute of limitations.   Well, why would you -- why would these four States have two of them then? I mean, if they are doing the same thing, why have two different ones?   Well, it depends whether they have a discovery rule or not, whether it's a period when an action may be brought or whether it's a period after which an action may not be brought. And the whole purpose of this was to require a discovery rule. And once you require a discovery rule, the statute of repose has completely independent meaning, complete -- serves a completely independent office.   Well, but the purpose of the statute of repose is not to preserve latent causes of action. It's quite the opposite. It's to put an end to in particular latent causes of action that haven't been brought.   Well, wait. On the one hand I thought you just told us they were respectful of the States' concerns. And now you say they completely abolished repose periods.   Well, I'm sorry. Not the State law with respect to repose.   But you said it wanted to have polluters on the hook, but they didn't even take -- if the State did not have any basis of recovery, this did nothing about that at all. It did not -- it did not require States to adopt particular remedies or extend the remedies to cover this. If they didn't have remedies for this type of action, the act -- the provisions we're talking about now did nothing about that at all.   Is there any sign that that's happening? I mean, it seems to me that these are, as you know, rare and have been rare for some time, right? I mean -- do you really expect States to start suddenly enacting statutes of repose?
13-354 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT   That's a statement that is inconsistent with RFRA, isn't it? The whole point of RFRA is that Congress wanted to provide exceptions for the religious views of particular -- including proprietors, individuals.   Yeah. But the wisdom you cited is the idea that you don't have imposed, on the basis of religious beliefs, exemptions or -- or limitations. And it seems to me that was the whole point of RFRA, to tell the courts that that is exactly what you should do unless the exception satisfies the strict scrutiny test.   Well, that's his argument for distinguishing it. But there are others, including the fact that it is more you avoid all of the problems with what to do if it's a -- you know, there's a 51 percent ownership of the shareholders, if you simply say that it's in this type of Chapter S Corporation that is closely held. Whether it applies in the other situations is -- is a question that we'll have to await another case when a large publicly-traded corporation comes in and says, we have religious principles, the sort of situation, I don't think, is going to happen.   Well, that's a question of State corporate law. It's not a question of who can bring an action under RFRA. Could I just raise -- eight courts of appeals, every court of appeal to have looked at the situation have held that corporations can bring racial discrimination claims as corporations. Now, does the government have a position on whether corporations have a race?   So that -- so that a corporation does have a race for purposes of discrimination laws.   So those -- those cases involve construction of the term "person"?   So the person -- the corporation can bring as a person a claim of racial discrimination.   What about the grandfathered plans?   Well, just before you -- so one thing I'd like you to address, the dispute arose with Mr. Clement about how long they were going to be in effect. Can you make a representation to us about how long the grandfathering is going to be in effect?   Can you give me an approximate time, if not a precise one?   Well, if you can't tell us, and I don't fault you for not being able to tell us, when the grandfathering is going to end, shouldn't we assume in our analysis that it is current and, as far as we can tell, not going to end?   Well, isn't that because you're talking about building ramps and things like that?   Those were decisions -- those were decisions that Congress made, right?   Well, the grandfathering is not a decision that Congress made, is it?   Well, but that of course is an issue that's being hotly litigated right now, right? Whether the employees can get the coverage when you're talking about the religious organizations.   But you're relying -- you're relying on it to make your point with respect to the accommodation, and then you're criticizing your friend for relying on the same thing in making his points.   Well, if Congress feels as strongly about this as you suggest, they can always pass an exemption, an exception to RFRA, which they have done on other occasions. And they haven't done it here.   Well, we've already discussed that there is no case holding that they can't, right?   I'm sorry, I lost track of that. There is no law on the books that does what?   Well, flesh it out a little more. What -- there is no law on the books that does what?   Isn't that what we are talking about in terms of their religious beliefs? One of the religious beliefs is that they have to pay for these four methods of contraception that they believe provide abortions. I thought that's what we had before us.
13-369 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Harris. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   So it was fair, as I suggested earlier, nobody agrees with that formulation; right?   Is it part of an answer to Justice Breyer's question that the diagram shows them equally spaced or is that not relevant?   What -- what about the case that he postulated, an abstract one, where you have two perfectly reasonable constructions. What -- what happens then?   Could I -- could I just go back to my -- you know, the two reasonable. Is there a range? The Chevron -- the Chevron analogy again comes to mind. Let's say one is more reasonable than the other, but they're both reasonable. What type of range do you have before you say that the patent is invalid?   You mean the answer?   Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Gannon. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS   But you say something like "appreciably better," that's a term that may acquire meaning over time. Just like reasonableness, we get a good sense of what it means. Is it your sense that the Federal Circuit has been applying its test in this case? I mean, not in this case but in a series of cases that is -- it is close to appreciably better or is it something quite different?   Yeah, nobody likes those phrases --   Are you finished with your answer?   Can you do it in a sentence?
13-461 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT BY MR. DAVID C FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   But is there any reason you need 10,000 of them? Can't you put just -- if your model is correct, can't you just put your antenna up and then do it? I mean, there's no technological reason for you to have 10,000 dime-sized antenna, other than to get around the copyright laws.   Yeah, but it's not -- it's not. You give them space that's available when they call in. They don't have -- this is my little dime thing, and this is my copy that's going to be here. They're there, and when they want something, you provide the service of giving them that. They don't have a dedicated antenna in Brooklyn.   Just to make sure I've got -- there's no reason it's a user-specific copy, is it? They're making 10,000 copies. It'd be much easier for you if you'd just have to make one copy and everybody could get a copy.   Surely, you can make a program where you have just one copy and starting it at different times. You don't need every viewer to have his own copy.   That's just saying your copy is different from my copy.   -- whether you can give me any technological reason, apart from compliance with a particular legal regime, for your technological mind.
13-483 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. General Strange. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. LUTHER J. STRANGE, III 0 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BURROW   But what about the Martinez case? I mean, Morris talks about it in a way that suggests that it's guite different. And it seems closer to the Petitioner's situation than Morris.   So you think if every other circuit has come out the other way and you have what -- well, let's take the dictum. There is an Eleventh Circuit case that, it's dictum. Are the employees supposed to -- are they protected by following that, or do they have to follow the consensus in the other circuits?   Thank you, General. Mr. Waggoner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. WAGGONER 0 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FRANKS   I  I still don't understand or didn't understand what it is you're saying. If he testifies, and you don't -- you want to keep the corruption secret. You know, you don't want to reveal it and he testifies truthfully and reveals it. Can he be disciplined for that?   Well, what is he -- what is he supposed to do? I mean, he gets a subpoena, and the -- the other side or somebody, this independent counsel, says, you know, what's going on? What do you know about, you know, from your job responsibilities? What happened or did you -- is this person taking money? Is this person showing up? What's he supposed to do? He says, gosh, if I -- if I answer, I'm going to lose my job or could, and if I don't or answer falsely -- the Fifth Amendment protects him from incriminating himself. It doesn't protect the department he works for from being incriminated.   But you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it.   When you say it's protected, does that -- you mean under the -- it gualifies under the first step in Garcetti. It doesn't mean that he can't be disciplined under the Pickering analysis that follows that.   Right. But even if it is, you could say that it is -- when you say it's protected, you mean that just it gets to the Pickering analysis, not that -- not that the employee is --   Really? Well, let's say it's -- his job is to investigate corruption in the agency. And he writes a letter saying: Here's all -- I have these, you know, facts; here's all this corruption in the agency, and -- and he writes it to the -- a letter to the editor. Surely he can be disciplined for that. I mean, let's say the -- his superiors were not ready to call off the investigation at that point.   Well, I thought it was just because the facts came from your employment. If you're conducting an investigation and you find out that, you know, so-and-so is taking a bribe because that's your job, I don't know that you have a First Amendment right to go out and say that, when, for example, your superior would say, oh, we are about to set up a sting operation, we are going to get the -- the goods on her. And you say, well, I think I'd rather write a letter to the editor saying that she -- she has been caught, you know, taking a bribe.

134 ORIG +++$+++                     Mr. Frederick. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT                  So we here decide -- under your view the case comes down to whether or not use of the wharf for a liquified natural gas terminal is a traditional riparian right.                  So let's say Delaware, it's not liquified natural, gas but it's, you know, bulk shipments.       Is that a traditional riparian right that Delaware could not prohibit or is it something that it could prohibit?                  No.      So what we want to know it whether or not there are constraints in the Compact.                  A permit -- a permit for the project or a permit for the wharf?                  Well, then what does the 1905 Compact give New Jersey?                    What's left under your reading of Virginia v. Maryland?                     I understood that case to say -- I mean it's the same thing, the Maryland boundary goes to the low-water mark on the Virginia shore.    Yet this Court held that that did not include police power to prevent the particular riparian use at issue there.                  That's the case here as well.   There's no doubt that New Jersey under the Compact has the right to grant riparian rights, including wharfing out, that go beyond the low-water mark.                    As I understand our decision in Virginia v.         Maryland it's that withdrawing of the water is a carve out of Maryland's police power that would otherwise apply.                   Right.   Now why isn't there a limited carve out on the New Jersey side of similar riparian rights?             In other words, New Jersey has the authority to authorize wharfing out and to that extent, it's a carve out of Delaware's police power.                   How does that work? What if New Jersey says to the wharf owners you must dredge around your wharf because we think it's -- you know, silt is depositing, and Delaware says you may not dredge around your wharf because we think it's going to disturb the oysters?      Who -- how do you concur jurisdiction work in that case?                   Well, it's something they do have the authority to regulate.
137, Orig. +++$+++        Thank you, counsel. Mr. Michael. ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER KENNETH MICHAEL ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT WYOMING       Just to follow up on Justice Kennedy's point, because I think it's important: So you were reading -- when it says "is depleted," you think all you have to show is that it's less than when you started, and once that is shown, it is depleted. Then you're saying, but we can deplete as much as we want?       Yes.       And you don't care how much?     You're saying, well, this is a beneficial use because it depletes some of the water, it takes some away, and once we have gotten over that hurdle, all bets are off and we can deplete as much as we want.       Well, I guess to get back to the point, wouldn't the normal word be "divert"?       Counsel, just before you sit down, what makes you think we've deferred the remedy question?     It's presented.     It's been briefed. don't know why you think we've deferred it.     Whether or I not Montana has to take care of intrastate uses - that's what I understand the remedy question to be.     You briefed it.       Well, thank you. Thank you, counsel.       Mr. Jay, maybe you can help clarify something.     The -- the second question presented, which involves what Montana has to do before they -- that's still before us, right? ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING DEFENDANTS       I know you want us -- you don't want us to reach it, but it's still before us.       Well, I always thought in addition that's kind of the way appropriation law works in the west, right?     I mean, the person who gets it, gets it. (Laughter.)       Well, I mean, I don't mean -- I mean, isn't that the difference between eastern water law and western water law?     In the east, you try to allocate everything fairly so everyone is treated fairly, and I thought in the west, for reasons of efficiency, it's first come, first served.       You keep saying everybody gets the same beneficial use they had prior to 1950, but -- even though that may mean they can't do it. In other words, they may have a right to get 50 cubic whatever for irrigation, but there may not be any water there for them to use it because of the increased efficiencies upstream.
138, Orig. +++$+++                   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bartolomucci. ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. CHRISTOPHER BARTOLOMUCCI ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENORS                  This is our original jurisdiction.     I regard the Special Master as more akin to a law clerk than a district judge.              We don't defer to somebody who's an aide that we have assigned to help us gather things here.     I think on legal questions of intervention we have to decide de novo.                Counsel, let me tell you what I'm very worried about.           This is our original jurisdiction, a delicate jurisdiction that allows us to resolve disputes between sovereign States.            And I look out and I see all sorts of private parties intervening in a way that would give them party status.            And I think that's compromising what our original jurisdiction is supposed to be about.                 You're -- all of the intervenors, prospective intervenors, they want to make sure North Carolina doesn't lose water, right?                 Well, their -- well, they want to reduce South Carolina's claim on the water.                Well -- to the extent they have differing interests, why aren't those interests fully satisfied by amicus participation?                Shape the record, but intervention status would give you the right to appeal, right?                Right, and appeal the normal case.                Well, that's my question.   If we grant intervention in this type of case and there is no reason it would be three -- I mean, in the next case, it could be 20 different intervenors, and they are filing exceptions every other week that we have to review and adjudicate because they are not bound by whether or not the State that is on their side wants to file exceptions.                And North Carolina, as a sovereign State, can represent the interests of its constituents as it sees fit. You and your fellow prospective intervenors just have to do what citizens do all the time, which is convince North Carolina, one, and you can help them, to get as much water as they can; and, two, when they get it or if they lose it, whatever they are left it, to give it to you, rather than the other parties.                Well, then that s  - then I just wonder why you are here in an original action. What you are saying is they have all sorts of different interests, and it just -- they get to skip district court.     They get to skip the court of appeals. They can just come right in here, as if they were a State, and participate in the case.               You don t --                 Well, what's special about it?   I mean, let's say I own a little farm on the banks of the Catawba, and I take water out to -- so the cows have something to drink, why does Charlotte get a special status just because they take a lot? I'm affected by how much water runs through there.                 Well, and that relief will affect how much water is available for me to draw out and use on my farm.            That's a compelling interest. I -- you know, in times of drought, this water barely trickles by, and, if it's cut back, the farm is going to go down.       It seems to me that, when you say they have a special interest, you are just saying they have got a big interest.                Well, let's say the interest -- the dispute is really in effect between company ABC in North Carolina and company XYZ in South Carolina.    I mean, do we -- we would not accept an original action if they sued each other, right?                Do we let them just use the States as, you know, a faade to get into this Court and have their dispute adjudicated here?                Wouldn t it   would it be surprising if the Special Master recommended that all the issue that she was going to address was the relative equitable apportionment between North Carolina and South Carolina, and even though South Carolina wanted an injunction directed against the City of Charlotte, that's up to North Carolina?              North Carolina can divvy up its water however it wants.                Thank you, Counsel.                Mr. Browning. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT                Maryland v. Louisiana involved a specific tax on specific companies, and they were allowed to intervene.                This is not that. This is a question of how the equitable apportionment of the water is going to be, and North Carolina can do with the water whatever it will. It strikes me as very different than Maryland v. Louisiana.                 As -- as the allocation would in this case, presumably.                   Counsel, my basic concern is that -- and I will let you finish if there is more to the answer.     I'm sorry. Private parties are going to hijack our original jurisdiction, and it was highlighted for me when I read your motion, the motion of private parties for divided argument.      Your proposal was that they be divided 10, 10, and 10.       You didn't even want to be here. As they view the case and as you view the case, it's got so little to do with the State that the State didn't even want to come here and argue the case.                  You thought their participation here before this Court on a question in original jurisdiction was more important than yours, and you represent the State.                  Why can't you represent them?               They are your constituents.     You are the State.           You are coming here directly, not even going to district court, and you seem to be ceding your sovereignty over to them.                What is -- what's the interest of North Carolina?                 You are standing there telling me why Duke has an interest.               What s North Carolina's interest?                 So oppose their intervention.                Well, if it's an attack on -- if it's an attack on Charlotte, I would expect the State to be standing there protecting it and not feel that they can't do that without Charlotte, itself, coming into the case.
11-398 +++$+++        Mr. Katsas. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       The whole point -- the whole point of the suit is to prevent the collection of penalties.       Well, prevent the collection of taxes.     But the idea that the mandate is something separate from whether you want to call it a penalty or tax just doesn't seem to make much sense.       It's a command.     A mandate is a command.       Now, if there's nothing behind the command -- it's sort of, well, what happens if you don't follow the mandate, and the answer is nothing -- it seems very artificial to separate the punishment from the crime.       Well, why would you have a requirement that is completely toothless?     Pay -- you know, buy insurance or else.     Or else what?     Or else nothing.       Yes.       Thank you, Mr. Katsas.
11-400 +++$+++        Thank you, Mr. Clement. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS       But none of those have addressed the coercion question.       So, do you think it would be all right for the Federal Government to say, same program:     States, you can take this or you can leave it, but if you don't take it, you lose every last dollar of Federal funding for every program?       But there's no coercion question at all?       No, I know we don't have that here.     How does germaneness get -- get to coercion?       That's germaneness; there's no --       So, it fails because it's not germane.     But you're saying it would not fail because it was coercive?       No, no.     I know it's -- I know it's different here.     I'm just trying to understand if you accept the fact or regard it as true that there is a coercion limit, or that once the Federal Government -- once you're taking Federal Government money, the Federal Government money -- can take it back, and that doesn't affect the voluntariness of your choice? Because it does seem like a serious problem. We're assuming, under the Spending Clause the Federal Government cannot do this.     Under the Constitution it cannot do this.     But if it gets the State to agree to it, well then it can. And the concern is, if you can say, if you don't agree to this you lose all your money, whether that's really saying the -- the limitation in the Constitution is -- is largely meaningless.       No, no, I know.     I'm just -- I know this -- I don't know if I'll grant it to you or not, but let's assume it's not this case. Do you recognize any limitation on that concern?       Could you give me some assurance?     We heard the question about whether or not the Secretary would use this authority to the extent available.     Are there circumstances where you are willing to say that that would not be permissible?     I'm thinking of the Arizona letter, for example.     I mean, if I had the authority and I was in that position, I would use it all the time.     You might -- you want some little change made?     Well, guess what, I can take away all your money if you don't make it.     I win. Every time, it seems that that would be the case. So, why shouldn't we be concerned about the extent of authority that the government is exercising simply because they could do something less?     We have to analyze the case on the assumption that that power will be exercised, don't we?       No, I appreciate that.     I appreciate that, but I guess --       What about the Arizona letter we just heard about today?       It's been used to threaten --       Of course, no State is going say, okay, go ahead, make my day, take it away. They're going to -- they're going to give in.       Well, but that's just saying that when, you know, the analogy that has been used, the gun to your head, "your money or your life," you say, well, there's no evidence that anyone has ever been shot.       Well, it's because you have to give up your wallet.     You don't have a choice.       And you cannot -- you cannot represent that the Secretary has never said: And if you don't do it, we're going to take away all the funds. They cite the Arizona example.     I suspect there are others, because that is the leverage.       I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.       Wait a second.     It's not -- it's not coercion -- well, I guess that's what the case is.     It's not coercion --       -- to say I'm going to take away all your funds, no matter how minor the infringement?       No, what the --       Im sorry.     Go ahead.       Yes, but the question is not -- obviously, the States are interested in the same objective, and they have a disagreement, or they have budget realities that they have to deal with. And States say, well, we're going to cut by 10 percent what we reimburse this for or that for, and the Federal Government says, well, you can't. And no one is suggesting that people want to cut health care, but they have different views about how to implement policy in this area. And the concern is that the Secretary has the total and complete say because the Secretary has the authority under this provision to say you lose everything.     No one has suggested in the normal course that will happen, but so long as the Federal Government has that power, it seems to be a significant intrusion on the sovereign interests of the State. Now, I'm not -- it may be something they gave up many decades ago when they decided to live off Federal funds, but I don't think you can deny that it's a significant authority that we're giving the Federal Government to say you can take away everything if the States don't buy into the next program.       If it's such a good deal --       -- why do you care? If it's such a good deal, why do you need the club?       It's a good deal, take it.     We're not going to -- if you don't take it, you're just hurting yourself.       We're not going to --       You have another minutes  at least.      Well, what --      Obviously, the Federal Government isn't bound to that.    And what if, after the 90 percent, they say, well, now -- from now on, for the States -- we're going to pay 70 percent? What happens then?    Where does that extra money come from?      There's no -- they can just bail out as soon -- whenever the government reduces the amount of the percentage --       -- that it's willing to pay, the States can say that's -- that's --      Oh.      Well, the Secretary has the discretion.    We're talking about something else. We're talking about fiscal realities and whether or not the Federal Government is going to say we need to lower our contribution to Medicaid and leave it up to the States because we want the people to be mad at the States when they have to have all these budget cuts to keep it up, and not at the Federal Government.      I know, but you've been emphasizing that the Federal Government is going to pay 90 percent of this, 90 percent of this.    And it's not something you can take to the bank, because the next day or the next fiscal year, they can decide we're going to pay a lot less, and you, States, are still on the hook, because you don't -- you say it's not an easy choice.    We can say -- ask whether it's coercion. You're not going to be able to bail out of Medicaid. You just have to pay more because we're going to pay less.       You mentioned the -- the Dole case.    Now, what was the threat in that case, raise your drinking age to 21 or what?       Do you remember the percentage?      Yes.    It's a pretty small amount.    That's really apples and oranges when you're talking about lose all of your Medicaid funds or lose -- I thought it was 5, but 7 -- 7 percent of your highway funds.       What was the threat in the stimulus bill?    What would the State lose?      Would anything be taken away, or would it just lose the opportunity to get the money?

Is that your -- is that your position now, that only declared wars are covered?   Was there such an authorization in the Korean War?   No, no. I mean at the time.   I don't think there was, right?   I'm trying to get at the guestion of the breadth of your position. As I -- as I understand it, you're now saying "at war" doesn't necessarily have to have a declared war.   So if -- so if the current version were effect -- were in effect in 1950, the Korean War would not be covered, because there wasn't a declared war? And my understanding is there wasn't a specific authorization for the use of forces.
126, Orig. +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE   Well, we're dealing here with an agreement between States. And it seems to me particularly important that they have some idea about what they're agreeing to based on our -- our precedent. And particularly since the special master, according to your position, has such broad discretion. It can be zero, it can be 40 -- 20 million, whatever the maximum is here. I'm not sure that the States bargain for that exposure.   Maybe for one sentence.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cookson. ORAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID D. COOKSON ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANTS   You agree, don't you, that you couldn't -- the special master couldn't have revised the formula if it had been part of the compact itself?   Why is that?   I do think, though, it is still, the FSS is an agreement between two sovereigns, and I think, putting aside what contract principles may provide as a general matter, that the idea of a special master or this Court changing the nature of that agreement is a pretty radical one.   What about the general rule that the specific controls the general? You have the general statement here, okay, we're not going to count imported water, but then you have a very specific calculation about how you're going to achieve that result. So why doesn't that control?   But do I understand your answer to be that disgorgement serves at least an additional function beyond the injunction, sort of an unjust enrichment element? You've got to disgorge your profit in a typical contract case?

And the many other courts of appeals that have addressed the guestion have distinguished what they're doing, saying, you know, we're not going to follow Yard-Man. We're going to apply normal principles of contract interpretation.   Is it a traditional principle of contract interpretation that if you're dealing with something as big a deal as health benefits for life, you might expect that to be addressed -- addressed more specifically?   That's the general principle of what custom or practice in the industry or something like that, which I guess -- I guess that's an ordinary principle of contract interpretation that could be applied.   Well, what about the arbitration context of Litton? I mean, the idea is, well, of course, it doesn't expire because you might have disputes, particularly disputes going in connection with the expiration. So the idea in Litton, that the ( arbitration reguirements continue, really can't be applied outside that context.
13-1019 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   And what -- I'm sorry. Continue. No, I'm sorry.   But what if you have -- you sent a letter that says a representative of this office will be in contact with you to begin the conciliation process. What if the employer says, nobody contacted me; it never happened. Can you get judicial review of that claim?   No. Is it their obligation to say that or is it their obligation to do that?   And they say here your document is signed by, you know, John Rowe. What if they say, I'm sorry, it's just not true, he's lying? We got nothing, nobody ever called us.   No, no, no. You're making it too easy on yourself, I'm talking about the document that says, we will be in contact with you. Right?   They said nobody contacted me.   Is, in my case, judicial review of that question?   Nobody contacted me; they've got a letter saying they'll contact me, nobody ever contacted me.   That's just assuming you're always right.   I mean, I don't understand why you can't have a court at least say, okay, there's a direct conflict. You say you're supposed to --   -- consume -- and he says it never got off the ground, and you can have --   -- Mr. Rowe file an affidavit and he can file an affidavit and --   You're saying if the agency -- the agency couldn't possibly have violated the law? They wouldn't say we have attempted to -- we will contact you, and then not contacted you?   No, it's not a question of what he's arguing for, it's a question of what you are arguing for. You are arguing that there is no judicial review, full stop. And I'm trying to pose a question where it seems to me that it would be utterly unreasonable for you to say you don't get judicial review of that basic question. I am very troubled by the idea that the government can do something and we can't even look at whether they've complied with the law. I'm not terribly troubled by the idea that the scope of our judicial review is limited. And I just wanted you to tell me which it is, is it that there's no authority for a court to review government action alleged to be in violation of law, or is it that the scope of judicial review for various reasons is sharply circumscribed?   What's extraordinary -- what's extraordinary is that counsel for the other side files an affidavit saying it never happened, I know you've got this letter, but we normally don't take the government's say-so when it comes to a dispute about whether -- whether something happened.   So he can say -- say, okay, here's the affidavit, we never got it. We checked our mailroom --   Nothing ever came in. We checked our phone logs, nobody ever called.   So trust you?   Just trust you?   The other side is challenging with whatever evidence it has. Maybe it's voluminous -- affidavits, records -- and you say, trust us. Here's a letter saying we did it. That's the end of the case.   But there are incentives on most people to tell the truth most of the time, but that doesn't mean that's the end of it.   You said a moment ago that employees have no incentive to conciliate. Why is that?   You're kind of assuming bad faith on their part.   We're supposed to assume complete good faith on the Government's part and bad faith on this employer's part.   All this stuff is in footnotes.   All this stuff is in footnotes, that's where all the important stuff is.   Why does it -- in terms of additionally saying, yes, we called them, how can you conciliate -- this question has been asked; I don't know that we've gotten an answer -- without telling them what you want? I want -- we think there's a class; we think it's this many; we think their damages claims are, you know, 15 million. What do you think about that? You don't have to -- then that's the end of it. You don't have to say, we'll take ten, or anything else. They need to know at least what you want.   You want to go -- you want to go to -- Congress wanted you to try to conciliate.   So to say that it's a good thing to get to the merits it seems to me is not -- doesn't take account of what Congress said, which is, before you go to the merits, try to conciliate.
13-1032 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Domenico. 0 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT   Well, so let's say the law says not only do you have to notify the people at the point of sale on the internet, but it must be in inch-high type so they're sure to see it. Is that okay? Because that makes it -- impedes the collection. Because where, presumably, they can't just put it in the tiniest little type at the bottom of the page.   Well, I mean, you -- you can make light of it if you like, but they're more likely to notice it if it's there glaring them in the face as opposed to a little footnote at the bottom along with the all the other --   And that restrains the collection of the tax?   No, it doesn't prohibit you from doing that at all.   Well, yes, it prohibits you from doing what you want to do but the whole question is whether you can do it. It doesn't prohibit you -- the relationship between the State and the taxpayer is between, you know, John Q. Public and the State. And John Q. Public owes this money and the way you get it from him is the same way you get other taxes that are due from him or you -- you can. You just want to have a more efficient way. But it doesn't interfere with that relationship.
13-1034 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   What -- what if the State law covers controlled substances entirely different from the Federal law? Maybe they figure the feds can take care of that list; we're just going to have a law with these. Does the State law relate to controlled substances?   Wait, what was the answer? If you have it -- (Laughter.)   A couple of sentences ago you said that a sock, when it's used in connection with the drug activity, is sufficiently related to the Federal Controlled Substances Law. What about a gun? Those are often used in connection with drug activity. So is a law concerning gun possession or gun control or whatever, a State law that relates to the Federal Controlled Substances Law?   Well, yes. But if a statute addresses socks, it does.   It was addressing socks when used in connection with drug activity. I'm talking about guns when used in connection with drug activity.   Well, I would have thought the opposite inference. If it's not such a big deal that the State is willing to let him cop a plea to drug paraphernalia, why should that be the basis for deportation under Federal law?   Well, but, I mean, the only -- it's because you give "relating to" such a broad construction that you get the -- what I think is the unusual situation that I talked about, which is that the State thinks it's a very minor offense and yet it can become so significant that the person's deported.

He wasn't suggesting that they would go back and prosecute people who didn't happen to read the regulation but were acting in compliance with it. I guess we can ask him. But, I mean, do you think that's what the government is going to do?   How -- it may not be ( a bad idea to run away from Paralyzed Veterans. I mean, how is it -- how is it at all consistent with Vermont Yankee?
13-1074 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Schnapper. 3 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 4 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   But -- but not with respect to governmental statutes. I mean, that was a guestion of first impression in Irwin.   What did the re what did the recodification do?   Well, but that language -- that language comes from decisions of this Court, exactly. But interpreting the precise language that was put into this act in the same context is the Tucker Act. They were addressing a problem under the Tucker Act, they used that language. And whatever criticism you want to direct to the prior decisions of the Court, they have issued -- they had issued rulings on those when the Congress was looking at the FTCA.   Well, but that's a -- a principle that obviously doesn't cut across the board. In private actions in State court, for example, you do not have to give the administrative agency notice within two years, there are all sorts of things that don't have a particular carveout that don't apply --   No, no.   No, no. You're misunderstanding my point. In other words, just because the law says the United States will be liable to the same extent as a private party, it doesn't mean that all the rules -- I mean in State court -- it doesn't mean that all the rules that apply in -- that you interpret them the same way across the board. There is no reguirement that you give a two-years notice in the typical State court action. But under your theory, well, there ought to be -- do you understand where I'm headed?   And you think in every other --   And you think in every other respect, the procedure under the Federal action is the same as under the State action?   And it goes -- it goes to liability, right? That's the word that's used? Liability?   They're not procedures. I mean, the procedures are different, obviously.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez, you have four minutes remaining. 5 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
13-1075 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Rosenkranz. ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 0 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, if I could just pause there, I mean, obviously I'll go back and reread Bowles. But in Bowles they said the money should be returned because it offended principles of natural justice and eguity.   It doesn't sound like something in the statute.   Well, I don't think it can be regarded as such a sea change because the basic principle is you're looking to legislative intent. And he said, the -- the late Chief, that the realistic assessment of legislative intent is likely to be found based on the presumption. Of course, you know, subject to rebuttal. So that doesn't seem to me to be -- the whole point is we think this is how best define legislative intent, and that I thought has always been the rule.   But, I mean, that was not a legislative intent. The view was not that we think the presumption of legislative intent is -- is no eguitable tolling.

13-1174 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS   Well, that would seem to be very efficient. It would save her the difficulty of reconsidering it if the Second Circuit rules one way or another. It seems to me that the efficiency arguments in these cases, you know, they can go either way and probably do go either way depending upon the nature of the case. It would be very efficient, would save her the time to reconsider it, if she had a ruling from the Second Circuit.   Okay. I thought you were making the other point. So the claims that she's looking at really are not affected by the Gelboim claims.   Then what problem is it to appeal?   Then what's the problem with going ahead with the Gelboim appeal?   Well, there's efficiencies -- there's efficiency to the system and you have arguments about that, but there's also fairness to the parties. I mean, how many years are these people, whose case is done as far as the District Court is concerned, supposed to sit around and wait for the big fish to resolve their cases?   That just kind of begs the question whether this is piecemeal or not for these people.
13-1175 +++$+++    Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT BY THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS   No, no -- sorry.   It allows him the opportunity, while the policeman is getting a subpoena, to fill in the name of the person in what is otherwise a blank space.   Oh, I thought you said that if he serves a subpoena, the other person can demand judicial -- pre-enforcement judicial review.   So the police officer has to go somewhere to get the judicial review with whoever the hotel owner sends.   Okay. They go somewhere.   Okay. During that time, doesn't the hotel clerk take his pen and say, I didn't register this guy in room 2, I'm going to get in trouble, and he fills in whatever is left to be filled in.   Have we used that phrase before?   Tranquility.   We talk about privacy and all that, but I'm not sure that the Fourth Amendment should be expanded to protect the sense of tranquility.   Do -- I think there's some rule -- at least they do it, I mean, in hotels, they have these notices posted all over about where the first emergency exit is and all that.   Could police come in and check to make sure the hotel has those posted --   -- without any type of a warrant?   Well, I don't know -- is the back of a hotel room door -- I mean, is that a private place?   No, no, I'm talking about every hotel room --   -- has one of those   Can they go and say, look, you know, this is a very important thing to make sure people don't die in a big fire, we're going to make sure you've got them. Check -- let me go look in room 12 where nobody is.   99.4 percent jurisdictions, does that include -- are you comparing the little hamlet in Indiana with Los Angeles or New York?

13-1314 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEES   So you want the legislature to pass a law that's not enforceable --   -- and suggest they don't have standing to challenge what the referendum has done in this case until they go through that process?   Which Lujan?   Well, don't they just have to, under that theory, just allege that they plan to exercise what had, up to this point, been their normal authority to engage in the redistricting?   I suspect the fact that they're litigating it implies that they have some interest in doing that.   But I don't understand how 2a (c) even applies. It's meant to apply when the State has not, under its law, redistricted. Here, there's no doubt the State has redistricted under its law. The question is whether the law is valid.   Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman. ORAL ARGUMENT BY SETH P. WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES   Doesn't your -- why doesn't your interpretation make the words "by the ! legislature thereof" entirely superfluous? In other words, why didn't they just say that the rules would be prescribed by each State?   Because any way   I'm sorry.   Well, but I would have thought -- I understood your argument to be that as long as it's an exercise of legislative power, that it's satisfied. And if you have, for example, a governor doing it, it presumably would be pursuant to a delegation, either from the people or from the legislature. But either way, nothing happens until there's an exercise of lawmaking power by the State. So it should have been sufficient for the drafters of the Constitution to simply say it should be prescribed by each State, whether they do it by referendum, whether they do it by initiative, whether they do it by what is commonly understood to be the legislature, whether they do it by committee, whatever. It's up to the State. And then saying "by the legislature" seems, as I said, totally superfluous.   You've -- you've said "the Court in Yates." It was a plurality? Was it, or am I -- am I --   No, I know, but

It was not a hard guestion.   How is a housing authority supposed to -- if you have a claim of disparate impact, how is a housing authority supposed to cure the alleged problem?   Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You have made a showing of disparate impact, that the impact and adverse conseguences for a particular race. What is the housing authority supposed to do at that point?   Is there --   Is there a way to avoid a disparate-impact conseguence without taking race into account in carrying out the governmental activity? It seems to me that if the objection is that there aren't a sufficient number of minorities in a particular project, you have to look at the race until you get whatever you regard as the right target.   Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT   Well, one concern -- one concern about disparate impact is that it's very difficult to decide what impact is -- is good and bad. Take two proposals. One is a proposal to build new housing in a low income area, it would benefit primary -- primarily minorities; new housing, good thing. The other proposal is to build housing in a more affluent area. It would help promote integration of housing; also a good thing. Which one gets credit for under -- trying to decide the impact? The one that is revitalizing a low-income area or the one that is integrating a high-income area?   No, no. But which -- which counts? I mean, which benefits -- you're trying to see if there's a disparate impact on minorities.   If you give the proposal to the low-income housing in the affluent neighborhood, that certainly benefits integration. If you give the proposal to -- fund the proposal in the low-income area, that certainly helps housing opportunities there.   Good.   Well, with respect, I don't think that's responsive. You say you look at which provision is having the disparate impact, but I still don't understand which is the disparate impact.   In other words, is it the provision that causes more proposals to go to low-income housing in the affluent area? Or is it the provision that causes more -- approval of more proposals in the low-income area? You've got to know what you're shooting at before you can tell if you've missed.   I'm sorry, I -- and I'll just ask it for the last time and then let you get on.   You're saying you need the justification, but for what? Which is the bad thing to do, not promote better housing in the low-income area or not promote housing integration?   You say you look at what's causing the bad effect, but what's the bad effect?   I thought the question was, though, I mean, the -- it's not a developer, it's the Department of Housing and Community Affairs, and I thought the challenge went to where they were -- been -- where they were supporting development --   -- not the developer, but -- but --   It was a coincidence.   So just -- I'm sorry. So Just so I can understand, because, again, I don't know what you're shooting for. Two different communities, okay? They have these tax credits, whatever to give out. One place, they give it to the housing in the affluent neighborhood; the other, they give it to the house in the low-income neighborhood. They're both sued for disparate impact. In the one, they say, oh, no, no, this is good because we're promoting integration so the impact on minorities is not a problem. And the other says, no, this is good because we're revitalizing low-income neighborhoods and that helps the minorities. They both win?   Sure.
13-1402 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Haddad. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. HADDAD ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT   But to get to your constitutional claim, explain to me the difference between the marital basis in this case and, say, a parental basis. I mean, if the individual here was a child, would the parent in the United States have the same rights as the spouse?   Okay. So it's spouses. It's parents. I suppose it's children as well, right? If the parent is -- is the one who's being denied access, a child in the United States to be able to get --   Brother -- a brother and sister?   But it --   But -- but it can take a long time, depending upon the nature of the preference, for somebody to get to the front of line. I mean, under some preferences, it's 20 years after you apply. Then you get to the point where you can actually get a visa to come in. I would assume that that would not be satisfactory to you because the marital relationship would be interrupted for -- for 20 years.   Well, I -- I understand that. But my point is that the logic of your position gets to reordering the visa preferences. If you say the fact of the marital relationship gives these certain rights, then it would seem to me -- because they can't keep the husband and wife apart, it seems to me that goes to the length of -- that you have to wait for your -- your visa. So it does go to the -- the tiniest reordering of the immigration preferences.   Well, okay. But I mean, my point is, it goes -- it goes to the big reordering as well.   I mean, you have change -- depending upon Congress's ordering of the preferences, you might have to change a great deal.   What if there weren't? That seems to be fighting the hypothetical. Say there is no process established to seek review of that.   Well, I know, but what if there weren't? In other words, does the marital relation entitle the wife to review of the decision to imprison the convicted husband in Colorado rather than New York?   Those are rights that go to the prisoner.   So the spouse has no additional rights, even though her marital relationship will be affected.   Well, then, I thought you said no. So you now think that the spouse whose husband is convicted and sent to the maximum security prison far away has a constitutionally protected interest with respect to that separation?   No, no. I know my hypothetical is different from your case.
13-1487 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Ms. O'Connell. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL 0 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Where did it -- the ability to sell something depends upon ownership, not possession. If I leave my car with a garage for a month, the garage has possession, but they can't sell the car. I don't have possession, but I can sell the car. In other words, I don't see how it gets to be constructive possession. All he's asserting is a right to ownership, which carries with it the right to sell.   But he doesn't -- he doesn't have much control when the government is holding them. He's -- he's just trying to sell them. He doesn't want to control them. He doesn't want to use them. He doesn't want to possess them, constructively or otherwise. In fact, he wants to get rid of them, which is what the statute is supposed to accomplish.   What if -- what if he wants to donate them to someone? He wants to donate them to the Texas National Guard? Could he do that? I mean, the -- the Federal firearms dealer doesn't help you there.   No, I mean, no, he can't do it or --   To the Federal government he says, I -- I'm sorry about the conviction. I want to give these to the Federal government. Can he do that?   I -- I guess that's what he's doing.   But the idea -- the idea that it should be sold through a Federal firearms dealer is a late idea. This was not something the government proposed at any stage below until the case came here, right?   Well, what did you anticipate -- what was your position before you changed it here in this Court about what should happen to the guns?   Has the Federal government ever used these guns?   Not these particular ones but guns that were forfeited by a convicted felon and someone who couldn't sell them to anyone, at least until you changed the position and said they could sell them to a firearms dealer? They just sat around gathering dust?   That's not -- that's not going to get it done. You still have the problem of the court below's view of the Unclean Hands Doctrine. Do you have a position, the Federal government -- does the Federal Government have a position on that doctrine now?   Justice -- Justice Alito.   You can finish your sentence.
13-1499 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Richard. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY RICHARD ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, but there's not always such an appearance. What if a judge calls, you know, a college classmate, says, you know, believe it or not I'm a judge and -- and I'm running for election. Could you give me some money? Direct -- direct in person -- or direct solicitation. But nobody would say there's any real risk of corruption because he's calling up his old friends, let's say, who's not -- they're not lawyers.   Well, there's a difference between micromanaging and overinclusiveness or under-inclusiveness. I mean, could -- this could be easily limited to litigants or lawyers appearing before the Court.   Is there really a -- the prospect of the appearance of partiality if you have a radio ad that -- with the judge and says, you know, these -- this is my philosophy, please send me a contribution? Is anybody going to think, oh, that judge is not -- is going to be partial to one side or another?   Well, I'm sorry, but you -- up to this point you've been saying what a significant difference it makes whether someone can solicit in person or not, and that's why you've drawn the line there. And now you're telling us, well, it doesn't make much of a difference at all.   It seems to me that it's -- it's self-evident, particularly in judicial races, where that the -- prohibiting a form of raising funds is to the great advantage of the incumbent because the only way that, in most judicial raises, the judge -- incumbents are going to be challenged if you have somebody who can get their own distinct message out.   I  I still don't see how that's inconsistent with the rest of your argument. What you've been saying before is it's just a little bit that we prohibit, so don't worry about it. And -- and I mean the -- the prohibition was limited to the important area. It's face-to-face that is important. And now you're saying it's no big deal because they can do all these other things. How do you reconcile those two positions?   Well, 800 years ago, judges were not elected. I mean, I appreciate the challenge you're -- you're under. You're kind of backing and filling. The fundamental choice was made by the State when they said we're going to have judges elected, and I mean, you're kind of, as I say, you're trying to patch the problem there. But, I mean, you have a situation where the people in the State have said we're going to have judges elected and we're going to recognize that you can contribute to judges because of there are contribution limits. It seems to me you -- you're under a great burden in trying to figure out how you're going to fix that without contravening the First Amendment.
13-212 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Ms. Mizner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   We've -- we've kind of gotten far afield, which I'm sure is not -- may not be fair to Mr. Fisher or Mr. Dumont, we're talking about their case, but in your case why isn't the information in plain view? It says, "my house, my home." They look at it, that's what they see. They don't have to open anything.   Sure. But I'm saying do you have -- you have no objection to the "my house"?   I assume that that's -- it says "my house" because he's done something with the particular number. If he didn't, it would be the number itself that would show up, right?   And so that would also be in plain view?   No, no. But I mean, in a -- in a case in which the user had not coded the particular number, the number would show up, I think, right?   And that would be --   Okay.   What do you think, if the phone rings, can the police answer it?   Well, what about this case where there isn't a search warrant?   The number's in plain view. I mean, is answering the phone -- can you do it or not? You know what number is calling. Is it like someone -- you're conducting a search on the house and somebody knocks on the door? You can open the door, right?   So do you think -- it's got nothing to do with plain hearing. I'm not saying they can't -- obviously they can hear the ring. I'm just -- it's a big, different step to answer it.   No, they could   Well, if it wasn't -- if it wasn't input, you would have the number itself in plain view.   You wouldn't know it was the house.   No, but the point is the only -- the only information they got and used was the phone number and address of his house, right? And -- and that it was his house, right?   That's on your driver's license, isn't it? So -- and --   So I guess I'm just trying to see what greater invasion of privacy there was in this case than the police looking at your driver's license when you're carrying it around in your wallet.   So the problem here was that he called -- he indicated that a number was his house, and it might not have been his house?   Well, as opposed to what? Carrying it around somewhere other than your pocket? I mean, do -- do you think there's a difference if it's attached to someone's belt and everybody can see it or if it's in a pocket?   Surely it's more private if it's locked in your car or kept in your house.   Carrying it with you in public makes it less private.   Or a gun.   This is kind of   It's not a bomb, but this a different case. This is somebody in an area selling drugs where the police have told us they typically use cell phones to arrange the deals and the transfers, and this guy is caught with two cell phones. Why would he have two cell phones?   Really? What is -- what is your authority for the statement that many people have multiple cell phones on their person?   Particularly since they're in their pockets, right? Well, it -- does -- do you -- is it insignificant, in your view, that the cell phone was a method for which criminal transactions were typically undertaken in this area and that the fellow had two cell phones rather than what I would have thought is the more normal one?
13-271 +++$+++    Mr. Fisher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER, ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   You could say the same for setting prices of anything at all. I mean, that's kind of the idea, is that if it affects -- if the price is affecting sales, then it is preemptive. The fact that they may engage in certain practices that affect sales is not a bad thing in the abstract. I mean, you -- the case is proceeding on the ground that you are dealing with a practice that is, you know, offensive in both contexts. But the state and FERC may have different views on that. So the fact that the jurisdictional sellers engage in a practice that affects wholesale rates is not -- shouldn't be regarded as problematic.   No, no, not just the sales, but the practices affecting the wholesale, which is kind of the key to their argument.   Thank you, counsel.
13-352 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Well, the -- the issues are not always different. Justice Breyer's lipstick example, I mean, that's sold in a retail market. So the question is not -- there isn't going to be a different use from what the TTAB is looking at and what you want to be able to look at de novo. But I gather in your case, you say these building fasteners, people don't go buy them like they buy lipstick, it's only more sophisticated general contractors. So why isn't that enough of an answer to say that as a general matter, the TTAB provisions are preclusive, but if you are showing a different -- a difference in use or a more specialized use or something other than what the TTAB would have been looking at, preclusion doesn't apply. Which I gather is -- is the way preclusion normally works.   Well, I'm more concerned if the argument is available to you. I mean, in other words, you're the one that is asking for the absence of preclusion. And it seems to me that you could prevail on the idea that when the -- when the uses are actually different it's not precluded, but when they -- they are not -- when they are the same, it is. That's the basic preclusion rule.   So just to make sure I understand, you are saying the mark is just S-I-K-E without the swoosh.
13-433 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Thierman. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. THIERMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Yes, but this is -- no one's principal activity is going through security screening. The employer doesn't hire somebody, I need somebody to go through employee screening. He hires them to do something else and then the employee screening is certainly not the principal.   Well then, I guess I don't understand what "principal" means. You're saying everything that is related somehow to the job is principal. I would have thought principal has to do with things that are more significantly related. You would say, typically, if somebody asked what do you do, if you were one of these people, you would say, oh, I fill orders for Amazon. I mean, it may be part of that that you go through security at the end of the day, but that doesn't make it a principal activity.   Then I don't know why don't you say "activities" rather than "principal activities"?   I know you say it because you want to fit under the statute, but I'm saying I don't understand. It seems to me you're just saying anything that is required for the benefit of the employer is a principal activity.   The workers are told: You've got to check out. It's something they are told they have to do.   And under your theory that would be a principal activity.   All of this is subject to collective bargaining. In other words, you're sitting down and you say we want it to be $15 an hour and you're asking for a dollar raise and you'll say, look, one reason we should get it is because we have to wait a half hour to get out or whatever, and that's -- whether it's compensable time or not, that can certainly be a factor that goes into the collective bargaining.   This comes out because it's after the fact. And after it's all taken place, you go back and say we should get -- what are these, double damages or --   But going forward, they can always say, oh, we're not going -- the court says we're not going to get compensated for this time so we're going to insist on a higher amount of the hourly wage for the 8 hours that we do get compensated for.   Well, a lot of the employees covered by this are union employees, right?   Thank you. Thank you, counsel.
13-435 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C GOLDSTEIN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Yeah, well, that's your -- your case, but I gather your answer to Justice Alito is that the CEO doesn't know about anything, and his lawyer comes in and says, Nope, I don't know about anything, then that cannot be the basis for a suit?   No, I'm asking you, is it reasonable for --   -- him to say, I don't know anything about any bribes. The lawyer comes in, Do you know anything about bribes? No, I don't know anything about any bribes. Is it reasonable for him to say, In our opinion, our employees are not giving bribes?   Okay. Thank you. Ms. Saharsky. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS   You were asking, in Justice Kennedy's, you said it was right and wrong, and then you got the part out about it being right. What -- in what way was it wrong?   Why can't that be submitted to the jury? In other words, you can look, not to see if in fact it has a reasonable basis, but to use the evidence about how unreasonable the basis must be to suggest that the belief was not sincere?   If someone comes in, in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, and there's no basis at all and says, "I believe that this," and the evidence shows he had no basis at all, a jury can easily determine, we don't think he really believed it.

Well --   But your argument -- your argument is this is going to be something lawyers are going to ask about in every case.   It seems to me -- it seems to me if you're dealing with California, you would have a lot more evidence of that, since they operate under the rule that your friend is arguing for.   Is there any -- is there any alternative remedy available that doesn't go to the validity of the verdict? You know, the Petitioners allegedly were injured to a great extent by the jurors' -- I could call it fraud, I guess. Can they bring an act -- direct action against her?   Thank you, counsel.

Well, what if one of the members of the board is appointed as a full-time member of the board for a one-year term and he's -- he's called the board state supervisor, is that good enough?   No. It's only -- it's one year. But for that one year he's not practicing dentistry or whatever. And that way the supervisor is -- responsive to Justice Breyer's concern -- the supervisor knows what he's talking about when it comes to dentistry.   Okay. So he has the authority. For that one year, he can veto whatever the board decides to do.

13-553 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Well, just on the comparison class, can't you let the water carriers go? I mean, it's a very tiny percentage that's at issue. It's governed by the admission to the Union. They sometimes touch down in Alabama, they sometimes don't. And I don't want to have the case up here a third time.   So if there's one water carrier, you win? Or if there's one odd method of transportation, you win?   That sounds like most-favored nation to me.   Now, just to get back to them, it's 1 percent and 6 percent of what?   Interstate business.   I might have -- I might have missed it, but why isn't it a sufficient justification for different treatment of the water carriers that the statute admitting Alabama to the union said they couldn't tax traffic on the river?   The Constitution might have changed, but the statute didn't.
13-604 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Fisher. Mr. Montgomery. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. MONTGOMERY. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   That's a very broad definition of reasonable. I understand the idea that when, you know, 99 people out of a hundred think you have to have two brake lights, like you do everywhere else in the country, that it's reasonable for the police officer to think that. But it sounds to me like you're adopting the same standard that we apply in qualified immunity, which gives the officers quite -- quite broad scope, and that -- that's troubling.   You would not give a pass -- I mean, let's say the case is flipped here and the most reasonable reading of the statute is that you only need one brake light. And so someone's driving around with one brake light. You pull him over. He's going to say: I reasonably thought that, you know, I -- I only -- I only needed one. And the Court comes out and says, I needed two. In that case, ignorance of the law would not save him, would it?   I'd like to focus again on your definition of reasonableness. Let's say you have two court of appeals decisions. One says you need two brake lights; the other says you need one. Is it reasonable for the officer to pull somebody over when one of their two brake lights is burned out?   Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner. ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT   So where do you come out in my hypothetical of the two court of appeals decisions? Is that reasonable for the officer to say, "Well, I'm going to pick this one and follow that?"
13-628 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli. ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   What -- what if there were a law that said precisely pretty much what you just said? The law says, okay, Mr. President, you can recognize whoever you want, but if you recognize this -- this country, this government, we're going to treat it as if you hadn't recognized this government. For all purposes of domestic law, we're going to pretend -- we're going to operate on the assumption that you have recognized this country.   So -- so that law would be unconstitutional?   Well, isn't that exactly what the Taiwan Relations Act says? What it says is, "The absence of diplomatic recognition shall not affect the application of the laws of the United States with respect to Taiwan."   Well, let's say the President -- let's say the President did not want to recognize Taiwan and Congress passes a law that says for every purpose under American law, we will treat Taiwan as if it had been recognized?   If it had -- if it were such a big deal, why did the Chief Executive at the time sign it?   So we should give no weight to the fact that the Chief Executive signed the law that he is now saying has such a dramatic -- that his successor, but I gather the position is the same -- is now saying has such deleterious effects on American foreign policy? Well, as a general matter, does that have any consequence at all?   Oh, no. I know, I'm not suggesting it does, although that's a separate question. But it does go to the credibility of the assertion that this is going to have such dramatic effects on American foreign policy.   But that's partly because the Executive Branch made such a big deal out of it. I mean, they issue a statement saying, this is unconstitutional and all that. They could easily have said, this is no big deal, they're just letting whoever is born there pick the name they want to put on --   -- nothing to see here, move on, and we're proving that by going ahead and signing it. And over the -- over the intervening course, the executive has litigated this. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that it's going to be such a huge deal.   What if it just says "Disputed," parentheses after it, "Disputed"? Then I gather they wouldn't be lying. They would be telling the truth.   Well, it's disputed as a matter of the government of the United States. Part of the government says this -- well, actually, no, I mean, Congress is not saying under my hypothetical, this is Israel. It's saying there's a dispute about it, which I would think is about as true a statement as you can make.   Let's say there's a -- that passports are printed in Country A, not the United States, and there's a printing plant there, and Congress passes a law saying, no, you must have the passports printed in Country B because we don't think you should recognize Country A. Does that interfere with the President's recognition power?   Because Congress wished the President would not recognize Country A. So in response to that, we're directing that passports that are now printed in Country A be printed in Country B.   I thought your position was that the President has the exclusive right to decide what interferes with his recognition power.   But just like the signing statement.   Just like the signing statement, which said precisely what Justice Kennedy suggested, that the Executive could do at this point.

WAXMAN ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   That's a very -- that's a very -- you're putting an awful lot of weight on a tiny, one-sentence provision in (g) that's called "additional relief" that -- I think it would be very odd if that's where Congress decided to place the provision that tells you what happened -- what happens when there's exercise of the right to rescind.
13-7120 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash. ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN F. BASH ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES   But we -- but we know that's not true. We know there are 40,000 registered that by -- and, you know, and you yourself I think said or -- that if you're willing to give your photograph and fingerprint or whatever to the Federal Government, you're probably not going to use it illegally. So we know it's not true that these are exclusively used in criminal activity.   Well, what number would be enough? I mean if we had 100,000 registrations, does that mean that it's no longer conduct that presents a serious potential risk?   Well, then -- then is possession, possession of explosives, an offense under this enhancement provision?   Even though the statute -- even though the statute says use of explosives is covered?   You'd say, well, under the catch-all phrase, mere possession is covered.   Well, that's a second step, unlike the others. When you're engaged in a burglary, the -- the risk is there. When it's mere possession, the risk isn't there. You have to take an additional step of taking it and using it in a crime.   Well, or the homeowner could happen to have a short-barreled shotgun and shoot the burglar.   Then the violence doesn't depend on any additional act by the burglar.   So the parallel you're drawing is that burglary itself doesn't present a risk of violence until the burglar pulls a gun?   That -- you're -- is that the 40,000 you're talking about?   When you say a few thousand, is that the same statistic as --   I might have used a different word than a few thousand.   Yes, that would (Laughter.)

We still don't have any basis and they know, gosh, the one thing we -- we can't do is say why we are doing it. They have a blank check? They can do that forever without any review by this Court?   Well, one thing we know is that they denied it upon careful consideration of the parties' submissions as well as the applicable law. Was there anything in the parties' submissions other than the guestion on which we granted cert?   You can't escape that easily.   Thank you, counsel.
13-7211 +++$+++    Thank you, counselor. Mr. Oldham. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. OLDHAM ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   How would you do that? How would you cure the Spisak error?   Well, the Spisak error is something that the lawyer said in closing argument. You're going to have a new trial, right? Well, presumably, I mean, the lawyer may say the same thing or the new lawyer may say the exact same thing or he may not. It seems to me that it's a fairly academic dispute as to whether or not you have a separate claim once you have the relief of a new trial.   There's always -- you always have the same level of constitutional performance. This is only going to come up as a particular problem if for some reason the lawyer says exactly the same thing in closing as the prior lawyer did. And I don't anticipate that happening.   Well, the reason there might not be any, I mean, any decision by the Federal court in that situation would be, I think, a purely advisory opinion. Let's say he loses on a confrontation clause claim, he wins on inadequate assistance of counsel. He takes the appeal. If I'm the judge on appeal I say, well, in the new trial, they may not call the witness that you said shouldn't have been called and you want me to issue an advisory opinion just in case they do. I don't see how he can do that.   But they -- you keep talking about the conditional release order. It doesn't say anything about what the State must do, what errors it must correct, it's on page 35, it just says give him a new sentencing hearing or sentence him to a term of imprisonment. It doesn't say, because of this, because of that, because of this.   Oh, sure. I mean, there may be situations in which the State or the ineffective counsel, they do repeat the error, or they may not.
13-7451 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Martinez. 0 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Why are those -- why are those the key words? Why don't you start earlier? "Knowingly alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, cover up, falsify, "those are certainly pertinent in analyzing the reach of "tangible object," aren't they?   The fish were -- how many inches short of permitted were the fish?   But according --   But according -- if I understand your answer to Justice Scalia, according to the Justice Department manual, any case in which someone destroys a tangible object, you -- you should prosecute them under this statute, because I assume 20 years is the maximum available penalty?   But the point is that you could, and the point is that once you can, every time you get somebody who is throwing fish overboard, you can go to him and say: Look, if we prosecute you you're facing 20 years, so why don't you plead to a year, or something like that. It's an extraordinary leverage that the broadest interpretation of this statute would give Federal prosecutors.   Well, but -- when you say this -- I understood your friend to say "tangible object" is only used in record statutes. In 1512 --   -- it's -- it's "object," I mean tangible -- yeah, "tangible thing." In 1512 it's "object," right?   Well, see, the reason -- I mean, maybe that makes a difference if you have records, documents, and then a tangible object suggests that the tangible nature of it is what's significant, which suggests that it may be one of the -- you know, whatever the drive thing is as opposed to a record. And that's a point that's not present in the statutes that you were citing.   Well, isn't that like the Bond decision? I mean, you had text that could be read broadly, and yet we suggested, well, Congress could not have meant the Chemical Weapons Treaty to cover a minor dusting of -- with toxic, irritating chemicals.   Well, what if you stopped them on the street and said is a fish record document or tangible object?
13-854 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Jay. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE   Under your view, two different district courts construing the same patent could come out to opposite results based on a subsidiary factual finding, and neither of those would be clearly erroneous, and yet on a public patent that is going to bind a lot of other people, people won't know what to do. You have two different interpretations of the patent. What happens then?   Well, that's just kind of avoiding the question. I mean, you can easily envision this case coming up differently in the district court depending upon what district courts find as the, you know, accepted understanding to artisans. And again, each of those opposite results, neither one may be clearly erroneous.   No. It's because you have a patent which is a public document that is binding the world in terms of what other inventors can do and another inventor looking at it can say, well, what can I do?   He doesn't know. That is very different than just a particular negligence case that comes up.   Thank you, Ms. Anders. Mr. Phillips. ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
13-894 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Katyal. ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Which way does that cut? It seems to me that cuts very much against you. In other words, whistleblowers are blowing the whistle all the time without any justification. That's I thought the government's point, that this reguires, puts all the eggs in the basket of whatever the whistleblower happens to think is a good disclosure.   Well, I'm a little -- maybe this doesn't make any sense, but you've been focusing on specifically as referring to the material that is covered. Can't it also refer to the -- the prohibition, specifically prohibited? In other words, it actually has to say, "You cannot disclose this." You think it's specifying what "this" is. Couldn't it egually be well specifying how direct the ban must be, "specifically prohibited"?

13-9026 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Carpenter. Mr. Fletcher. ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   Yes, but all the definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with somebody as an associate or companion. Yes, it is certainly a permissible use and a common use in context to say I accompanied someone across the hall. But when you are in the context that this present one is of bank robbery, the point of associate or companion, I think, takes on greater weight. Obviously, an unwilling one.   All right, you take two bank robberies. One, the robber comes in, waves a gun, pistol whips five people, grabs the money and leaves. Okay? In another the bank robber comes in, just gets the bag of money, says, you walk over here 2 feet with me, so he can get the bag of money and leaves. The first one you could get probation. I mean, you're not going to, but there's no mandatory sentence. And the second one you get at least 10 years. That doesn't make any sense.   But they didn't care exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year because of extenuating circumstances, whatever. But, they said, forcing someone to accompany you is so much more serious that you get at least 10 years.   Range where?   But the point is the idea of someone whose bank is being robbed not being forcibly compelled to accompany someone is fanciful, and all you have to do, again -- I guess it's repeating the guestion -- is you got two feet and the prosecutor is armed with another 10 years automatically in his pocket, and then you use that to extort a plea bargain of, you know, six years, somebody who might otherwise wanted to go to trial.   Well, that begs the guestion, I think.   Well, your U.S. attorney's manual does just that. It says you prosecute these when anyone forcibly abducts another during the commission of any offense. That seems to me to be trying to take out those walked two feet. That's not a forcible abduction.   So -- so you think when the manual says forcibly abducts, it means the two-foot situation.   So the manual is read -- forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to move two feet. That's an abduction?   And so the manual which -- the other provision in the manual which is that you should charge as large an offense as possible means that in the case where somebody is forced to move two feet, you charge the -- that as a forcible abduction.   So is two feet consistent with the conduct at issue?   No, no. That is exactly where the prosecutor needs another ace in his hand. In other words, if he's waving a gun, if he's assaulting the people, if he's shooting them, fine, he's got enough leverage. But when he hasn't done any of that and all he's done is asked the teller or whoever to accompany him for -- of forced, I'm sorry, the teller to accompany him for a few feet, that's where the prosecutor says I, you know, it's a good thing I've got these 10 years or otherwise he might go to trial.   How would you -- how would you see the evidence of prosecutorial abuse? When you have these cases, he says I'm going to charge you with a 10-year minimum, and the guy says, my gosh, I can't risk that, I'm going to plead guilty to 6 years or 7 years. I don't see how that pattern could show up in any kind of statistics.   It would not be a reported case because he would have pled guilty.   When they plead guilty don't they have to -- I don't remember if this is just limited to the State systems or not -- don't they have to waive their rights to appeal?   Well, I just don't see that as a common sense proposition. If you're a teller, when are you more scared, when the guy has a gun pointed at you and says get the money or when the guy does not have a gun so far as you can see and says you better come with me over to the vault?

13-983 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dreeben. ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT   Well, but in context is right. What is it? Is it a reasonable person and the examples that were given of the, you know, teenagers on the internet, or is it a -- reasonable teenager on the internet. (Laughter.)   So it's -- but there again, we're talking about what subculture you're looking at. I mean, is the -- the internet exchange, is it the -- what the reasonable teenager thinks how it would be understood by the recipient of the text?   Well, I know, but you are asking for a standard that presumably would apply across the board. So if the teenager has a lot of friends on his Facebook page then you are going to evaluate it by a different standard; you know, friends all over different age groups and everything else, that's a different standard than if he has only a few friends that have access to his statements?   If you have -- if you have a statement made in the style of rap music as this one or several of these were, is the reasonable person supposed to be someone familiar with that style and the use of what might be viewed as threatening words in connection with that music or is -- or not?   To a general audience.   So that does subject to prosecution the lyrics that a lot of rap artists use.   So how do you start out if you want to be a rap artist? Your first communication you can't say, I'm an artist, right?   What about the language at pages 54 to 55 of the Petitioner's brief? You know, "Da-da make a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake," "tie a rope around a rock," this is during the context of a domestic dispute between a husband and wife. "There goes mama splashing in the water, no more fighting with dad," you know, all that stuff. Now, under your test, could that be prosecuted.   Because Eminem said it instead of somebody else?   Well, yes, but you're dealing with some very inflammatory language. The guestion is whether or not the jury is going to be swept away with the language as opposed to making the subtle determinations you've been talking about.   You have time to answer.   Thank you, counsel.
13-9972 +++$+++    Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Ms. Anders. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT   I mean, the reason I don't understand -- I don't understand when you're talking about prolonging the stop, are you talking about here's the amount of time that you are -- needed for the traffic stop and you're allowed to prolong it sometime after that? Or is it that the -- the sniff is part of the time for the stop so you're not prolonging it at all? You're including it, you're wrapping it up in the stop.   You say -- you've said several times the phrase "incremental." My -- I sense that it being less than, right? I mean, if the actual traffic stop is 5 minutes, then you wouldn't say a 15-minute dog sniff is incremental. So doesn't the dog sniff have to be less than the traffic stop?   Is that almost always the case, that the dog sniff is going to take longer than the traffic stop? I mean, I would assume so. The officer says license and registration, goes back, checks, comes back and gives you the ticket. The dog sniff is something else altogether. Assuming the dog is there, they've got to get -- you know, walk around the car. If you're -- if it really has to be incremental, I'm not sure -- it's hardly ever going to be reasonable.   If the dog happens to be there, I guess.

14-114 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. General Verrilli, you'll have extra ten minutes as well. ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   Well, you're surely not raising a standing guestion with us here for the first time at oral argument, are you?   This is -- this is on a motion to dismiss, right?   If you're right if you're right about Chevron, that would indicate that a subsequent administration could change that interpretation?
14-15 +++$+++    Thank you, Mr. Kneedler. Mr. Piotrowski. 0 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PIOTROWSKI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS   If there were a set of rules to that effect, would you still have an action under the Supremacy Clause, or not?   So -- but what you're saying is if the -- you cannot rely on the Supremacy Clause to enforce the action in that case because there are particular rules that give you an avenue of relief, right?   Okay. How is that different than -- I mean, from the private cause of action? What you're saying in that case is you're not going -- you know, you're going to follow these rules in one situation, but you're not going to follow the rules in the other situation.   It's a good question.   When Congress has been silent. What if Congress has been express? What if they say in the statute, and to be clear, there is no private right of action to enforce this provision, under the statute, under the Supremacy Clause, under anything?   What if it -- what if it means that Congress doesn't want to review a private right of action? Because for the reasons that have been set forth in our implied right-of-action cases, there's an expert Federal agency that regulates in this context, there's other avenues of relief for people, they just say, look, we're entrusting this to HHS. It would be too difficult if every provider can bring a cause of action, if every provider under every provision of the healthcare act can bring a private right of action, we want the agency to be the one in charge of implementing this.   If you have --   What -- there are dozens of different types of providers under the Act. There's home care providers, you have dentists, you have brain surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, everything. And in most instances -- I don't know, maybe all -- they have a similar provision: Rates have to be reasonable to ensure the availability. Now, what do you do if -- if each of those providers bring a lawsuit similar to yours? The effect, it seems to me, will be putting the setting of budget priorities in the hands of dozens of different Federal judges, and I just don't know what the practical significance of that's going to be.   That's in each -- in each particular case, right? Let's just say down the street in the next courthouse or across the river in Montana or whatever that there is a suit going on for orthopedic surgeons. Their rates are not reasonable and they bring the same suit. What -- it seems to me that this is a prescription for budget-busting across the board.   Well, if that's correct, then it's -- again, as Justice Breyer pointed out, there's no way to allow you to seek that relief under an implied right of action under the Supremacy Clause without opening the courthouse door to everybody who says the Federal law was not followed, whether it was in going from 80 to 60 or improving the methodology or whatever.   Well, so it doesn't matter. The discussion we'd be having over it's whether it's 60 or 80, the rates, or if it's the methodology. Under your theory of the case, it doesn't matter. You still get into Federal court, right?   Are those merits determinations?
14-86 +++$+++    Thank you, counsel. Mr. Dvoretzky. 5 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT   No, but that doesn't work in a case like this. It's not a question, are you treating everybody the same. You have an obligation to accommodate people with particular religious practice or beliefs, so to keep constantly saying, oh, we would have treated somebody with a baseball cap the same way doesn't seem to me is very responsive.   No, no, no, but as I understand it, it's intentional discrimination because you failed to accommodate.
