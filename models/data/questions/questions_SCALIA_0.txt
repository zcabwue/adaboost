04-1034 +++$+++             It goes somewhat beyond the smallest trickle?          Doesn't it?          Doesn't it also include ditches that currently don't have any trickle if they obtain a trickle during a rainstorm?            Couldn't you simply assume that anything that is discharged into a tributary ultimately goes where the tributary goes?                   Wouldn't it be enough to prove the discharge?            So you don't think it would be enough for the -- for the Government to prove the discharge into a tributary in order to prove that the act has been violated.       You really think it has to trace the molecules.       More than that, Mr. Hopper. I thought and I had expected you to -- to respond to Justice Souter's question this way, his question about how come putting poison in -- in the wetlands is bad, but it's okay to put it in the tributary.                But they -- as I understand it, the reason we held wetlands were included within the waters of the United States was not -- not that, that you could poison the waters by poisoning the wetlands, but rather, it was that it's very hard to tell where the navigable water ends and the wetland begins.         And -- and we said, you know, we're not going to parse that.               If it's -- if it's adjacent to a navigable water and it's wet, we're going to say it's part of a navigable water.       I thought that was our basis.       And, of course, that basis doesn't apply to tributaries, does it?                  You -- you can always tell where the tributary ends.                  It ends at the point where it goes into the main river.       I'm not sure what you mean by a hydrological connection.              Do you mean a constant -- a constant body of water between the two, or do you mean simply a -- a drain that at some times might carry off rainwater from -- from this land?                  And -- would that -- would that suffice to be a hydrological connection?       Water never ran off of this -- of this land.       Mr. Stoepker, your friend, Mr. Hopper, would certainly not agree with you that -- that a -- a hydrological connection is the, quote, traditional test.            What -- what is your definition of tradition?       How long has this test been established?       Traditionally.       Yes --       From the inception of the rules.       That that alone has been enough.       I see.      So you're -- you're not conceding that -- that hydrologic -- hydrological connection is adequate.           You're just -- is sufficient. You're just saying it's necessary.       Okay.       You don't -- you don't have to define what -- everything that's necessary. All you have to define is one indispensable element. And all you're arguing is that a hydrological connection is an indispensable element, whatever additional elements --       -- there may be.   So you may agree with your friend, Mr. Hopper.       You -- you just haven't reached that point.         Right?       I don't want to set you two to fighting with each other.       What we're talking about here is -- is at -- at most, whether this is a water of the United States.        The condition for requiring permits is that it -- it be a water of the United States. Isn't that right?       And it either is or it isn't, not -- not that it will be.                 It either is or it isn't.       If it is, you -- you need a permit; if it isn't, you don't need a permit.       And the only reason it's a water of the United States is that there are some puddles on this land.          Right?      And if there were no puddles, it -- it wouldn't be a water of the United States.        It would just be land of the United States.        So it -- it becomes waters of the United States because there are puddles on it, and you assert because those puddles have some hydrological connection or if it is -- if it is water of the United States, those puddles have some hydrological connections with the navigable waters.        And -- and the -- the statute only prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material, which is what is going on here, into the navigable waters, right, at specified disposal sites. I'm sorry.          The -- the permits that -- that are required here --        -- permit discharge into waters, not -- not into lands that aren't waters.       Do you think it -- do you think it mean adjacent with a berm in between?                I -- I thought the reason they -- they reached that conclusion was you can't tell where the navigable water ends and where the wetland begins.            I -- I thought they assumed a connection between the two.       Mr. Hopper, I hope you're going to tell us what you make of section 404(g).
04-10566 +++$+++           That court is not a common law court, is it?          And not being a common law court, it's not bound by its own prior decisions, is it?          I think its statute says that it -- it decides the particular case and does not set forth propositions of law that are binding in future cases.            If it's not bound by its prior cases, I don't know why we should be.       What -- what remedies have other countries provided for -- for these rights?                   I mean, it's -- it's easy to say the right exists.                What -- what have other countries done by way of vindicating these rights?       I mean, advising them of them is -- is really not vindicating them, it doesn't seem to me.       Well, that's -- but, you know, that's what the other side said the whole thing should consist of, that it's a matter to be enforced by -- by state-to-state protests, not -- not by the judicial system or the legal system taking it upon itself to provide a remedy. What -- what remedies have been provided in -- in other countries?              You -- you mentioned an exclusion in Australia?          When -- when was that?           Well, it's a source of authority but not a source of authority for suppression.             And I find it implausible that we signed a treaty which requires us to suppress evidence of this sort, but allows the other treaty partners to do whatever they like, not -- not suppress, let it in, rely upon consular protests.                   Is -- is that what this provision, you know, in accordance with domestic law, means, that -- you know, each man to himself?       That may give you a warmer feeling inside, but do you think that the foreign consulate is -- is more likely to give you good advice about what you should do under American law than an American lawyer that you've been provided?       Yes, but I'm just saying whether it makes any difference.                I mean, you're talking about anything that -- that affects substantive rights.        He's been provided an attorney who knows American law better, presumably, than -- than a consular official.        What -- other than the comfort of -- of speaking to somebody from his own country, what -- what's the substantive harm here?       That's fine, but --       Go ahead.       Yes, we do.               We'd have to make an 8-hour ruling in this case anyway if -- if we agree with you.               Gee, what about -- what about countries that don't have an extensive telephone system, you know, where you -- you have to send a runner to notify the consul?               Well, it -- it just makes me think that -- that instant contact is not what was envisioned by the treaty.       Can I come back to the conflict of interest?           Was -- was this lawyer a compensated lawyer, or was he a public defender?       He was retained.       By whom?           I -- I thought you said the third condition was creation of a cause of action.       Where -- where is that in this statute?       You meant the statute has to create a cause of action.       I mean, the -- the treaty has to create a cause of action.
04-1067 +++$+++        Why?       Why?       Why --       Why not?          I --       You're talking about --       -- reasonable expectations, I suppose, here.       Why do you assume that it - - that it is the reasonable expectation of two people who have -- who are living together in -- on -- in common premises, that, where one of them wants somebody to come in, and the other one does not want somebody to come in, the person may come in?                I would think that the normal assumption is just the opposite, that, where one wants somebody excluded, that person will be excluded.       In --       In Matlock --       In Matlock --       In Matlock, did the -- did the absent person say no?       So, you --       -- you don't even have, in Matlock, a situation where you know that one of the parties didn't want entry.                You don't know that.     You -- there was one party there, and that party said, "Okay, come in."            And the other party said, "Well, if I had been consulted, I would have said no," or whatever.          But --            Mr. Dreeben, does this authority to let someone in, over the objection of the cohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it -- is it also the case that -- I don't know, as a matter of, what, property law, or whatever? -- that when two people have common ownership of a piece of land or a house or whatever, and one of them says, "I don't want a certain party to come on," the tie always goes to the other party, who says, "I do want somebody to come on," is that -- is there any cases that establish that proposition?              It seems to me an odd proposition.          I would have thought the opposite.          All she said is, "He's a cocaine user."            Does that -- does that -- does that give probable cause to believe that there are -- you know, that there's contraband on the premises or --          Oh.          Yes.
04-1084 +++$+++        It's --       But it still shows -- whatever power they were -- they were proceeding under, it still shows that it's not all that important that nobody be able to use a substance banned by category 1.                    I mean --       -- whatever power it was under, it's a demonstration that you can make an exception without the sky falling.         And that's why we came out the other way in Smith, by the way.       But --       -- RFRA overrides all that.       I understand RFRA to be -- to say there can be an exception to all Federal statutes where someone makes a religious objection to compliance and, in the judgment of the court, there's not a compelling State interest in the Government going ahead with the statute.          So, you know, whatever the scheme was under the drug laws, it seems to me it's subject to this new legislation.       But that --       Couldn't have said it better. And that's what we said in Smith.                But Congress didn't like Smith and has enacted this statute obviously to undo, to the extent it can, the effect of our judgment in Smith.            But that's okay.
04-1131 +++$+++             We re not bound by that concession.          If that s a jurisdictional question, doesn t matter whether the Government conceded it or not, does it?            That s a different question.          I still think it s whether because I don t agree with the Government.                  Can I do that?          So that is the question.         I mean, the question is open whether there --          But our cases say that where we don t speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not regarded as having been decided.        Even -- even if you assume that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different situation here.          The issue isn t whether there will be any judicial review.           The issue is whether there will be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are -- that are not -- for which judicial review was not provided.         Any major employee action -- judicial review, as I understand it, is available, and it is only relatively insignificant actions for which judicial review is not available.                 Isn t that right?        He could have refused -- he could have refused the search, in which case if there was any significant personnel action taken against him for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of whether the search was constitutional or not.        That s often the case where -- where, in -- in order to challenge a governmental action, you -- you have to be willing to -- to go to court by resisting it.           But that search was a consequence of his employment.                   It -- this wasn t a search of a -- of a citizen who had no connection with the Government.             It was a search that he was required to submit to as an employee.                   So to -- to describe it as unrelated to employee action seems to me unrealistic.             The only reason he submitted to it was that if he didn t, he would have -- he would have been subject to an employee action.       Ms. -- Ms. Karlan, if this is indeed serious, are you sure that it s not a personnel action?       There is a residual category in the definition of personnel action which says, any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.           That s the residual category. But one of the specifically named categories, before you get to that, is a decision to order psychiatric testing.           Now, if that kind of a decision could be a personnel action, why couldn t a decision to conduct -- to conduct a drug test be considered a personnel action?       I m not adding it.        There s a residual category at the end:               or any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.         I consider this -- you consider it a significant change in working conditions.       And he thought he didn t have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know? He s being picked on for drug testing all the time.          Why then would a decision to order psychiatric testing qualify?                    Because it says, or any other.          Right?          Significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.                    The implication is that a decision to order psychiatric testing is a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or -- or working conditions.       It s always good to be safe.       And you -- you agree with the Government on that, that he can never get review of the statutory claim.        Oh, well.        Well, don t -- don t appeal to them on a -- on a point on which you don t agree with them.          I mean --
04-1140 +++$+++ 
04-1144 +++$+++         And you have another point here, don't you, about how general this statute is.      We don't normally interpret statutes this way, that they are totally invalid if any application of them would be unconstitutional.                That's not what we do with statutes normally, is it?        In the first amendment.         We're talking about a lawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the entire statute is invalid.               But that, when faced with an emergency of the sort that this discussion has addressed, the physician can go ahead and perform the abortion?         Quite a different lawsuit from this one.        Do you agree with Justice Breyer that the legislature can draw this with more precision than a court could?        I mean, that seems to be a solution, that the legislature can make it precise, although a court could not.           I thought there was a separate severability.             Didn't it have a severability provision?           And so it said just the opposite.          It said just the opposite, that if the health exception is no good, the rest of the statute would survive.            Isn't that basically --
04-1152 +++$+++        When you say that it asks what other employers receive, but these institutions, I gather, would not allow other employers, who have the same policy against the hiring of homosexuals, to interview at their institutions.                So, you're receiving what other employers in the same situation would receive.         No, but it seems me you've got us off galloping in the wrong direction.                  The statute doesn't require simply giving the same access that you give to other employers.                  It requires much more than that.           It requires that they -- it prohibits, or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military department from gaining access to campuses for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer. So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than simply you give the same access as all other employers. If you allow any other employer, you have to give it to the military in the same manner.         What does Title X of the United States Code deal with?         Why do you chose to defend this principally on the basis of the Spending Clause, and not on the basis of what it -- what it was, seemed to me, enacted in order to achieve, and that is the congressional power to raise and support armies.       It happens, in this case, to be specifically authorized by the Constitution.         You cannot convert a law into a law directed at the first -- at first-amendment rights, can you, by simply saying, "The reason I am disobeying it is to express -- whatever, disaffection with the war, my objection to homosexuality, or anything else -- or to homosexual discrimination -- or anything else"?           Does that convert it to a law directed against the first amendment?       You're not going to be an Army recruiter, are you? [Laughter.]       They're worried about having students driven off.           And if you have jeering and picketing, do you really think that that fulfills the purposes of this amendment?
04-1170 +++$+++        The State has made a judgment that this particular offense -- what's it called?        Aggravated murder, you know, whatever --       Capital murder, as its name implies, warrants a judgment of death unless there are mitigating factors that -- which indicate that that is not proper.       That's a moral judgment, isn't it?       And even if the State had said the opposite, it -- it is a -- still a State- prescribed moral judgment.             If the State had said capital murder warrants a judgment of death only if the mitigating factors outweigh the aggravating factors, that's still a State-prescribed moral judgment, isn't it?        The Furman narrowing is produced by the very first part of subsection (e).                    If, by a unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in -- in section 24-4625 and amendments thereto exist -- that's the Furman.        And then beyond that you say if that is found, then the jury has to find that the existence of such aggravating does not outweigh.       And then you throw the whole thing up in the air and say mercy alone is enough.                  I mean --
04-1186 +++$+++             Congress makes mistakes sometimes.          You -- you would say that the main office is the place where they're established. Is that what you think the word established refers to?          Well, I -- I think we need to go there, at least -- it seems strange to me that you have two different words and if, indeed, established means the same thing that you're telling us located means, I'm not going to agree with you.                    I mean, they're -- they're two different words --          Well, there I think the Fourth Circuit said we -- we had a case that resolved that.          I think the Fourth Circuit said that we had a case that -- that answered that question, not a case involving this particular provision --          -- but a case involving another provision of -- of the banking laws.          And you think a lawyer has to go back, in order to advise a client, and -- and when he has a word -- two words in -- in a provision -- one, established; the other, located -- he has to go back and figure out every one of these reenactments and inquire into, you know, what Congress meant at the time?          He -- he has -- he has a statute that says established in one part, located in another, and he has a Supreme Court case, which I mentioned, but you apparently disregard, which is Bougas, which --          Well, which -- when I asked about it, you -- you drew a blank.                    I mean, that's the case I was referring to.               And in -- which had a similar provision using the word established and located and said that established meant one thing and said what in this case it meant. Now, it was for a different purpose, to be sure, but if I were a lawyer looking up -- and it -- you know, it dealt with banks.                    And if -- if I were a -- a lawyer, I would have -- I would have said, gee, there it is.              The Supreme Court --            -- says where you have established and located in -- in the same provision, located means where they have a branch.            That may well be.          And -- and whatever -- whatever the outcome, whether it was equality or non- equality, and whatever the rationale, whether it was the purpose to be served or something else, the Court held that the word located in a banking statute which had both the words established and located in it --          -- meant where they have a branch.        And -- and that seems to me a very persuasive indication for a lawyer --          -- who's trying to figure out how to advise his client.         What did the Government argue in Bougas?          I -- I didn't look up the briefs in the case.          Did the Government appear in -- in that case?            And if we did -- if we did interpret 1332(c) that way, there wouldn't be any favoritism for national banks.
04-1203 +++$+++        General --       -- Clement, I'm interested in another statute that has applicability in the circumstances, and that's Section 1983 and the Prison Litigation Reform Act.           Under the -- under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, if you're bringing a constitutional claim under Section 1983, you have to exhaust your prison remedies before you can do that. And that is not the case here, is that right?        Do those violations that you allude to -- is there an extensive record of violations by the State of Georgia?       Well, you're --       But the money --       -- is not coming from the Nation, it's coming from the State of Georgia.               Was the State of Georgia guilty of constitutional violations?       No, no, my --       -- I mean a record -- a record that would have justified applying, against the State of Georgia, prophylactic measures.       Even against people who played no part in that nationwide record.         Was that before or after the enactment of this statute?        Well --        -- I'm looking at the --        -- at the chart in one of the amicus briefs, which shows that there are, for Georgia -- and it lists all the States -- for Georgia, zero arguable State violations prior to the Act.        The --        Well --        -- State and local violations.       But State and local units don't enjoy the sovereign immunity of the State.       You --       -- don't need this Act to sue them.        Why don't --        Why don't you need it for 1983 violations?       Constitutional violations. Not just prophylaxis --       -- but actual constitutional violations by the prisons under 1983 --       -- that don't happen to relate to the handicapped and, thus, are not covered by this legislation?         You can't get damages there.       Well, wait, but -- you know, in 1983, when you exhaust your prison remedies, the prison fixes what was wrong, and that's the end of it. But, under this Act, you go through your prison remedies, what do you ask the prison for?              Money?   The prison can't give you money, so they say, "No, you can't get your money."           I --       -- mean, the prison-remedy thing is -- the only thing it does is make it take a longer time to get to court, but it does the prison no good.       It's going to be liable for damages anyway.

Is that how we apply statutes, that if they may plausibly be read a certain way, that's what they mean?            I don't understand how that's a resolution of the question.          I don't understand how they -- how they could dispose of the case without resolving that. That's my puzzlement.          How -- I mean, can we do that in a case that comes up here, and just say, "There are good arguments on both sides, it's quite plausible," and remand the case without resolving the issue? [Laughter.]       Except if they think we didn't know what we were doing.            I --       -- they ignore it if they -- if they think that we didn't know what we were doing.

Mr. Landau, I d like to know how you read section 2.                What -- what meaning do you give to a written provision in a contract?       I -- I guess that respondent uses the language in the way it -- he says it should be used when he refers to a contract that is void ab initio.        There s no such thing as a contract that is void ab initio, is there?       If you take the meaning of contract that he takes in section 2.
04-1324 +++$+++         Or the other side may say, "Although technically the statute of limitations applied here, taking all considerations into account we think that this prisoner acted with reasonable promptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat attributable to the State."              Do you think that that's a proper consideration?        But you -- it could be argued that the Federal Government wants to move them along speedily, whether or not the State government wants to.        So, that would suggest that the State's voluntary waiver of a statute of limitations should not make any difference.               It's a Federal -- it's a Federal interest involved, not a State interest.          Why does -- proceeding under 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this way does?        Wink, wink?        I mean, there is some value in that, I think, particularly where the State has expressly conceded timeliness.               I mean, the magistrate judge in this case, all that he had before him was the express concession from the State.                    He never -- the State never said anything in the District Court, even after he issued his notice to the Petitioner to show cause why it wasn't untimely.               So, the magistrate judge, all he had before him was the State's position that it was timely.        Must there be good reasons for the judge to say, quote, "I'm surprised that you haven't raised a statute of limitations defense"?        Must there be good reason for that?         And, if not, aren't you asking us to waste our time?        Why don't you do it the easier way and --         Well, what's your answer as to whether there is any limitation on the judge just suggesting, "By the way, you know, is there some reason why you haven't pleaded statute of limitations?"          Can a -- can a judge do that?         And what -- when would it be an abuse of discretion?         Yes.         Right.           So, you'd say it would be okay if the State didn't expressly concede the statute of limitations point.        That's --        That's what I thought your --        -- position was.        Okay.     So, this --        -- a fallback position.
04-1327 +++$+++           Now, there's some dispute as to whether that -- that is really what -- what it held. And there's a big difference.                If -- if you just say whenever you -- whenever the prosecution has a strong case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all that the court is saying is that one of the elements that you consider in determining whether to admit this -- this third party is not just -- it's the comparative weakness of the third party case.                 You don't blind yourself to -- to the strength of the prosecution's case. Will you say it was bad even if it was the latter that the court was -- was referring to?                 Are you saying you cannot consider the strength of the prosecution's case at all in determining whether to allow in third party guilt evidence?            You think -- you think there's no difference where really very questionable evidence about some third party's guilt is -- is produced in a case where -- where the State's case barely makes it over the -- over the line to get to the jury and you think it's -- it's the same call where that barely questionable third party evidence is -- is put in in opposition to a State's case that is -- is watertight -- I mean, you know, forensic evidence, all sorts of proof.        You -- you think the two have to be treated the same.            Does the other side agree with that?             I -- I'd be surprised if that were the law in the other 49 jurisdictions, that the judges just blind themselves to the -- to the prosecution's case when they make these calls.        What's your authority for -- for the -- for opposition that every other jurisdiction does it that way?           We're not arguing about that.       I -- I don't think anybody has asked you that question.         The question is whether you can consider it at all, and -- and you say no.          Not -- not harmless you mean.
04-1329 +++$+++        Mr. Pincus, you -- you had a second point you were going -- in response to Justice Breyer's question.        What was your second point?       Isn't the refutation of the presumption really the same thing as a demonstration of market power?       And -- and we usually leave the demonstration of market power to the -- to the plaintiff in the case.       So it -- it'd be rather strange to -- to have in this one category of cases the market power has to be -- or lack of market power has to be demonstrated by the defendant.
04-1332 +++$+++          So do I. (Laughter.)         It's certainly broader -- it's certainly broader than res judicata anyway, isn't it?      Because if the Government -- suit against the Government is dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, what would be res judicata is only the jurisdictional question, and -- and this doesn't -- this goes beyond that, doesn't it?       Go -- go through that again, would you?       The thing you haven't answered that I think is troubling everybody is why is -- why is that -- I mean, if you could come up with some explanation of why that concern for morale only arises after there has been a -- a judgment in the suit against the Government.           Why -- if that were the concern and if the Government wanted total immunity, why wouldn't they have extended it to a -- a 1983 suit brought before the FTCA suit?       Give me a good reason for that.
04-1350 +++$+++              How does -- how does motivation enter into that analysis in that case?                    How would you, how would you have applied the motivation?                      I -- like Justice Breyer, I don't understand what the motivation -- motivation element is.                    How would you have applied the --             He had no particular motivation to use that earlier patent, did he?             Mr. Hungar, I have a question that's sort of along the lines of Justice Ginsburg's.    It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has been applying this test.          It's also the Patent Office and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for 20 years or so. What, what is -- assuming that we sweep that test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to the presumption of validity of, of patents which the courts have been, have been traditionally applying? Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid which have been issued under an erroneous test for the last 20 years?
04-1360 +++$+++         I don't know, I'd be worried -- you know, bust in somebody's door -- that the homeowner wouldn't shoot me.                 Without announcing that I'm the police, he had every reason to believe he's under attack.         Isn't that a considerable deterrent?        Exactly.        Right.        Yes.        I'm not sure I agree with a point that you make in your brief that civil actions simply are of no use.               That might have been the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule, but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by prisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of these cases are successful below.                 What reason is there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate deterrent?        Of course, that same problem exists if the consequence is exclusion of evidence.         Courts are going to view it the same way. You're not going to avoid that problem by excluding evidence.        Well --        Well, I mean, your point is, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long enough, right?         And that's why they don't win a lot of these cases.        But the same thing is going to be true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is the exclusion of the evidence.               The court is going to be very -- it's going to be very difficult to tell if they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court is likely to say, you know, "Let it go."        Our two cases did not -- did not raise that issue.             The issue was not decided in those cases, was it?        Right.   	 Yes, but here it was a warrant to enter the home, not to seize particular goods.       So, the entry of the home was not illegal. The entering of the home was perfectly okay.                  What was illegal was not knocking and announcing in advance.         It seems to me that's quite a different -- quite a different issue, and the causality is quite different.          I understand that, but the essence of the violation was not the entering; whereas, in the cases, the old common law cases you're talking about, the essence of the violation was the entering.           Here, the entering was perfectly okay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give the advance notice, that made it bad.                   And that, it seems to me, creates a different situation.        Mr. Moran, these old common law cases you referred to, which held that a failure to knock and announce renders the entry unlawful, what was the consequence, in those cases?        Right.      And the evidence would -- if found, was not excluded, right?           So, if we wanted to be faithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't exclude the evidence.           Well, then you shouldn't have cited the common law case. [Laughter.]        Well, I suppose there are a lot of other violations of constitutional rights by the police that are very hard to get at, and that cannot be remedied.           And I suppose we could punish them by excluding all the evidence, as well.            We don't do so, simply because there's no causality.              We insist upon a causal connection between the two. It's not enough just to say the -- this is the only way to stop the police from making the violation.            What about our opinion in Ramirez, where the manner of entry was such that there was damage to property?            We didn't exclude the evidence there, did we?           Well, what had happened? Had they broken a window on the way in?                  Is that --           Well, the entry remains lawful, despite the fact that the manner of the entry, which included the breaking of a window, was unlawful.         I think what the Court meant was not, as you're portraying it, that, objectively, the entry was lawful.            I think they were speaking: as a matter of law, despite the fact that the breaking of the window was wrong, the entry was lawful.                  Just as your opponent is saying here: despite the fact that there was no knock-and-announce, the entry was lawful.         I thought the Government's distinction was based on the fact that they were arrest cases.          I thought that's the distinction they were making.
04-1371 +++$+++             Mr. Kasner, the -- does the Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement authority in this -- in this area?            Have they issued any rules or regulations on this -- on this point?        On the point that you're arguing, whether the critical language means the person's own sale, or not --        Is it your position that we owe deference to the interpretation of the SEC?        I mean, that's --         I always thought "the" meant "the." [Laughter.]         And "his or her" means "his or her."
04-1376 +++$+++            But why should that --            -- why should that make a difference as to whether it's retroactive or not?                   I mean, if it -- it seems to me you look to the activity that it governs.             And the activity that it governs is the deportation or removal from now on. Now, you could argue that -- if you want, that there are some due process violations in making that prospective law affect past activities as they do. I mean, let's -- one of the examples given in Landgraf, or at least in my concurrence in Landgraf, was a change of the law procedure so that expert testimony, which previously was not admissible, is now admissible.              Now, the person who committed the crime that's involved in the next case that comes up when that new procedural rule is applied, he can say, "Well, you know, you've changed -- you've changed the rules on me.      When I committed the crime, the expert testimony wasn't admissible.             Now it is admissible.        That's not fair."       Well, whether it's fair or not is something we can inquire into under the due process clause, but nobody would say that that procedural change is retroactive.             And it --            -- seems to me that's what's going on here.         That wasn't my point.          My point --         -- was, you look to the -- to the activity which is governed by the new law.                      In the case of the -- of the expert testimony, the activity governed is the trial, so that law applies prospectively to all future trials.                      So, also, in this case, this law applies prospectively to all future removals, QED.           It is not retroactive.             Now, you may have an argument, although I don't think it's a very good one, that there are due process problems involved in this prospective law.              But I don't see how you can call the law retroactive.        That doesn't affect --        -- doesn't affect his reentry at all.          His reentry occurred.          It -- how could it possibly have anything to do with his reentry?        That would apply new penalties to the reentry.             This law does not apply any new penalties to the reentry, it just -- it just establishes a new regime for removing the person who has reentered.       Yes, but --           -- I think that's because they were using the version of stage one that you are using, which includes, in the consideration of whether Congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the -- whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I understand it, should be left to stage two, exclusively.           Your analysis in your brief mingles the two.             It says one of the factors that you can take into account in stage one is whether it's retroactive.             And as I -- I don't understand Landgraf to speak that way.             I thought you were supposed to use all other indicia of legislative intent, other than the normal rule against retroactivity, in deciding congressional intent, and then you go to stage two, which is where retroactivity comes in.         Yes, but as the Government points out, that "either before or after" applied to when you had been deported --        -- not to when you reentered.          And what we're -- what you're arguing for here is a rule that goes from the time of reentry, not from the time of deportation.               So, it's not really a parallel.            I wish we could get some new vocabulary.              Terminology is destiny, and I really don't follow the discussion of speaking about whether it was prospective or retroactive.                  I don't think, whichever way it applied, it is retroactive.                  But the issue still remains, Did Congress intend pre-IIRIRA reentries to be covered or not?          I --        -- I would consider that still prospective, but just note my --        -- that I don't --        -- go along with you when you force this terminology on me, whether Congress intended it to be retroactive.                As I see it, the issue is whether Congress intended it to apply to reentries that occurred before IIRIRA was enacted.                   I would not consider that retroactive, but it's still an open question what Congress intended.       -- attitude for Congress to have.           Not only the --           -- disincentives.           They were trying to get out of the country people who were here illegally, two-time losers who were here illegally for the second time.       Why would he think that? Why wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is subject to being deported under such rules as the country has for deporting people who are here illegally, whatever they may be, from time to time? That would be my expectation if I came in illegally, in violation of the law.           I'm saying, "I'm here at the sufferance of the country.             I shouldn't be here.       And whatever rules they have for kicking me out are the rules that I'll have to abide by."       "I'm lucky not to be in jail."
04-1414 +++$+++        I suppose that a warrant like a -- like a contract has a -- a reasonable life. Don't you think a warrant expires if it does not have a concluding date?         You think it goes on forever and ever and ever?         Don't you think a warrant just lasts a reasonable time?       Even -- even if the warrant did not specifically say that it was an anticipatory warrant and that -- and that you can only execute it after the delivery?        But I thought that's supposed to be a -- a magistrate's determination.        Mr. Dreeben, could -- could I ask you if the Government would -- would defend a -- an anticipatory warrant in these circumstances?                   The postal inspectors know that the unlawful video has been put in the mail and they know that it -- it is going to one of 17 individuals.            They're not sure which one of the 17.        So they go and get a warrant that says, you know -- and -- and it will be obvious in my hypothesis that the delivery of the video has occurred.              So can they get a warrant that says you can go in -- it lists all of these 17 people.           And it says you can go into their premises as soon as you see delivery of the video.       Would -- would you support that kind of an anticipatory warrant?       Well, then -- then -- well, I'm sorry to hear you say that because then you are really not saying that there has to be probable cause.       Because at the outset there's no probable cause to believe that any one of those 17 -- unless you think one-seventeenth is enough for probable cause.       Yes.       Yes, but I'm not talking about a particular location.               I'm talking about we know it's going to be one of 17 -- or make it 50, if you like.       We don't know which of those.       We want a warrant that will let us go in immediately when we see it delivered. Would you support that warrant?       Yes.     It's in somebody's home.       It's into a home.        Yes, but you don't want us to decide the case on that ground.                  I mean --       It is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual.                 That probability exists at the time that the warrant is -- is issued.       And that's the probable cause you're relying on.       It is probable that this package will be delivered to this individual.          Mr. Dreeben, a quick yes or no.      Does the Government concede that when you have an anticipatory warrant, the warrant is not properly executed until the -- the anticipated event occurs?
04-1477 +++$+++          Mr. Kirkpatrick, I don't recall what -- what the rule is.                   Does notice have to be given by registered mail?                  Would it -- would it be adequate notice in the -- in the ordinary case to send notice by regular mail?           Yes, but do we have a case that says that, you have to use registered mail?           I didn't think we did.         And it would seem to me that especially when you have the taxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it would be a denial of due process to send notice by regular mail to that address.                   And if -- if that satisfies due process, the State would never have known that it did not reach the individual.        And it seems -- it seems mean to punish the State for going the extra mile and sending the notice by registered mail because that informed them that it didn't reach him.          Would this case come out differently?           You know, your client had an obligation to keep the State informed of -- of his -- his address so that they could send the tax bills to him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer does not keep the State advised of his current address, any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will suffice for all purposes.           Suppose it said that explicitly.            Would that -- would that make this case come out differently?           Why?     I mean, the State can punish people for not doing what the law tells them to do, and here the State is saying we tell you to keep us -- you keep us advised of your -- your address.                   If you don't, I guess we could throw you in jail for half a year, but no, we're not going to do that.                  We're just going to say that -- that your -- your punishment for violating the law is that this kind of a notice will suffice.           Well, but there -- no, but this is a consequence of violating the law of -- of Arkansas.         Certainly the State can impose consequences for violating its law.        You know, and my next question is going to be, if you say it would come out differently, then isn't -- isn't it sort of silly to make the State go on and say that?                    If they could do the same thing by simply reciting what's going to happen, why -- why should we make them do that?        Could they fine him for not -- could they fine him for not -- for not keeping them advised of -- of where -- where his tax address is?        They could.        Suppose they could.       Right. Could they fine him -- how much money did you lose here?        Could they fine him $70,000?        It's pretty harsh, but do you think this Court would strike it down?        You do.
04-1495 +++$+++         But you're willing to acknowledge -- and -- and the Government concedes that you can have a different standard when the -- the basis for the selective prosecution happens to violate the Constitution from the standard you apply where the basis for the selective prosecution doesn't violate the Constitution, such as I'm prosecuting him because he was mean to my brother-in-law.               Okay?        Are you going to apply a different standard there than you would apply where -- where the reason is some First Amendment reason?       But would you answer my question?       It's going be a different criterion -- you -- you say it's going to be different for the First Amendment and the -- and -- and the Equal Protection Clause, at least where race is involved. What if there's no constitutional violation at all, but I just selectively prosecute him just because I don't like this guy or because he was mean to a relative of mine?         Is there going to be a different standard --         Exactly, and would you apply a different standard because there isn't a constitutional claim?        That's what I'm asking.           Mr. Kneedler, the defendant here is not the prosecutor.                 Right?           Just someone who provided information to the prosecutor that -- that was erroneous and allegedly maliciously motivated.           Allegedly maliciously motivated, at least. I don't understand how you would apply the test, would -- you know, would you have prosecuted anyway, when -- you know, but for the malicious motive, when the person you're -- you're suing is not the prosecutor.            It wasn't up to this person whether there would be a prosecution.

I'd like to hear what they are.       Excuse me.        I really didn't understand that argument.            Does the State deduct from its Medicaid funds the amount that it pays lawyers to conduct Medicaid litigation?       Well, then it doesn't matter as far as the Medicaid funds are concerned.                  It comes out of general State revenues.               Right?

At least where the reason the candidate would have to spend so much time is the very small contribution limit established by the same statute.          It's -- it's rather like the -- the murderer asking for mercy because he's an orphan, having killed his parents.        And we -- we didn't send it back so that more of a record could be made, did we?        Well, but you know.        You expect them to name names?             I mean, here -- (Laughter.)        Really, that -- that's -- that's a lot to ask.        Only -- only the most corruptible. (Laughter.)            Well, it would also prevent the candidate himself from expending his entire fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he should be elected --            -- think that's okay.        Which raises no possibility of corruption.        I don't know what you mean they have an exception for the wealthy family.           Excuse me.      What -- what amounts were suspiciously large?           I don't understand how that comes.       How does that come about?
04-1544 +++$+++         Any exception whatever.        So if -- if the contention in the -- in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the will which has been probated by the State probate court is, in fact, not the true will and that under the true will, the bankruptcy estate would get money, you think the bankruptcy court would -- would have jurisdiction to probate the will.        All right.      Well, I'm willing to -- to move it back.               I mean, that's -- that's even harder for you.               But let's assume that the will is in probate but has not yet been probated.                    Do you think the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to decide which will is the true will?        Yes or no.        All right.            Do you want to stand on this position, Mr. Richland, or do you have a lesser position --            -- that -- that might cause you to win?             Because -- (Laughter.)         But you could say the same thing about diversity jurisdiction, that Congress contemplated that there would be diversity jurisdiction where there was no bankruptcy jurisdiction and no Federal question jurisdiction.                I mean, I don't see what that proves.         I'm just saying no more so than -- than when Congress enacted diversity jurisdiction.          It intended it to apply, you know, uniformly.         Yes.         That's true.           You want to look moderate.        What do you mean by no jurisdiction to probate a will?                Could -- could -- does that exclude the possibility of a bankruptcy court deciding for itself where there are contested wills that in its in view the -- the right -- the valid will is a certain one and that, therefore, the bankruptcy estate includes this fund or doesn't include this fund? Is that probating the will?        Well, if that isn't probating a will, the exception for probating a will doesn't -- doesn't amount to a hill of beans, does it?        Yes.        Well, and that this is -- that this is the -- the last will and testament and that there is not some other one.        Okay.     Now, can -- can the bankruptcy court determine that, that the -- that the proper will and testament of this decedent is this one? We're not probating it.           No, no.        We don't pretend to probate it.     We're just saying that this happens to be the true will and testament.        We could just say whatever its scope is it ain't this.               I mean, couldn't we do that?
04-1581 +++$+++           I -- I don't -- I don't understand what you just said.          No, but I mean, once it didn't come to a head in November and it was still an issue, why didn't you continue to run it?          Mr. Bopp, did -- did the opinion refer to --          -- sham ads?          Did the opinion refer to --
04-1618 +++$+++            Well -- I -- I guess, in -- in going beyond the Eleventh Amendment, we were appealing to an understanding of sovereignty that existed at the time of the framing.           And at the time of the framing, counties in England did not enjoy the -- the sovereign immunity of the king, did they?        Do you -- do you agree that -- that it's possible that an entity can have sovereign immunity in admiralty where -- where the same entity would -- would not have it elsewhere?        I find that discussion quite perplexing.       They're talking about immunity in most of the cases, not necessarily --       -- not necessarily sovereign immunity.       Hans -- Hans is residual sovereign immunity.       Some -- some of our brethren don't -- don't agree with it.              They don't like the residue and would limit it to the Eleventh Amendment.       If you're going to have a residue, Hans is it I suppose.        Nor could charities.     They were immune as well.          But it -- it certainly wasn't sovereign immunity.          The question presented is -- is only sovereign immunity, isn't it?                     It's -- we don't have to decide whether there might be some other type of immunity.            I always thought the governmental proprietary distinction really came up in State law cases involving municipal liability.                     That's principally where it --
04-1704 +++$+++        You think there has to be somebody who can challenge it, though.        Some of our opinions say that, don't they, that --        -- it's not necessarily true that there has to be --        In any case, it's clear that that -- that that entity no longer has standing, isn't it?        Yes.        But they don't --        But they don't -- I mean, I thought the assumption here is that they don't have standing.         The --        The former standing of Kim's Auto cannot allow this suit to proceed, under any theory --        -- can it?        Don't you have to have standing during the entire --        -- process --        Yes, but the only person who could give them standing, even by this associational theory, is gone.        But --        But they are not property taxpayers who have standing under any -- under the argument that you've just made.        The only property-tax individual who had standing was somebody whose land had been condemned.          None of these other people in it have had their land condemned --       -- have they?       Whose land has been condemned.       Well, but --       -- but you say that a property taxowner, simply by being -- simply by being subject to the property tax, does not having standing. Isn't that your position?           There's also a redressability problem, too, isn't there?                    I mean, assuming they could, is there any -- would action against the Assembly eliminate their tax?           No?          And the credit's available to out-of-State companies.       You don't believe in harmonization, Mr. Olson? [Laughter.]
04-1739 +++$+++        Can we explain that?         How does one use a newspaper as a weapon?                       I mean, you know, maybe disciplining a dog or something. (Laughter.)           Do -- do you concede that just because a right is enumerated, it means it cannot be entirely taken away in prison?           I mean, like, you know, try the right to bear arms. (Laughter.)       Mr. Rovelli, do the other prisoners know about this?             I'd like you to respond to the -- to the assertion that nobody knows about this anyway, so it doesn't deter anybody.
04-373 +++$+++       Ms. Graeff, is there any case which says that an initiation is not voluntary, as opposed to a confession being not voluntary, because the suspect has been charged with a crime greater than what the police believe they can prove, or if the police advise him that he's been charged with a greater crime than what he's really been charged with? Is there any case which says that the effect of that is to cause his initiation of discussion to be involuntary?        The --        -- improper statement was, "I bet you want to talk now, huh?"      Right?     And --      -- immediately, the other detective, Johns -- immediately?        Said what?         You're saying that those facts could not reasonably be found to be -- to produce a situation in which the defendant believed he would be hounded to talk, so he said, "What the heck, I'll talk."         Which is what Edwards is directing.         That no factfinder -- and this is mixed fact and law -- could reasonably come to that conclusion.         When it -- when one of the -- the last he had heard from the officers was, "No, he doesn't want to talk.       He already asked for a lawyer.               We cannot talk to him now."         You're saying no reasonable judge could find that that defendant thought he would be hounded.        It has nothing to do with whether the defendant thinks he is going to be hounded.        It has --        -- to do with --      -- with whether --      -- the defendant thinks he will be badgered and badgered until he finally talks.      Which is what Edwards is directed at.
04-433 +++$+++         Well, I don't understand your answer then.         I mean -- I mean, does the fact that -- that there was classic mob violence involved make a difference or not?        Why?     I -- your answer didn't -- didn't tell me why.        Well, that has nothing to do with violence or not.           It has to do with directness or not.      You're saying you would apply the same directness test.            I'm -- I'm impressed by one of the cases cited in the brief, in which someone causes a person who has a contract with a third party to believe that the third party has repudiated the contract, and thereby gets that person to give the contract to himself.              Now, in that case, the person defrauded is the other party to the contract, not the -- not the third party.                And yet, I suspect the third party would -- would be direct enough to be -- to be within the protected scope, don't you think?            And yet, he's not defrauded.            All right.        But it -- it at least contradicts your assertion that you have to be the defrauded party.              You acknowledge that sometimes you don't have to be the defrauded party.
04-473 +++$+++            I suppose that, in the situation the Chief Justice mentioned, the professor would still be able to contend that the university fired him because it disagreed with the political content of his speech or because of the university's politics.                   He could still make that claim, couldn't he?           But the --           -- burden would be on him, as it would be in most cases --           -- to show that that was true.           Whereas, the Ninth Circuit would put it on the -- put the burden on the university to show that it wasn't true.           I guess if your job is to speak truth, and you speak falsehood, that's a good reason to fire you, which is what happened here.           You don't have to establish that he was lying; just that his prediction -- his job, was to predict, and he made a -- an erroneous -- a false prediction.          Don't have to show that he intended to do that.           Excuse me, I'm not sure I understood the answer to the first question, John.                  Was he not fired because he had made an improper assessment?           Yes.           Right.           And your defense is that the --            -- actions were not taken with any reference to this -- to this at all.           But that's surely a --           -- surely a factual inquiry, which will be disputed.               If you want to win on summary judgment, it seems to me you have to establish that, assuming he was fired because of this speech, that would be -- or not promoted because of his speech -- that would be perfectly okay.           That's where --           -- we are.           We assume --           -- that that was the reason for the later actions.           What if the reason -- what if the reason for the -- for firing him is that he's a Democrat and it's a Republican Administration, and the speech is used as the pretext?        And I suppose that what constitutes a matter of public interest is not the clearest line in the world either, is it?
04-52 +++$+++        General, does -- does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike was, or does the judge have to find what the reason for the strike wasn t?       And if there are several allegations and -- and each of them is somewhat doubtful but, on balance, he says, I give the benefit of the -- of the doubt to the -- to the district attorney, it s his indication that, as a matter of fact, he finds that the reason wasn t race.       No.     You have to accept his hypothetical as he gave it.             Assuming that the attorney, the district attorney, was in good faith.       Yes.     Assuming that the -- the attorney did not think that he or she was striking the juror because of the juror s race.            That -- that gives a lot of power to district -- to -- to the district judge, doesn t it?              I mean, you know, this -- he says this -- this U.S. attorney really doesn t honestly believe that he s biased, but I think, being the great psychologist that I am, that this United States attorney, or whoever, is -- is really biased and -- and he s -- I -- you really --            -- you really want the system to run that way?
04-593 +++$+++ 
04-597 +++$+++          And that determination of what was the weight of the evidence is typically left to the trial judge, rather than to the Court of Appeals.                It would be --         -- somewhat novel for the Court of Appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of what it thought the weight of the evidence was.                It's one thing to say, "If he's denied or granted a motion for a new trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of discretion," but for the appellate court to do that de novo and assess the weight of the evidence, it seems, to me, quite unusual.        Well --        -- it seems --        -- it seems to me that if the Court of Appeals is going to grant a new trial, it must say one of two things.            It must say either, number one, "There was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but the conclusion of that determination ought to be -- and, therefore, you know, the case is over"; but to say that and then say, "And, therefore, we give a new trial," it seems very strange.          Or else, the Court of Appeals has to say, you know, "The weight of the evidence was not in the plaintiff's favor."             And if it says that, it's making the kind of a determination that I find unusual for a Court of Appeals.            I suppose they could make the same -- if -- I mean, if that follows, they should be able to do the same thing when there has been no motion made, neither before nor after, right?                    They could say, "Well, there's no motion made.                We really have no authority to reverse this judgment."            "But" --            -- you know, "we certainly think there was not enough evidence, and, therefore, we grant a new trial."              Does any court do that?            Where no motion has been made --            -- neither before the verdict nor after the verdict, does any appellate court say, "Since no motion was made, we have -- we have no power to reverse the judgment here, but our examination of the case indicates that there was really not sufficient evidence to go to the jury.              And, therefore, we will do the lesser thing and grant a new trial"?                   Does any court of -- appellate court do that?        What is the usual practice with regard to the pre-verdict motions?                 Are -- is the initial one made at the close of the plaintiff's case --        -- and then renewed at the -- at the end of all of the evidence?        Yes.        But they're really different things to be reviewed at those two times.                    I mean, at the end of all the evidence, there may be some matter that the defendant inadvertently puts in that makes up the deficiency in the plaintiff's case.                     So, it's really a different motion, isn't it?           Of relief.          Yes, well, I don't know that you have to read it that way.                 I mean, you can say that the -- when the -- when the rule says that it -- that it is deemed to have been reserved, it also implies that the question that was reserved is implicitly resolved when the court does not -- does, later, not act.                    It's an implicit denial.        Why can't you read the rule that way?        I'm not sure --        -- I understood.    Sorry.    Just -- I'm not sure I understood.               Did you say that even when it's reserved, the judge cannot go back to the reserved motion and grant it unless the motion is renewed?         Do you agree on the answer -- with the answer to the last question I asked?                 Can -- on a 50(a) motion, can a judge grant a new trial instead of granting judgment?         I didn't.

It definitely goes that far, isn't definiteness fully satisfied?           No?        I could see how that broad interpretation would raise perhaps for the -- clearly raise for the first time the section 101 issue.                    But, so that should have been clear to you by the time the court of appeals decision came out, right?                But did you, in your petition here, rely on 101?        You never mentioned 101, though, did you?       Why shouldn't we do what the Solicitor General proposed, that is, since we don't know for sure, at least I don't know for sure, I'm not enough of a scientist --       -- whether in fact the section 112 determination, as made by the Federal court, excludes all other possible use of this natural phenomenon. Since I don't know that for sure, why shouldn't I tell the Federal Circuit, you know, your definition of correlate raises this issue and you should resolve whether it is true that there is no other possible usefulness for this, no substantial usefulness?        Okay.

Why did --        -- they ever put that provision in, unless it means something different from --           Mr. Olson, you mentioned Section 3410.

Aren't there usually two incidents?          You talk about the incident of the taxes on a person, but it's also on an event.                 And what event is -- in your -- in your judgment is --
04-698 +++$+++         Excuse me.      Why didn't it?    I -- why wasn't the APA applicable?        I see.        I see.         So --         -- what it if were -- what it were a school on a Federal base?                   Are they covered by this Act, by the way?          You know --         -- military schools on military --         DOD schools.        What do you do with them? 	 Are they governed by the APA?         No?         Well, you'd be suing some Federal agency.           I mean, it has to be some Federal agency that's running that school, and at least for that kind of a school the burden is clearly going to be on the person challenging the agency action.          I understand the purposes-of- the-statute argument.             The purpose of the statute is always to provide relief to someone who's been injured. And to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden should be on the other side, in order -- in order that people who are injured can get relief, is -- I mean --          -- that will always be the case.          That's fine.   I -- that's one sort of relief.           But, I mean, you have some relief at issue under every statute.               They want a needy person to be given justice.            And to say that, since that's their purpose, you should always put the burden on the other side, is -- I just don't understand that argument.        Sure.        And the Federal Tort Claims Act, for all I know, says, in its prologue -- or, if it doesn't, it should have, or it could have -- the purpose of this is to assure that every person who's been injured by a -- by a Government tort obtains relief.        What sense does it make for the parents to tell that to the school system?               I mean --        It's only play money, right?           Mr. Hurd, here's --           -- here's my problem with your assertion that we have to decide it in the way that furthers the purposes of the statute.                       We said, in other cases -- and correctly, I think -- that no statute pursues its purpose at all costs, that there are limitations upon its purpose.              It, of course, wants students who need this special help to get it, but it also does not want students who don't need this special help to get it.                      And for you to say, "There's no harm done."                   You know, "If he -- if he's given it when he doesn't need it.                      What's the problem?         He goes to a better school."               The problem is that this is not play money.                   It's coming from somewhere; and, namely, on the citizens who have to pay for it.        For each hearing or -- for each hearing or just --        Oh.        Oh.        I think it would be more realistic to divide it by the number of hearings, rather than by the number of heads.
04-712 +++$+++ 
04-721 +++$+++        Isn't it --       -- worse than that?       Would --       Yes.     Well this --       -- this case is different, actually, from the one that Justice Breyer put, because, in this case, the California Supreme Court didn't say --         -- "on the merits."      It said nothing at all.           It just disposed of it.         So, the question presented is quite different.         It's whether -- not whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they say "on the merits," but whether it can be, nonetheless, timely when they don't say anything at all.         I would think it's an a fortiori case, in other words.       Under our current law, it wouldn't make any difference, would it?                   Because even if they sent the "on the merits" postcard, Carey versus Saffold says --       -- it doesn't matter.           Well, in this --           -- in this case, in order to determine it was untimely, they would have presumably had to have gone into the factual analysis of whether the prison was on lockdown, whether he delayed for a year after getting the materials, and all of that stuff.        So, it's a lot easier for them, when the merits of it seem to them absolutely clear, to simply deny it on the merits and not reach the "timely" question.        But the "timely" question is still before Federal Courts.               That's what we said in Carey versus Saffold.           So --        -- although they can avoid it, we can't.            Why phrase it as a presumption?              Why not phrase it, "We determine California law to be, unless we hear otherwise, having examined what it does in other situations, that 60 days is timely"?            It's the same thing.     But I wouldn't call it --            -- a presumption.            And then --            -- and then the -- you know, the incarcerated individual can come forward with excuses and say that, "California would make an exception to the 60-day rule for this," and we're back where we were.        Is "reasonable time" the issue, or is it what California would consider a "reasonable time"?          I mean, that's the problem.        We're not --        -- making up, for ourselves, what's a reasonable time.             If California says a year is a reasonable time, that would be the reasonable time at issue, wouldn't it?       No, but if --       -- the California Supreme Court says, "Despite all of these, in this kind of a situation, we think a year is a reasonable time" --       -- you --       I know, but if they said so --       -- that would be binding --       -- on us, wouldn't it?
04-759 +++$+++         I really don't understand the -- are you sure that a failure to execute a statute does not come within the language, "an act or omission," in the execution of a statute?            I would think a total failure to execute is an omission in the execution of the statute.        You mean if you executed 90 percent and omit 10 percent of what you're supposed to do, it comes within that language, but if you don't execute at all, it doesn't?          That seems to me most unlikely.        I mean it seems to me --        Yes. Well, you --        -- you accepted, it seemed to me, the premise of --        -- Justice Souter's question, which is that (a) -- 2680(a) only applies to a failed execution.          There has to be at least an attempted execution.          I'm not sure that's true.               It says "an act or omission" in the execution.                 And I think a total -- I just don't do the thing at all.                 I think that's an omission in the execution.           I --           Well, I wouldn't do that.        Saying that there is no private-party analog is not quite the same thing as saying you lose under what we consider to be the proper private- party analog -- namely, Good Samaritan.        Which the court of appeals hasn't done.
04-805 +++$+++         Well, do you acknowledge that the rule of reason analysis of the -- of the initial formation can include a rule of reason analysis of whether it -- it would violate the -- the Sherman Act to -- to have the new entity price both products the same?        You could say you -- you just never get beyond step one.                You don't go any further if there's no market power.
04-848 +++$+++        Well, I guess we've already construed it broadly, haven't we, in -- or, excuse me -- yes, construed the waiver broadly.                In Kosak versus United States, we allowed a suit against the United States for negligence of a mail truck in an automobile accident.                     I suppose the language could have covered that, couldn't it?         It could --         -- have been within the literal.         It could have been negligent -- what is it? -- negligence --         -- in the delivery of mail?         Yes.       It could cover, under your theory, this very act, just dumping the stuff there on the porch, if the consequence of that had not been that the homeowner tripped over it, but that rain destroyed the contents of the -- of the letters so that they were illegible.       You would --       -- say that that would --       -- be covered.       So, in -- it seems to me a little strange that this same act is both within the exception and not within the exception, the same act of negligence.       That is a good answer.   I'm glad you came up with that. [Laughter.]            Right.              I think --              -- I think you're covered.              I think that's negligence transmission.       Excuse me --       -- I don't understand your last -- your last answer.            You think bopping somebody on the head in the course of delivering a package would --       Okay.       Well, you -- the -- you assert that would be the case, don't you?       I mean, you assert that they would be able to sue.       Oh.    All right.            Yes.            Okay.     I gotcha.
04-881 +++$+++           Did -- are -- just as an initial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a future Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law that says, you know, "In the future, no statute shall have X effect unless it says" -- and then it writes in a phrase that has to be said?          And then you have a future Congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute that does not use the magic words.                   I thought our cases held that, in such a situation, the will of the future Congress prevails --          -- so long as it's clearly expressed.
04-885 +++$+++          Bankruptcy Clause presumably does not allow Congress to set up the bankruptcy law in such a way that it would amount to a taking of property without just compensation, right?          Wouldn't allow another constitution to be violated.        So the only question here is whether the constitutional protection of States' sovereign immunity can be taken away by the Bankruptcy Clause; whereas, other provisions clearly can't, right?          To say -- to say that the State can't be sued is not the same thing as saying that the State can sue, is it?         You --          -- you can prevent the State from suing, even though you can't sue the State.                 There's no incompatibility, is there?         I suppose you could say that a -- the intangible of a contract claim is part of the estate, too, right?      It's --         But, I mean, you could be -- there's no less reason to say that that's part of the res than there is to say that the preferential transfer is.         Well, I suppose you could have a contract action that -- in which the State promises to turn over a particular parcel of land that it owns, or even, for that matter, a gold bar that is on somebody's -- some State functionary's desk.           And I guess you could have a suit for that gold bar or for the piece of property.                 And I guess you could call that an in rem action, if you wanted to.                But it wouldn't be.          What about a rescission action in which the private party has conveyed property to the State, and the State doesn't pay, and the private party seeks to rescind the action and to receive back the property that it turned over, which is real estate or a gold bar?                 Could that not --          -- not be a -- characterized as an in rem action?            He's seeking back the property he gave over.         Against the entire State --         -- including any money owed to the other -- to the other State institutions.                  You acknowledged that that --         -- offset could be --         -- applied not just against the college here, but against the --         -- other entities.         We couldn't decide it in your favor, on some alternative ground, though, could we? [Laughter.]         Well, I mean, that distinguishes it --         The difference between this and Hood.
04-8990 +++$+++         The district court heard that, though, didn't it?        And didn't believe it. Right?       And did not believe it.           Found as a matter of fact that the blood was -- was not a result of the spill.            That -- is that a conclusion of law?            I don't care what part it put it in.             The district court did not believe that the blood on the trousers was a consequence of the spill and that -- and that, therefore, blood was identified on the inside of his trousers that was the blood of the victim.        That's what the district court believed, having heard the testimony.         On that point -- on that one point, do you contend that the district court was clearly erroneous?         On that one point of the blood, of whether, indeed, his blood was on -- or the victim's blood was on the inside of his trousers?                  On that one point, do you claim that the district court was clearly erroneous?         What's your -- what's your second point?          Because I --         On the basis solely of the testimony of -- of this expert.          Including the contrary testimony that said if it had been the result of a spill, it would not have been splattered all over, as it was here.           Some of it wouldn't have been on the inside of the trousers.              Some of it wouldn't have been mixed with mud.           Despite all of that, you -- you can say that the district court's finding, which I consider a finding of fact, was clearly erroneous.          Excuse me.      I -- I agree that all of this stuff would -- would have made a better case for the defendant here.                   But once the case has been tried and both sides have put on all the evidence they have, we have a -- a much different test, and -- and that is whether any reasonable juror could have found him guilty.           That's a very heavy burden: whether any reasonable jury could have found guilt.                      I agree it would have been a much closer case, but -- but the burden you -- you have before us here is to establish that no reasonable jury could possibly have found him guilty.        And on -- just on the blood thing alone, I -- I find that a hard burden to bear.        And it also contained the testimony of an expert who said that if the tube spilled in that way, it would not have created the kind of spatterings that -- that were incriminating in this case.       Even if there was some spill, it would not have produced the kind of spattering.                So, you know, I call that a draw.            That -- that would be an important point if, in fact, it conclusively established that the blood was not the blood of the victim, but I don't think it does conclusively establish that, and if it doesn't, the -- the less than perfect performance of counsel is -- is no basis for setting aside the conviction.           Right.      And -- and the point of controversy is whether a spill of -- of the -- of the blood in -- in the course of transport could have produced this -- this kind of -- of spattering, including a spattering on the inside of -- of the trousers near the button.                It -- it seems to me unlikely, and -- and I am unable to say that no reasonable jury -- juror could not think it unlikely.        It's much more than that.            Oh, but surely he's supposed to make factual determinations.                    We -- I -- I don't want to make factual determinations on all these questions.             That's -- that's not our system of law. Those factual determinations are made by the trial judge.       And here, I agree with you that we don't have to accept his judgment as to what a reasonable juror would have done, but I do think that we have to accept his factual findings as accurate unless they're clearly erroneous.             And here, he made the factual finding that that blood was there before the transport.                   And I -- I think I'm bound by that unless you can show that it is clearly erroneous, which I don't think you can.        But -- but the -- the injuries on the body are simply not consonant with -- with that manner of her -- of her death.               A police officer testified not only to a head injury, but to blood coming out of the nose and ears, scratches and bruises on her throat and legs, scratches on her face. That simply is not consonant with one whack on the head.          Well, Schlup shouldn't -- shouldn't have expressed it that way then.              Schlup must have -- must have made a big mistake when it said no reasonable juror could.              It should have expressed it differently and said a reasonable juror would not -- would not have found, but they didn't say that.                  It said no reasonable juror.           Or more precisely, what would all reasonable jurors have done.           All reasonable jurors.
04-905 +++$+++        Well, and if there was a sale to the other dealer.         You would say that there had to be a sale to the other dealer.       Not just an --       -- not just an offer to the other dealer --       -- of higher prices.        Mr. Englert, I thought you were relying on the succeeding phrase, where "either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination are in commerce," which seems to require that -- "to discriminate in price between different purchasers where either or any of the purchases involved in such discrimination" -- I thought that's what you were hanging your hat on, to say that there has to be a discrimination in particular sales.
04-928 +++$+++         Ms. Williams, I don't -- I don't understand all of this discussion about what the -- whether the State law would have produced the same result, or not.          We have never held, have we, that, where a State Supreme Court opinion clearly rests on a Federal ground, a Federal constitutional ground, we do not have jurisdiction if there is a possible State ground that would have left it -- led to the same result?        Have we ever held that?        And we've said just the opposite, haven't we?       I suppose that if that provision weren't there, the court would have to decide, item-of-evidence by item-of-evidence, which pieces, that the jury has already heard, were relevant to the penalty, and not to the guilt.                  Whereas, by just allowing everything in, but just telling the jury, "You only consider it insofar as it goes to the penalty, and not to the guilt," we -- the court does not have to enter into that item-by-item discrimination.       That isn't the basis on which the court decided this case, is it?       What we're saying here is that this is a possible basis on which the Oregon Supreme Court might have decided this case.                 They did not decide it on that case -- on that ground.                 They decided that the jury has to be able to consider doubt, not because of that provision of the statute, but because of the eighth amendment.                And --       And --       What has our constitutional law regarding the requirement of allowing the jury to consider all mitigating factors -- the requirement that they have to be allowed to be take into account of that -- what guidance has that provided?                    Has our constitutional law said what constitutes a mitigating factor?       Apart from that, apart from the fact of whether the person's guilty or not, have we specified what factors the jury can take into account by way of mitigation?        Don't you think that if a State listed specific factors that could be taken into account, and no others, that there would be considerable doubt whether this Court would allow such a statute to stand?       When you --       So, you think -- you think the Oregon Supreme Court might well come out that way, if it wished, although not resting on the eighth amendment?       Yes.         General Williams, I have one question.         I'm not sure it goes to our eighth amendment question before us, but I honestly don't understand what your statute is all about.                 It says that after having been convicted of aggravated murder -- aggravated murder -- the sentencing jury shall be presented with the following questions.                      Number one, whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that death of the deceased, or another, would result.                      Don't you have to find that in order to convict of aggravated murder?         Plus, okay.         -- I gotcha.
04-944 +++$+++         What's the practical consequence of the one or the other?                  Number one, if you don't raise it below, you can still raise it on appeal if it's jurisdictional.               Right?        And number two, the -- if it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by the -- by the judge rather than by the jury?            But that's always the case. I mean, why -- you know, if those disadvantages -- those disadvantages will always exist.                    So why would Congress ever make something jurisdictional rather than simply making it an element of the cause of action? You understand what I'm saying?                    I mean, that's always a consequence.            And yet, you -- you acknowledge that some things are jurisdictional.        Well, wait.        You -- you pleaded -- you pleaded that -- that the defendant was -- was an employer under the act.                 Right?        And it's the definition of employer that says he has to have more than -- more than 15 employees.         So, in effect, you -- in making your complaint, you -- you at least implied and maybe said that this person is an employer under the act.                   So it seems to me at that point the -- the burden shifts to the other side to say -- the burden of going forward of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted what -- what your complaint on its face says.        I knew you would. (Laughter.)           Does it -- does it have to be resolved preliminarily?                Why can't you leave the jurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion of the trial with all the other questions?                    Is there some rule of law that says that a jurisdictional question must be confronted before the trial and before the merits? Indeed, most jurisdictional questions are reexamined as the trial proceeds.                    That is, you know, initially the court will say, yes, there appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the pleading.                    Then if there's a motion to dismiss, yes, there -- there appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the affidavits.            But then if the trial proceeds and it turns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the court dismisses.           So why couldn't this jurisdictional question always be handled that way?                     Just -- just leave it to be resolved during the trial.                    It wouldn't slow anything up.        Okay.     So this is a third consequence of the jurisdictional issue.        If the issue is jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't belong there and they've got to be chucked out; whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant claims are properly before the court.        That's an important consequence.         Do you think -- do you think it's possible that -- that Indian tribes could be jurisdictional but an employer couldn't?                 I mean, it seems to me the two the questions are quite different. An Indian tribe is always an Indian tribe.                Right? And you're -- you're excluding -- just as a prosecutor is always a prosecutor.             You're excluding a whole category of people.           But you're -- you're not excluding a category of employers here, are you?                Because it's a -- it's a factual question, whether at the time of the alleged offense, the particular company was employing more than 15 people.           It isn't that this company forever has immunity.        So you're -- you're not arguing for the Indian tribes here.
04-9728 +++$+++           Why are they dire?       I mean, he's just back in the situation he would have been in, did he not comply with the conditions of his parole.                      I don't see that that's dire.                   He has a choice.   He can stay in prison and --          -- and suffer the reduction of privacy there, which is much, much greater than being subjected to -- I mean, he -- he cannot even go to the toilet in privacy.               Or he can go out on parole, subject to the condition that --          -- that he --          -- he can --          -- be searched.          No, but it's --          -- but it's also clear from the California statute that it is not a right, that it's a privilege, that you get the privilege of parole in exchange -- in exchange for agreeing to the conditions, one of which is that you can be searched.          California statute says it's a privilege, doesn't it?          It does.          Even if the --          -- prisoner -- oh, I thought that he can turn it down, and that some prisoners do, if     --          -- if they decide that they don't want to be subjected to searches.          Is -- and you mean people are put out on the street when -- kicking and screaming when they say, "No, I want to stay in jail.                   I don't want to be" --          -- "searched.      I would rather stay in jail"?             And --          -- they are dragged out --          -- into the street.       Is that what happens?          Oh, I --          -- I don't think so.          When he's in prison, is there any problem about the prison guards intruding upon his privacy, willy-nilly, whenever they choose?          I mean, walking --          -- by his cell, which is always opened, and checking in on him to see what's -- what he's doing.          So, he's better off on parole than -- well, at least no worse off on parole than he would be when he was in prison.          Are --          Not --            -- by me.         No, please.          But there is a breathtakingly high probability that he is committing a crime.       The statistics cited in the Government's brief say that in an April 2001 report prepared by the California Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 68 percent of adult parolees are returned to prison -- 68 percent; 55 percent, for a parole violation; and 13 percent for the commission of a new felony offense.                  I mean, it seems to me a breathtaking statistic like that may call for breathtaking --          -- measures to try to police the matter closely.          You say there was a case in which, without any special reason, they did --          -- a cavity search --          The California Supreme Court may -- might well hold that it's arbitrary to conduct such an extreme search as a body-cavity search, or to - - I don't know --          -- to decide to search the person when he's in the men's room or something.                I mean, there are --          -- there are a lot of limitations that the California court --          -- could put on it, within the context of harassment or --          Mr. Long, is it -- is it fair to compare California to other States?                  The assumption would have to be that other States grant parole as liberally as California does.                   Maybe California has made the decision, "We have too many people in prison.        We're going to let a lot of them out, but we're going to keep them on a very tight leash."        Why shouldn't it be able to do that?             To have tighter controls, but let out many more people on parole, which is -- which is exactly what I think they're doing.          But my only --          -- point is --          -- the fact that other States aren't as tight doesn't prove anything, because other States --          -- may not be --          -- be trying to do the same thing --          -- to empty their prisons --               But we --               -- we normally don't look into the mind of the officer to decide whether his action was okay or not.
04-980 +++$+++        It is, indeed, very complicated, Ms. Kirkland.            And, I forget, which provision of the Constitution is it that contains this complexity? [Laughter.]       That says?          Is that what the eighth amendment says?          Cruel and unusual punishments are forbidden.            And this is where that comes from?       What did -- what did the California Supreme Court hold?           Did it hold that considering the "heinous, atrocious, or cruel" nature of the crime as part of the totality of the balancing was improper, or did it hold that that language is insufficient to form one of the narrowing functions that the aggravating circumstances provided.       So, if I think something is "heinous, atrocious, or cruel," I can use that in the balancing, even though I can't use it as one of the narrowing factors.
05-1056 +++$+++                Mr. Olson, before you get into the merits I have a question, a preliminary question.     I understand from AT&T's brief that there has been a stipulation entered into between the parties after the judgment below which preserved Microsoft's right to appeal and prescribed different dollar amounts that Microsoft must pay AT&T depending on the outcome of the appeal.     Does that raise any, any muteness problem? Can you sort of wager on the outcome of an appeal that way?               Well, suppose two parties just, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a case or controversy, bet each other that the district court will come out one way or the other way in, in a trumped-up suit.     Does that create a standing --               Well, you could say the same thing in the hypothetical I gave.                    It is a matter of wager, which way the Court will come out.               Do you know of any, any precedent for that?               That's so, but is there a lot of money involved depending on whether you win or lose?               Okay.                 Or at least the correct way to understand component.              You can't patent, you know, on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?              There needs to be a device.               Can I ask you, the point I don't understand when you say the -- the component is the disk that contains material, I understand that because here is a separate piece; it's a disk.                      You plug it in; it has the information on it.                      But then you say, if you put it on the hard drive it becomes the component.     But the hard drive is not a separate thing like a disk.     And when you say you put it on the hard drive you have nothing there but -- but -- but ons and offs.   You have nothing there but the -- but the thought.               How can you call, you know, what?   Is it a separate section of the hard drive?                     No.              I'm sorry.
05-1074 +++$+++               I don't really see a vast difference between a promotion and being elevated to a higher pay grade.      I mean, there may be no different responsibilities but it's a single act of discrimination:   "No, you're not going to move up to the next pay level."       I don't see why that's different from "no, you're not going to move up to the next job."            How does, how does time solve that difficulty?            But that, but that would not be the result if the reason for the disparity between 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial of a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather denial of a promotion to another job.           If that were the case, then it washes out and you have to challenge it right away.           Does that make any sense?           Well, you could call it a secondary effect but the only reason you want to get promoted to another job is to get more money.             I think it's a primary effect.           So you too then have to go, unless you can find a present policy to discriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go back whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20 years?           Do you agree that their action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of Bazemore?
05-1120 +++$+++                 I thought that the standing requires imminent harm.         If you haven't been harmed already, you have to show the harm is imminent.                 Is this harm imminent?              When?      I mean, when is the predicted cataclysm?              Well, there's a lot of conjecture about whether -- I gather that there's something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus on how much of that is attributable to human activity. And I gather that -- what is it?                Something like seven percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to automobiles in the United States?              6 percent?      Thank you.                Yes, but that doesn't go to the harm that you're claiming.               I mean, we're talking about the, you know, the standing issue right now.                     And if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of carbon dioxide emissions, right?                I understand, but that has nothing to do with whether you have standing.                  That has to do with the merits of the case.                  But on the standing point, only new cars would be affected, right?                  So even the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years, wouldn't it?                I understand.      But it goes to how imminent the harm is and how remediable the imminent harm is.    If, in fact, the 6 percent will only be reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few years, your --               Not in the first year.               I mean ultimately, when all the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent would be the figure.              I mean, do we know that that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of your coastline?    Is that how it works?                 I'm not a scientist, but I'd be surprised if it was so rigid.              What of a small landowner?             No, I'm not sure -- I think our opinions have even said it, but certainly commentators have often said it, that really the far margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the added pollution from municipal incineration of municipal waste which would -- which couldn't be transported by rail for burial because the ICC rates were too high, that added pollution interfered with the students' -- they were Georgetown Law students -- their hiking in the George Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge. That seems to me a much more immediate kind of damage; yet that's been referred to as really the far margin of our standing cases.             You're talking not about their being affected by ambient air but being affected by a stratospheric effect which then has another consequence that you allege.              I don't understand that.   You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts State action?    You can complain about the implementation of that law because it has preempted your State action? Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?               Do you know any case that has ever held that?             Mr. Milkey, I had -- my problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds.                 To be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an air pollutant.   If we fill this room with carbon dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers health.   But I always thought an air pollutant was something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and your claim here is not that the pollution of what we normally call "air" is endangering health.              That isn't, that isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is contributing to global warming.              That's why I don't want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.              Yes, and I agree with that. It is when it comes out an air pollutant.                   But is it an air pollutant that endangers health?                   I think it has to endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air at all.              Well, it talks about air pollution all the time.       That's what the, that's what the thing is about, air pollution.                It's not about global warming and it's not about the troposphere.             Mr. Milkey, do you want us to send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if only the last two pages of their opinion were given as a reason that would suffice?           Would that make you happy?             I didn't think so. (Laughter.)             That's what I was asking, yes.   And you think it will go back to them and they will say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is not enough by itself?      You really expect that to happen?             They said it already.             The only question is whether that alone is enough.
05-1126 +++$+++            They just have to say orally, I wish you would reconsider that?                     Because if that's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see anything to be gained by -- by such a holding.                        It doesn't tell you -- you know, this is a suit against a number of large corporations, nationwide businesses, thousands of employees.                     And on this complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom, where, when, any of that. I can understand that you're saying that does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense. But if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all right so long as they said orally.                 I mean -- forget about it.             Did you seek a more specific statement?             Why not?            Why didn't you ask when and where was this agreement.            What do you mean can be held, can be thought to hold that?                Is there any interpretation of what they did.            And some parallel action would indicate that wouldn't it?               I mean, if for example they, you have nine companies that change their price at the same hour of the same day, 10 months in a row.            So you're, you're not saying that parallel action can never create this, this kind of --             But what if it didn't?         I mean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens puts.   Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing else except that these defendants entered into an agreement in -- in restraint of trade.             Mr. Barnett, I thought --            Mr. Barnett I thought you had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the particular day of the agreement.                That it would be enough if it was the kind of parallel action that suggested an agreement that over nine years they all raised the price at the same time.                  Now that doesn't really give the defendant notice of, you know, what individuals were responsible for this, when it occurred.   But you say that would still be adequate?
05-11284 +++$+++               Tennard, Tennard was decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?              And where is -- this is an AEDPA case, isn't it?              So we're, we're asking whether this State court made an unreasonable decision at the time, and at the time regardless of what the Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson, and -- and there is another earlier case, we said that you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long as there was some manner in which mitigating effect could be given that was enough.              So I think Tennard is utterly irrelevant even if it is right.                Did Tennard purport to overrule Smith, even when it came down?                       It simply, it simply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's concurrence in an earlier case.                It certainly didn't purport to overrule Smith?                I'm sorry, Johnson, not Smith.                It's absolutely one step removed from that.                I say the actual question is even one step removed.            It's whether it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you conclude, which is wrong.                But unreasonable.
05-11304 +++$+++             Did they find it could or did they find that it did?         I thought our holding was that given the instructions, the jury would not necessarily take into account those mitigating factors, and I thought that what the Texas court held is, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see whether that possibility came to pass, which is what harmless error analysis involves.               So they are not contradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required to take it into account, but they are saying nonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into account, and therefore, the error was harmless.                 That doesn't contradict our opinion.                I mean, you might want to argue against it on the merits, but I don't think that will contradict our opinion.               That's right.       And that means that the jury was not instructed to take it into account.     And I think the Texas court is conceding that.     But it's, it's saying, nonetheless, we don't think that the error made any difference because, in our view, the jury did take it into account.           Yes, but it seems to me it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying the instruction was okay.         And it's something else to use it for the purpose of saying even though the instruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy instruction and a juror could very reasonably have understood it not to allow nullification, nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the jury indeed thought it had the nullification power. I don't see how it contradicts our opinion.              They didn't say it was an adequate vehicle.    I mean, they acknowledged that that instruction shouldn't be given again because it doesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the jury must do, and I think they accept that.              They say, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't require -- we think the jury did indeed think it had the power to nullify.               And, and this was unpreserved error.      I mean, they are not saying this for everything.   They are saying he did not object to the instructions at the time and therefore our harmless error standard is -- is more rigorous than it would otherwise be.         What's unreasonable about that?            Yes, but that's a very generalized argument, and what he won on was a very specific point that, that this instruction in effect required, if they were going to give mitigating effect, required a jury nullification.                 That's a very specific point.            He did not object -- he did not object to that specific problem.                 Had he objected, the court would have said, you know, there is something to what you say, and I'll give a different instruction.      But he didn't.            Do we make up our own procedural rules, too?         I mean, why, why -- why is it just a Federal judgment as to whether it adequately complied with the Texas rule?               Presumably we should make up our own rule.            Why not?            You say it's a Federal question.             That's -- that's a little bit different from your, from your response to Justice Souter.     You are making a much narrower argument.     You, you don't --             You don't assert that in every case when there is a procedural objection in a capital case or any case involving Federal law, Federal law will determine whether the procedural objection is adequate?               Well, I just don't -- you say whenever, whenever a court decides the case on the merits instead of using an intervening procedural objection, the procedural objection is waived.            Especially in capital cases, courts don't like to say, oh, you know, yes, you may be innocent but there's this procedural objection.    I think most courts --            Well, it's my experience with a lot of courts.            Who gives the State court the power to, as you say, waive that objection?              I can understand when you say the prosecutor didn't object.    It's the prosecutor that has the power to forfeit certain arguments on behalf of the people which he chooses not to raise.            Well --
05-1157 +++$+++                Did it, did it specifically state that, or is it that or just the principle that all Federal agencies have an obligation to --                I don't even think we mentioned them.    Did we mention them?                Did we mention them in those cases?                Well, maybe we just forgot. (Laughter.)               I suppose if primary jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace the antitrust laws.             The EPA is not a hands-on regulatory agency the way the SEC is.                      It has not been given an entire industry to regulate.              Well, the Government says that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and where they -- where they render the action here lawful. There's no -- no problemo.            What's wrong with that?              The Government's willing, in other words, to give the SEC carte blanche.                      Whatever you say is lawful is lawful that won't violate the antitrust laws.              Extends a lot further, I would think.              So we could decide that way.   We could say, we don't have to decide what the standard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as the Government does, you would win, you would be happy --              But the problem you address has been a problem of strike suits.                     And it is the problem that Congress addressed in its legislation. Shake downs.   It just is less expensive to pay off the suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion, where that conclusion is highly uncertain. And I don't see how your -- your solution of inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any more than the current situation does.              I wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end.                What's your test, Mr. Shapiro?
05-1240 +++$+++                  But only if, only if the challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if sustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial language -- invalidate the criminal conviction.                  Would necessarily have? You could have said that ex ante?                  You don't know what other evidence there might have been in the criminal case.                         Ex ante you can't tell.                Again, you didn't, you didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he was bound over.     You really didn't know that until the trial.   For all you knew, they might have found in addition to the confession, they might have found eyewitnesss who would have identified your client.                You couldn't tell that until the trial.                Until the trial, until the process of trial began.               But the conviction in Heck existed at the time of the alleged tort.                     And what Heck said is where you have an outstanding conviction, and you have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that constitutional -- and where -- you cannot sue on that constitutional tort if the decision on the tort would effectively contradict your conviction.                     Until the conviction has been set aside. Well, this is not that situation.                       There was no outstanding conviction involved.                     So why did you have to wait?               Would he have to sue on the first one right away?               Mr. Flaxman, before you save your time, I didn't understand why you're content with Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind that the way he put it is, so long as the -- as the criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute of limitations, how does that help you when the statute of limitations has passed?           Then there's no tolling.               And two years doesn't seem to be unheard of.             You're willing to let those people go?             Those are the only defendants you are concerned about?
05-1256 +++$+++             Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say.            And we can say that is error and remand it to them.            That might not make you very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not --           No.    If it had said that, I would have no trouble with it.           What it says is, you may consider it in determining what the reasonable relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed.           I don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to Jesse Williams' harm.           That's my problem with it.              I don't.             The jury can't really find that other people were harmed.            The jury doesn't have evidence before it except as to this person.             The most the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming other people.    I think a jury could find that.           And therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be punished more severely.        But I -- you don't --             Yes, but I don't think I'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty.             And I don't think this jury has any basis for finding that other people were harmed.    It could say there was a serious risk of it.
05-1272 +++$+++                Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you a question.     Am I wrong about this?                    It seems to me that if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he get any money, but neither should the government.                       Isn't that the way the statute reads?               How is there any other possible one?     It says there's no jurisdiction in this situation.              It's not brought by the United States as long as he's still there.              That's your argument.               I guess it really depends on whether you think the language "if the Government proceeds with an action" is equivalent to the Government's bringing the action.               Well, wait.     It says under 3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action.                Now, that suggests that if the Government intervenes the Government is proceeding with the action, right?               But you say that's different from the Government bringing the action.               You're being very picky-picky with this text, considering that you're willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as the -- so long as the original party, so long as the non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it become as action brought by the United States.             That's a very, very expansive notion of what "brought by the United States" means. What I'm saying is or, to put it another way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being brought by the United States, to be logical about it you must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private plaintiff under -- under he's not original source, the whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the Government's recovery.               I know, but it would be so extreme that we're not likely to buy it.              They don't have to give them any money, though.        The court doesn't have to.              But you'd then have to pay his attorneys' fees.      That's what really this is about, isn't it?              Factual theory of falsity, that doesn't mean anything to me.             Am, am I correct that they were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks were being produced?             Is that true, is that conceded?                You may find another one.               What is your response to the Government's assertion, which seems to me quite true, that in order to -- in order to prevail it did not have to show why these blocks were not solidified?               It just had to show that they weren't.   So it doesn't matter whether they were using his theory or too little cement.                  It doesn't matter.
05-128 +++$+++        Where -- where is the unomitted language?         What -- what page of the brief are you quoting from?       Now, ERISA -- ERISA makes it very clear that -- that a plan to pay insurance for employee benefits, whether it's disability or retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit plan and -- and explicitly excludes workmen's comp because otherwise it would fall within that definition of an employee benefit plan.       I know that's a different statute.         I'm not saying that the -- that the definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that it is a permissible use of the -- of -- of the term employee benefit plan.          All right.         Tell me why.       Before you -- before you go on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine?                 Maybe Mr. Verrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you must have your -- your version of it.                  How do you decide whether an insurance premium is for work that was done within the last 180 days?                 How -- how do you calculate it, whether that characteristic of the -- of the statute is complied with?       Oh, if it said premiums due within the last 180 days, I could understand it --            Or else establish that there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any sense.         We're together on this. (Laughter.)       The -- the correlative hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer describes in which the employer has contracted to pay his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.       You say that would be this case.       And you say that wouldn't be covered.            Where does (a)(3) appear? There -- there was that discussion in your brief, and I'm darned if I could find (a)(3).        Well, it would have been nice to have it in your brief --        -- and numbered -- numbered 3 instead of 4.          That would have helped a lot.
05-1284 +++$+++                Do they cite any particular document or statement --               -- that constitutes the delegation?               Do all these contracting cases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody, executing law?   On behalf of the Government?               Because that's your test. I mean, and if that is the proper test, it ought to apply in the Government contractor situation, too. So, for example, the Government can hire a private company run prisons; but that would be the Government hiring somebody to perform Government -- Government functions.      Now, do all of those -- a function that remain as Government function, keeping the incarcerated incarcerated.          Now do, do all of the contract cases involve that?                 Well --                 But that puts a whole new theory on your --                 Oh.                 And he was acting under color of law as you've described that in your petitions? I don't think so.                 Well, I, I it seems to me color of office, you say color of office, it means that its appearance to somebody else is that -- that he is being an official.      And I would think that that requires the fact that he's assisting a Government agent in enforcing the law against somebody.             Just out of curiosity, what, what happens to the, the employees of the private companies that run prisons?             Could they removed under this provision?             They either run the prison for a State, or for the Federal Government.             -- or the Federal Government.              Is that the test here?     Is that the test here?     If it is State action, it is covered by this statute.        If it isn't, it is not?              But suppose it doesn't.              Should I conclude it therefore is not covered?              Do they test their products before they're marketed under rigid Federal testing regulations which are supervised by the Federal Government?              Is the Government supervising those?               Yeah, but is there some Government official who's there to make sure that the testing is being done the way, the way it's supposed to be, which is what, what is argued is the case here?               They don't have to be there every day.               Policing --               I have a contract to provides food to the Senate cafeteria, okay.                 And the Senate or maybe the Executive Branch, for that matter, closely supervises my preparation and service of that food.   Am I acting under, even though I'm not assisting the Government in any governmental function at all? Don't you have to be assisting in the performance of a governmental function?                  Well, how many others involve the agency calling the result of the private action the FTC figures and the FTC test?              But they don't -- they don't put it out to the public as the Federal Government's figures.              That makes a big difference.              Just don't call it the Government's test.      Don't call it the Government's figures.   Call it the industry's figures.
05-130 +++$+++             Is -- is that so with -- with respect to someone else's use of -- of your property?         It seems to me very rare where -- where someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't -- wouldn't give you the property back and -- and simply say, you know -- I can think of a few extraordinary examples.         If somebody makes a statue out of stolen gold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd get the money back.              But ordinarily we're talking about a property right here, and -- and the property right is -- is explicitly the right to exclude others from -- from use of that.             That's what the patent right is. And all he's asking for is give me my property back.            You know, I mean, that's -- that's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the patent law.              I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy that problem.            But I don't think we should write -- write our patent law because we have some renegade jurisdictions. Why -- why isn't the -- the free market normally adequate to solve any problems you're talking about?       Everybody is in this for the money.             Nobody is going to hold off giving the license beyond the point where -- where it makes financial sense.       Why can't -- why can't we let the market take care of the problem?       I think maybe you exaggerate the -- the extent of equitable discretion.               I mean, it wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems like a good idea or not a good idea.                        There are a lot of rules for when -- when you would give injunctive relief and not.             And -- and I -- you know, I'm not sure you're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging allowance that -- that you seem to be arguing for.            Why -- why does the fact that -- that you're not practicing the invention make a difference?              I mean, why -- why should I be in better shape, as far as getting an injunction is concerned, if I produce an automobile engine and -- and make some undeterminate profit --            -- from the use of this particular invention in the engine than I would be if I licensed it with a royalty based upon the number of sales of engines?             I mean, they're both risking, you know, the same future use of the -- of the device.                   Why -- why does one situation justify an injunction more than the other?          By not occupying it, you mean including not licensing it to somebody else.
05-1342 +++$+++                Well, I assume that the Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio of loans to real estate value, things of that sort.                  And I assume that the States may have different rules with regard to that; right?        In other words, the oversight might be different.      The States may be more permissive as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal Government is.    And if you have a State subsidiary that is overseen by state authorities, you might have a different result.                 Well, if not I don't see any advantage in this great Federal banking system you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.                I thought your point was that the statute defines national bank, but also defines affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.                And I thought your point was that the effect of this regulation is to simply eliminate that distinction?               I didn't understand that you made this --             Mr. Blanchard, if I could go back to what you were saying before this last line of questioning, I didn't understand your position to be that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it apparently without limitation.             And where its regulation conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal prevails.              Ah, or the more restrictive.              The Federal Government says you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 8 billion.              Wait.       What happens in that situation?              Well, invent some other hypothetical then.      I'm talking about a situation in which the Federal law is more permissive than the state law.     Which law prevails?         The Federal law allows this bank to do things which the state law would not allow it to do.     As I understood your prior answer, you say oh, of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law prevails.     I didn't understand that to be your position. And if it is your position, I don't know what all this fuss is about.     That's the end of the game, isn't it?               Exempt from state examination?                That's not the question. Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do an adequate job, the state agency comes in?                Maybe civil rights actions where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the citizen is free to bring litigation in state court?                     I guess that would be --               Did this go through your -- can I just ask --               Especially after this lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state banks?                 I know in Michigan.        I'm saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to kick the Feds out?      Or would that be prevented by this Federal statute we're discussing here?                    I'm trying to see what you think this Federal statute does.                    Or what the --
05-1345 +++$+++                  Well, I don't understand. You know, as far as the impact on out of State competitors are concerned, it's exactly the same.                      The State or the municipality runs its own waste disposal facility.   There is no charge for dumping the waste there.   The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes. Okay. Now, the people you're representing, out of state people who would provide dumping grounds for this waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever they would charge.      It would be more than what the municipality is charging. Now, why isn't that a restraint on interstate commerce, discrimination against interstate commerce?                 Oh, I'm sorry.        You have to dump your waste in the municipal garbage dump.               Okay, so that's fair.     Even if they support it entirely by taxes?               So that they're not competing in the marketplace in any way, they're not getting any money from the people who are dumping garbage.     They get money from the whole tax base.               Oh, it is indeed.               I didn't think you'd be willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates the Commerce Clause.             You would say that they can do it so long as they charge less than out of State people --             -- and therefore people buy their services because they're cheaper.                So long as they don't prohibit the importation, if they run the municipal facility on tax revenues, and therefore charge very little for the electricity or whatever they're providing, that's perfectly okay for you.               Right?             So long as they don't prohibit anybody from out of State.               A tariff is also imposed by a State, isn't it?      As opposed to --               Money goes to a State.
05-1429 +++$+++ 
05-1448 +++$+++              Mr. Baker, I thought your position in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not make this reply to this exchange, is that the merger with another plan is not a termination, isn't that your basic position?             Because if it were a termination, in a termination, you must distribute the assets to the participants.             And here when you merge with somebody else, the assets are not distributed to the participants, but they are thrown into a pot with other people.              He doesn't like to hear that he is wrong.                 Maybe it's a simpler argument than this first one we've been wrestling with.                 I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a reversion to the employees who have made contributions.       They get their cash back?             Right.
05-1508 +++$+++                  Before you get into the substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill. Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94 legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the prior regulations?                 The prior regulations were promulgated when?              My goodness, that's a long time before.              With a different Secretary now.              So there's no reason to believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is there?              Indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?               Was this the same Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?              Why, why would the Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula should be?   Which is the power he had before.                I mean, one must think that there must have been some pressures from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take some power away from me, please.                 Counsel, I thought you said that you did know what it was.                I thought you simply quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.                    That's what's being distributed.                Such revenues or expenditures in the State consist of, the word "such" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the State, and that prior reference in subsection A is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil.              I thought the problem was disparity in school districts.                Since much of the funding for education is local funding, in some places there are very rich school districts and very, very poor, poor school districts.              And I thought that the purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to district.     It makes perfect sense, it seems to me.
05-1541 +++$+++                In the law, we don't -- we certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision of its whole purpose and effect.                 And as I understand the purpose of this especially short statute of limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose of the property that it has seized, and to be able to give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you know, many years later and saying this property should not have been taken.        How is that purpose served if indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a longer statute?              What if the amount wasn't paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized by the Government.      Would the 1346 action still lie?           Or is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to satisfy the tax?              And that's the, it seems to me the principal problem that the Government was facing and justified the short statute, wasn't it?               That is the need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this property that it has seized.              But once -- once the money is put up, and what the Government has taken is in effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in proceeding under 1346.               I'm helping you.
05-1575 +++$+++                How would he make such a claim in this case where in open court he was asked by the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether it was the case that he did not want any mitigating evidence introduced?      And he said, right, yes, that's correct?               I wouldn't agree with it. I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear that it did not agree with the district court's determination that he had waived mitigating evidence.               I thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating evidence.             Isn't that so?    I mean, that's what that -- one of the reasons the case was here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a district court factual finding that he had waived any mitigating evidence.      Isn't that what happened?             So it wasn't remanding for a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence. It made the determination that he had not waived it, and then remanded for investigation into what that mitigating evidence would be.             Well, it's clear at least that they disagreed with the finding of the district court that there had been a waiver, no?             And it has not waived.     Not that the district court was -- didn't have enough evidence before it.     It says the foregoing, Landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective assistance. So how can you possibly say that that question is still open?             The district court has to accept that he hasn't waived.              And what it's sent back for is for all of the facts that show -- that show he had ineffective assistance of counsel.             The criminal gene argument.             I thought all that evidence was basically before the district court anyway.                    Didn't the district court know about all of that when it made its ruling?                 It's new to me also.           I never heard of it.                 Some kind of waivers, like waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what consequences of foregoing counsel are.                     So the judge discusses with him and, you know, points out what a -- what a significant decision that is.                     But it doesn't take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the question, you know, "do you agree that your counsel should not introduce any mitigating evidence?"                     I mean, it's clear on, on its face.             Well, unless the argument is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to argue, that -- that when you make waiver of all mitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's reached that far in the criminal process what mitigating evidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements of mitigation that could have been introduced.                 Which will almost never be the case.                So that it's always possible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating evidence to come into the court a year later and say, "Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence I didn't know about at the time.                 My grandfather was a criminal.     I didn't realize that at the time.              And now I want" -- you know -- "therefore my waiver was uninformed" and, you know, we go back to square one and try the case again. That would always be possible, wouldn't it?
05-1589 +++$+++                I'm surprised that that's the -- I would have thought its primary purpose would be to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes that they don't support.           Was there no First Amendment interest.               Is it only an election law interest?               But you just said the State Supreme Court was wrong.         I mean, why do you believe it on this if you don't believe it on everything else? You're appealing from it, aren't you?             Let, let's assume that it makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute was at least in part to protect the First Amendment rights of the non-union members or whether, as the Washington Supreme Court seemed to say -- at least they said its principal purpose was to protect the voting process.   Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a manner which renders it constitutional the court is obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law. Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the intent of the people who enacted this statute were?              Wouldn't the Washington Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which would make it constitutional rather than unconstitutional?               Are the courts in Washington State elected, do we know that?              Are they elected?               They are elected, so it's easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be done and we disallow what the people have voted for. That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?              Or even nongermane political expenses.                 Well, are there any other such entities that are given the power by the State to collect money from people against their will?              That's my understanding, too.   I think you got to get out of it some other way. I mean, you've got to say it's content but it doesn't apply when it's the government contributing money or it doesn't apply when you're applying it to money that's being coerced by the government.                 Can you get to the point you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing is?
05-1629 +++$+++                   I don't understand it.       How can he be convicted of -- of the consequential crime if he is never charged with the consequential crime?                  You charge him with the -- with the theft and convict him of assault?                 Okay, well I thought you -- I thought you answered --                 The theory being that anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which naturally leads to another crime intended the other crime as well.               And what about the remaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth Circuit?               Do we remand for those or what?                Mr. Himelfarb, you point out these last two issues are not, and probably correctly, that they are not fairly included within the question presented.     Well, that would be disabling if indeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise those two additional issues.             But here it is the respondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if we want to.              The respondent can seek to uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.              So we can reach those other issues if we wish.              Why wouldn't the better course be also not to decide the principal question you want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us to take, which is that if there are minor differences between what you might call the general law of aiding and abetting, it doesn't matter.               Why wouldn't it be wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind of consequential liability is part of the general law of aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief? So that would be the narrower ground.              In that former question as to whether California theft is general theft, do you propose the same rule?       That even if California has some minor variations -- not just in aiding and abetting but in what constitutes theft -- minor variations from what the general national rule is, they should be disregarded?   And if not, why not?              So you would limit your rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor variations, just minor variations in the aiding and abetting definition?              Is it the sentence given or the sentence prescribed for the crime?              Given.
05-1631 +++$+++               I don't know that I agree with that.   I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an hour is responsible for endangering people, you're proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50 percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop him, you shouldn't do anything.              I don't agree with that.              I'd stop him.   I mean, he's the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment, isn't he?              I think you're giving away too much.                 Well, I suppose there is also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt somebody else.                 I mean, the more you increase the speed the more likely he's going to be hurt.   But also the more likely if you let him go somebody else is going to be hurt.                 Finish that.                 Excuse me.           He reasonably -- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking the driver's life?      Is that why it's like the Third Circuit case?                 Well, but the Third Circuit case you just described didn't talk about intent.                       It talked about reasonable belief.               Whether he is endangering anybody is a historical fact, no?                So what do you do about that finding?               It is.              I would hope he would wait until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming before he, before he did the ramming.              I assume he waited precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?
05-18 +++$+++        I thought the GAO study included not just the -- the hours worked and the -- the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part of the parent challenging the school board action, but it also included those hours and those costs expended by the school.       In which case it could not possibly have been directed to what items are compensable.       On its face, it covers at least half of the items that are not compensable.           Did Congress say that, Mr. Kuntz?       Was this language, by the way -- I'm not clear.          It always cited to the House -- the House conferees.          Was -- was this language in the -- in the Senate conference report?       So we don't really know --       Well, that's only half of the Congress, isn't it?           Even if --       -- even if everybody in the House agreed with that, which we don't really know. What about the President?             When he signed it, did -- did he indicate any interpretation?       So we have a committee of one house that said -- that said that, that thought it meant that or would have liked it to mean that.          They are voted on when the -- when the conferees make changes, which they sometimes do.            Then -- then, of course, they have to be voted on.         So it's frequent.           It's frequent that they're voted on, but this one apparently -- there were no changes made and it wasn't voted on.            Justice Breyer knows that. He -- he's worked there.         Counsel, even in -- in those benighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we ever would use the conference report when the statute was not ambiguous.           I thought it was always a rule that -- that --
05-184 +++$+++        Where was that change made from the prior version?       Yes, but, I mean, what -- it was made in what house?           Was it made by the conference committee?       It was made in the Senate.          So the House presumably never saw the prior --       -- language.       And the President, who signed this bill, never saw the prior language.       So, why should we attribute to both the House and to the President a knowledge of the prior version of the legislation?       In the Senate.       Please go over that again.         I'm not -- I'm not sure I understood -- I understood your response.       You say that it could be read to preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here.         Could I come back to Justice Alito's question as to what the normal procedure would be in criminal cases?          Suppose you're -- you have a challenge to the makeup of the tribunal in a criminal case.                     Is it -- is it the normal practice that you would get to raise that challenge?         Let's say one of the judges is disqualified for some other reason.                    Can you normally raise that challenge before the criminal case is filed?         So, there would be nothing different in this situation, if you couldn't raise it until it was final.           Oh, I know --           -- the merits of the issue.       I'm just talking about the timing of the issue.           Well, when you say Congress hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends upon your reading of the statute.                   If, indeed, you read it the way the Government reads it, they would assert that Congress did consider these military commissions and thought that it was okay to wait until they had completed their work before full review was provided.           I mean, it's sort of a -- you know, a -- you're running in a circle.           As I recall the Sixth Amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you. And you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not the charge of aiding and abetting.        You acknowledge the existence of things called commissions.              Or don't you?            I mean --            What is the use of them if they have to follow all of the procedures required by the UCMJ? I mean, I thought that the whole object was to have a different procedure.       Mr. Katyal, you've addressed the Detainee Treatment act in its -- in its capacity as, arguably, removing jurisdiction.               Might not the act also function as a retroactive approval of what the President has done?       It depends on what you mean by "regularly constituted."           In your brief, I gather you -- what you meant is that a court that was pre-existing.                      It doesn't necessarily mean that.              It just -- it could mean one that was set up for the occasion, but was set up for the occasion by proper procedures.                   Wouldn't that be a "regularly constituted court"?       Well, I mean, not ad hoc in that sense, "I'm creating one court for this defendant, another court for the other defendant," but setting up for the occasion, and for trying numerous defendants, a new court.       I don't think that, just because it's a new court, you can say that it's not a "regularly constituted court."
05-200 +++$+++           But that's different from putting it in.           I mean, you want to change what you -- what you allege, that -- that it's mandated by the Government to simply the Government, although it had authority to eliminate it, did not do so?                  If -- you know, that's a different -- different assertion.        I'll assume it's the latter then.            Those cases came from the days when we were also quite willing to imply Federal causes of action in statutes that had nothing to do with the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that sort.       I thought we had put all of that behind us.                 You want us to go back to that bygone age.          That's sort of queer terminology anyway. When Congress has already decided that there should be Federal jurisdiction.                  It would seem very strange for Congress to say this strengthens the case for Federal -- what do you mean the case for Federal jurisdiction?          We prescribe Federal jurisdiction.            I -- you know, I'm not a fan of legislative history, but I -- I don't find that particular piece very much against you.                   In fact, it may be just -- just the opposite.                   It may be -- it's lawyers' language, you know.                  We don't know whether there's Federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make a better case for -- you know, for the other side.       Yes, but -- but -- I'm sorry.       It's a sloppy way to put it, don't you think?         Maybe what Congress should have said, although Congress doesn't always speak precisely, is that any -- any State law which contradicts a provision of the contract on these particular subjects is preempted.            Okay, I'll put it differently. All State laws relating to subjects that are covered in the contract are preempted.          Suppose there's a dispute in the -- in the lawsuit about whether a particular benefit to which one - the party was entitled under the contract has been waived.              Okay?      That's the issue.     Is that issue to be decided by Federal law or by State law?         Yes.         No, I'm not talking about the -- I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier.                   And -- and it is asserted that this claim should have been made sooner. It has been waived by not having been brought forward sooner.        Okay?     That's -- that's the hypothetical.           Do -- do you think that that -- that is governed by Federal law?         Whether waiver occurred or not.       Why?       I mean, the text -- the text only -- only says, shall -- which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits.                Extent of coverage or benefits.            I don't know that that relates to any of them.           It relates to whether the benefit that was covered has been waived.       Yes.       It doesn't speak to it.       Okay.      So you're not saying that -- that Federal law is -- is pervasive here, that it covers the -- the entire -- the entire suit between the claimant and the insurer.       Okay.      In that respect, doesn't it differ from ERISA?       Well, you're gong to make a lot of trouble for us.           We're going to have to sort out which of these things are covered by State law and which aren't.       -- was that the common law, Federal common law precluded, preempted any State law which contradicted this contract.                Now, you can -- you can put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the contract preempted State law, but it wasn't --       -- that we thought it was the contract that preempted State law.                 It was Federal common law which said that the contract -- that any provision in State law which contradicts the contract is preempted by Federal common law. And you can read this statute the same way. It's a sloppy way of putting it, but what it means is Federal law preempts any State provision that is contrary to a provision of the contract --       -- which -- which is certainly constitutional.       Congress isn't always precise, is it?
05-204 +++$+++         You think that's no good.        Not -- not even to prevent retrogression, which would violate section 5.        But that was done for political reasons, not racial reasons.        But what -- what is your proposal?         What -- what is -- what is a State to do if -- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing its districts, perfectly valid political motivation let's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that it would eliminate a majority minority district, what -- what is the State supposed to do?         Surely, that's not what makes it bad.          Even if they created a compact district but with the -- with the intent of creating a majority minority district, that would be a district created for a racial reason.          The mere fact that this one happens to be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and -- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation unless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition against regression.        Wow.     That's a surprise. (Laughter.)        Which -- but it's a perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion that our political power enables us to -- to provide for.      Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for political reasons.           I mean, to say that this is, you know, something horrible is ridiculous.               You acknowledge that political motivation is fine.      Don't you?      I see.      Even -- even when the map is so distorted -- you -- you acknowledge that the map that came out, after this -- this realignment of districts, had less of a divergence between the voting strength of the Republican Party and the number of Republican seats than had existed under the previous allocation by the Democrats.        I'm saying less.     Less. It -- there's less of a divergence under the new map than there was under the old one.                 The only difference is this divergence is in favor of the majority.            Yes, but what percentage did they have?             I -- I thought that -- you say that they should have gotten 20 districts, and how many districts did the plan give them?            But you say that's what they should have had, given -- given the voting in the State.        Do you have any -- any authority either in the text of the Constitution or in a -- a case for the proposition that the only reason a legislature can reapportion its districts is because there's been a census?        Well, but that's your position when you said mid-decade redistricting is bad because your -- your position is the only reason is the census is -- has -- has caused there to be less than -- than one man/one vote.           That -- that little -- even if it's done by the court.                  I like the way you slipped that in.         I mean, even if you had a general rule that you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census, surely there ought to be an exception unless -- which -- which would read, unless the districting you're living under was never decreed by the legislature, but was decreed by a court.               And that was the situation here.       Surely, that's a good reason, even if you adopted your general proposition.          Well, I'd say that's a shame for the democratic process.                 I -- I don't like the idea that -- that there are a lot of districts out there that have never been drawn by the people, which is what the Constitution envisions.           I don't understand.     Does this go to motive or result?                 I mean, what if I'm -- I'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I remove it for that reason?                I'm not removing them for racial reasons.           I'm removing them because I want to remove Democrats.            And you're saying that if I have made a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic, that turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial decision?        I'm assuming --        -- they're removing them because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.        I thought you said that the county was 92 percent Latino or something like that.        Well, how can you -- how can you possibly take out any substantial number of Democrats without taking out Latinos?        Well, that's my point too. (Laughter.)        But, of course, you want them to use race to manipulate outcomes.                It's just sometimes.
05-259 +++$+++             But 703 has the language and 704 doesn't.             I mean, 703 has language limiting it to -- to employment, prerogatives of employment.                    704 doesn't.             No.     It wouldn't have to do -- I mean, fairly -- you know, to be fair, it wouldn't have had to say that.               It would have said any -- any act that is discrimination under 703.                       Any act that is discrimination under 703.                  Seven words it could have said.             That's a curiosity.      It is.        And the issue would be, I assume, how much a reasonable person likes a free lunch.        But -- but are you?    I'm -- I'm a little concerned that -- that you're trying to persuade us to interpret 704 the same as 703 at the expense of watering down 703.               I don't understand how you can concede that -- that refusing to invite somebody to lunch, if it's more than -- more than a single lunch, could be a violation of 703.               How does that come within the -- with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment?        Not -- not by the --        And -- and going to lunch is the conditions of employment.        Privilege.        Why wouldn't you say that Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical would be covered by the Meritor standard, if in fact this woman couldn't -- couldn't really do the job with this -- with this new time assignment?         Why wouldn't it qualify as being sufficiently severe or persuasive --        -- to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive work environment?            So she was docked in her pay for 2 weeks.             I mean, for some people, this would be a real hardship, no pay for 2 weeks.                         I mean, it's -- it's final as far as she's concerned, for those 2 weeks.            Yes, well, they went back later and -- and made up for their mistake.                        But -- but the -- it seems to me the issue is whether a mistake was made that -- that was final action that hurt her. I don't see why -- it's certainly official action.                           I mean, you can't say --            -- it's not official just -- just because it was decreed by a -- you know, a track boss or something.             It -- it was an action of the company because the company cut -- cut off her pay for 2 weeks.         Right?
05-260 +++$+++           Mr. Stris, I'd -- I'd like to know what -- what you make of our opinion in Barnes v. Alexander.            It's an old case but it involved a situation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee arrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all the money, without giving the lawyer his contingent fee.      We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded constituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is one of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to convey a specific object, even before it is acquired, will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets title to the thing.            Why doesn't that absolutely resolve the present case?        But we -- but, you know, our opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable relief, only restitutionary equitable relief.                    We've simply said whether equitable relief would normally be available.          And now you're -- you're trying to rewrite our cases to say that only certain types of equitable relief are -- are available.        And -- and if, indeed, it does -- it does occupy a lot of the field, so be it. That's the way Congress wrote the statute.       What -- I don't understand what difference that makes.               I mean, in both cases there was a commitment to pay the contingent fee.                  It was a promise. And when the money was collected, the court said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien upon your recovery in order to comply with the promise.        Take it.          Take it.   It's a good one.         Right.         Why -- why isn't that what occurred here?           What -- what's the essential difference?
05-352 +++$+++           When did -- when did we first hold that the State had to provide counsel if -- if the defendant could not afford his own counsel?       And that's what we generally mean nowadays by the right -- by -- by the right to counsel.         And when you talk about fairness being its objective, you're talking about the objective of that newly discovered right to have counsel appointed. But I don't know that fairness was the -- was the object of the original right to counsel in the -- in the Bill of Rights, which -- which only applied to -- to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you couldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one.               I hardly think that -- that fairness is the object of that.       When -- when was our first holding to that effect?       In the '30s.      Gee, that's --       -- that's hardly -- that's hardly the original purpose and meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and -- and you come here and say that its fundamental purpose is something that is only the purpose of the newly evolved Sixth Amendment and not of the original one.       I don't think that's the overarching goal of the original.                I think it's -- it's very fundamental, that if you have funds with which you can hire someone to speak for you, you should be able to use all of your -- I mean, your -- no.                 Your -- your freedom is at stake.         You should be able to use all of your money to get the best spokesman for you as possible. That's the element of fairness that I think is there.          But until the 1930s that element didn't exist.          Until the 1930s, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.          Well, excuse me.   As far as the Constitution is concerned, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.       So he was just disabled from -- from his first choice.       The court told him you can't have the counsel you want.             Go find somebody else.       Did Flanagan, the case that denied mandamus on this issue -- did it assume any resolution of the question whether if -- if you can't have counsel of your choice, in order to get your conviction reversed, you have to show -- you have to show that the error was not harmless?       No, I understand, but --       -- but I would certainly think that it's relevant to the question of whether you allow immediate appeal, what the consequences of not allowing immediate appeal are.               If you're totally deprived of your right, you -- you might allow it and --        I want a lawyer who will invent the Twinkie defense.                I would -- I would not -- I would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention of a competent lawyer.            But -- but I want a lawyer who's going to win for me.              And -- and there's no way to predict what lawyer has a charming way with the jury or -- or brings in some -- some side matters that maybe shouldn't be brought in but the judge is silly enough to let them in.          I want to win.        And -- and the criterion for winning is not how competent is the lawyer necessarily.       It's a fair trial.    Nobody is saying it wasn't a fair trial, but he didn't have the lawyer he wanted.           I mean, we could assure everybody a fair trial by allowing nobody to pick their lawyers and assigning lawyers to everybody.               That would -- that would accomplish fair trials throughout the United States, but that's not the system we have. You're -- you're entitled to the lawyer that you want.        I mean, you -- you could say the -- you could say the same thing, counsel, about his right to self-representation, that he has the right to self-representation for his defense or for his --        Yes, but it is limited to the right of self-representation for his defense, just as his choice of counsel is limited to his choice of counsel for his defense.       How do you think that would work with the Twinkie defense?       I don't think any court would conceivably reverse the -- the disqualification of counsel on the ground that he would have come up with that defense and win.
05-380 +++$+++           When it's halfway out, I guess you can call it either a child or a fetus.              It's sort of half and half isn't it?           Would it, would it be lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to keep it alive?
05-381 +++$+++                I assume it's a benefit to consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased because of higher prices being paid for those needed goods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit consumers who want those goods.              I presume it could lead to lower consumer prices too.         If you have a firm that has developed a new, a new technique for processing the logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and thereby make even more profit, that firm would be willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would sell them for less than competitors might sell them.             What do we do in the correlative situation where there is an allegation of predatory selling rather than predatory buying if you had the same situation posed by Justice Stevens?                    Namely evidence that you're trying to drive the competitor out of business, wouldn't that establish a violation?              I assume you could have a company that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to monopolize and the means that they choose is just idiotic.    For example, they say, we're going to try to get a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as, at as low a price as possible.               You would have the two elements, monopoly power, intent to monopolize, but you wouldn't have an act that constitutes anticompetitive conduct.              And that's what you're asserting is the case here.
05-409 +++$+++        Under your approach, Mr. Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal substantive issue in the case, the principal legal issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within -- within (c), sends it back to the State court.             Is -- is the State court bound by -- by that finding by the Federal court?       Why not?          Do we have any cases that -- that are like this one which are like this one which involve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of the finding by the Federal court, but the law of the case? I mean this is the same case when it's remanded. You've already had a court that has found a particular element with respect to this case.                      It seems to me highly unusual to have the same issue in the same case then decided by a second court.                    Do you have any -- any parallel?            You don't have any case of ours, though.       Whether preemption applies or whether there's a colorable basis for saying?               I thought you were saying that the district court decides whether preemption applies.       So you don't -- you don't agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all it's -- all it's making is a colorable basis.       So he's right that it's ultimately not decided by the Federal court.       You're saying the Federal court makes a decision which is not binding in the case.       That decision can be undone by the State court.       Yes, I understand that. Can you answer my question?           You -- you were saying that the -- that the decision by the Federal court on this issue is not final.       Okay, but it is not final --       -- for purposes of the lawsuit.       I understand that, but as long as you say that, the point that -- that Justice Alito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought that this was a -- a statute designed to have the Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out that the Federal court just takes the first swing at it, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's free to do so.
05-416 +++$+++           Conceivably, if it's too short, it's not reasonably available.                I guess --           Okay.           It's conceivable.
05-465 +++$+++        Before you get to your second point, why is that first point before us?                 You -- you didn't raise it in the courts below.              You didn't raise it in your petition here.               Your question presented it -- I'd like to stretch to reach it, but I don't even find it necessarily included within the question presented.         The question presented is whether a defendant corporation and its agents engaged in ordinary, arms-length dealings can constitute an enterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs. It seems to me it's only question two you put before us.       As it is in nine other circuits.       And all circuits against you.       And we would have been unlikely to accept cert on -- on point one alone I think.       In light of the settled rule that a defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.       If you hadn't included that last part, in light of, but it seems to me you're focusing on the -- on the particular claim that you're making.       It is logically prior, and I hate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this case if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway.                     I mean, you know, we're -- we're answering a totally hypothetical, nonexistent question.       If this provision is exclusive, as you claim it is -- it's intended to be an exclusive definition, why -- why would they include union, just union and individuals?                 What's magic about a union that --       -- that is not equally magic about a partnership or a corporation?       Oh, I see.       This refers to a union that is not -- is not an association.       Or any legal entity.       A union that is not --       -- not a legal entity.     I see.           Mr. Phillips, I -- I tend to agree with that, but I -- I just hate to get the lower courts into this business of determining when a corporation is going beyond its business.                  Your -- your discussion with Justice Souter I think indicates how -- how hard that is, or some of the examples that the Government brings up, such as a drug company that -- that sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws. Is that part of its business or not part of its business?         I -- I really don't -- don't want to buy into that.
05-493 +++$+++             It doesn't have to be forward- looking, does it?    I mean, I thought we've said "so long as it can be taken into account in any manner," whether backward-looking or forward-looking.                     Haven't we said that, explicitly?              Well, that's what I thought your position was.      And --              -- then you back off of it, and you say, "extenuate the gravity" of the crime doesn't relate to anything that's after the crime.                  I would have -- I would have interpreted the phrase to mean "anything that justifies you in giving a lesser punishment for the crime."              Well, then your answer to Justice Stevens should have been different.           Be respectful anyway.             I mean, having that opinion in front of them, you would think they would amend it, of course, to prevent that kind of decision again.               But you're saying those convictions are more than -- more than 23 years old?
05-502 +++$+++            What were they doing in the yard anyway?             This sort of occurred to me.        They couldn't have seen that until they went into the fenced backyard violating the curtilage of the property.                      How -- was that justified?           Is any less required to -- to go into the curtilage than is required to go into the house?           No.     It's the same test?           So you say that even if he didn't see him throw the punch and -- and draw blood, they could have gone in just because they heard somebody say, stop, stop, get off me?          Well, you don't -- you don't really mean that if they saw somebody inside with a gun and they heard him saying, I'm going to shoot you in 2 minutes, since they could have gotten a telephone warrant, they would have to had to get a telephone warrant?          I mean, you -- you don't want the -- the telephone warrant requirement to -- to up the ante on -- on what it takes to -- for the police to go in without a warrant, do you?          But it wouldn't be of the essence if you know you have 2 minutes. You know I'm going to kill you in 2 minutes.          Do you really want the policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and get a warrant?           That's ridiculous. (Laughter.)           Except that there was a front door, which they approached first.                   As I recall, they left one of the officers in the front.           So they could have banged on the front door.          Is there, in addition to the safety rationale which you're -- justification, which you're arguing here -- is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not?          Is -- is that a separate --          I mean, you see a guy turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and can you go in right away if you see him doing that?          Well, I mean, but if that's the case, you have a much easier argument.                  Wasn't there an assault here?              There was clearly an assault.        One thing leads to another. Right?            Well, no.         You -- you don't want to say that.             The noise alone wouldn't justify going in without knocking as would the -- a scene of a violent event occurring.                Certainly you'd have to knock on the door.             Now, if they didn't hear you and the only way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go in, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door real hard before you went in to stop the noise?           Not appropriate.        Necessary.           I hope so.        I mean -- people --       A good way to put it.           Except I -- I don't think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment.             I think we look to the facts that he had -- that had come to his attention which caused him to believe that this was a family reenactment.                   I mean, you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something else.       The facts are -- are what matter and not --
05-5224 +++$+++            Suppose I point the finger in an affidavit, and I just send the affidavit, you know.       I -- I don't want to get involved.            I'm in a foreign country.          I sign my name.         I even do it under oath, and I send it right to the judge that's trying the case, not to a law enforcement officer, to the judge.       You don't think the Confrontation Clause would cover that?        So your -- your thesis that it applies to just accusatory statements to a law enforcement officer has to be expanded a little.          What was she calling 911 for if she didn't want help?          I mean, she -- she wanted something from 911.             What did she -- what did she want? Did she want the police to come over and arrest her husband?         Was that -- or --           You say according to your reading of the cases, but you really don't have a case like this.          You -- you have a case where, after the fact, the -- the victim went to a constable or to some other official to report the event, and perhaps to seek help against the person who -- but you don't have anything where really, in the course -- in the course of the attack or -- or while the person is still at least under threat, a -- a constable is -- is called, do you?       You could have -- you could have somebody walking by -- a policeman walking by outside.       And the victim shouting, you know, please, somebody help me, Harry is beating me. You don't have a case like that.                So -- so I don't know why we should flop one side rather than the other on this -- on this case that -- that doesn't seem covered by -- by the old jurisprudence.               Why should we go your way on it and say that it -- it falls within the prohibition rather than say it falls outside the prohibition?       Yes, but that's not this case.       That --        Because of the -- because of the Confrontation Clause you think?       Well, I assume the defendant could summon that -- that witness if -- if that witness' location was known.               No?       And could find out from the prosecution where that witness was, I assume.       Maybe we should just -- just suspend the Confrontation Clause in spousal abuse cases instead of designing the entire application of the Confrontation Clause everywhere on the basis of what seems to be a special problem in spousal abuse cases.       I understand.       And I suppose we could also have said that the Sixth Amendment, like some other amendments, doesn't apply to State prosecutions --       -- or the Confrontation Clause portion of it, anyway --         -- which would exempt spousal abuse cases, by and large, until we -- until we enact a Federal spousal abuse statute, which -- which may well occur.       It seems to me there -- there are better ways to -- to solve this problem than to design the whole Confrontation Clause jurisprudence on the basis of what happens in spousal abuse cases.
05-547 +++$+++          Where --         Where are those sections?         Okay.         What are the sections -- (b)?         All right.         We have a case involving standing which says that -- you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the conceivable.    And this seems to me an exercise in the conceivable.    Nobody thinks your client is really, you know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's on supervised release in the United States, or is going -- is going to apply -- having been deported from the country for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in the -- these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable. This is just not the real world.         That depends on whether you consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised release, which is impossible once he leaves the country. Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a realistic consequence of the prior conviction.          Do you think there's a realistic possibility that this person is going to be readmitted?   A realistic possibility?          Oh.          Do you think there's a realistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted, so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised release?          Has he applied for such a visa? Has he expressed any intention to apply?          Well --          -- then it's an exercise in the conceivable, it seems to me.        Is there any indication that that's in the works, or is this just another conceivable thing?        Yes.
05-593 +++$+++            I don't understand why anyone would want to come out the way you urge us to come out.   Why would it make any sense to give a Federal employee the benefit of trial in Federal court when he committed the act, and then you debate about whether it was, whether there was liability or not, and yet deprive him of the benefit of a Federal court when he denies that he did anything at all?            Why would you want one set of cases to remain in the State court and the other set of cases to go to Federal court?           Well, I mean, that's what we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some ambiguity in it.   There being ambiguity, why should we find a line that doesn't make any sense?            But that can happen when in fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out to be wrong and there isn't any immunity.            Still, the whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.          Mr. Grant, these items we've been discussing are perhaps the more important features of the case.      But your argument in your brief didn't begin with those.       It began with the assertion that there is no jurisdiction to review the district court's remand order at all.             I take it you're not abandoning that, are you?          Then why was it first in your brief and not first in your argument?           I would have thought your answer would have been even if, even if the remand was improper, even if it is the case that, what is it, (d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal court.    Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of review.   I mean, we said in other cases that even when the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.
05-595 +++$+++                Habeas is an equitable --               Habeas is equitable relief and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?               I assume that's how we got to Teague.               Well, I assume there would be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state court.               If indeed our law had changed; don't you think?               I mean, it's inconceivable that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by the state court that rendered the decision.              You're saying not just "clearly"; "then clearly established law."              That is, at the time of the state court decision. *END STENO               Exactly.         But you know, how you play the game depends upon at what level of generality you describe the right.                   And I agree with you if you describe the right as the right to cross-examination, that -- that was -- reinstituted by Crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a right to confrontation -- to cross-examination, which didn't exist before.        I mean, you could dispense with that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of reliability.               I'm not sure that you can so -- in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock principle.     Frankly, I don't know any formula that would -- that would describe it.                 I really think it is a -- you know it when you see it.               It is like obscenity. (laughter.)
05-5966 +++$+++          But it doesn't go to premeditation.           I think that's Justice Ginsburg's point.       And I don't see why that isn't correct.           It doesn't got to premeditation.         No, but you're saying -- you're saying he could have been charged with second- degree murder --         -- because -- what?         Does not require premeditation.           And I --         -- don't see how this goes to premeditation, anyway.
05-5992 +++$+++          The delay -- the delay was not because we can't try this man because he's incompetent, and until he's rendered competent, we -- we have to stay proceedings.                 That wasn't the basis at all.      It was just I haven't made up my mind yet.         Which is what is specifically precluded by the requirement that -- that you act within 30 days, and -- and all the rest of the time, the clock is running.         And you think it's -- it's not harmless error if they didn't make the finding but -- but could have?         He didn't think he needed it.      He had a perpetual waiver.         Mr. Zas, are you going to talk about estoppel?            Well, I can.          Did he ask for a perpetual waiver?              I thought the way the colloquy went, the judge said, no, you know, I can't give you a waiver unless you'll -- unless you'll make it a perpetual waiver. And then he said, okay, I'll make it a perpetual waiver.              Wasn't -- wasn't the -- the initiative for the perpetual waiver from -- from the court?         Okay.         And Gothic print, right?         I guess you can be -- I'm sorry, go ahead.
05-608 +++$+++             Excuse me, I don't -- I don't understand what you just said.             You mean, it would be enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis for dismissing the suit.        Is that --            Okay.               So, then it is enforceable.              You -- well, you can have such a dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know, the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that doesn't create a case or controversy.                      What is the injury, the imminent injury to your -- to your client that is the basis for the case or controversy?              Is it anything other than, "I have to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay."?              Is it -- is it unlawful to agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?             I mean, you're speaking as though somehow that -- such a contract is contrary to public policy, and void.             Contractually?       They say that that's their contractual right?            Where does that appear in the licensing agreement?        Or --            Yes, I took them as just asserting a general proposition of law -- that, where they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties -- not because there's some special provision in this contract.            So, there's really not much at issue in this case.       And that's clearly a case of controversy, isn't it?        There is a dispute over the meaning of that provision of the agreement.           Gee, there's less here than meets the eye.              And what would their -- what would their concrete injury be?               What is the threatened imminent injury that they would assert in that -- in that action?            You have a licensee who's paying the license fees.         What is their concrete injury?            But --            -- so long as they're still paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract disagreement?   I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying that the patent's invalid.          You know, it's a nice theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete injury?            I --            I find it --            I --            I find it --            -- very difficult --            -- to see how there would be a proper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee here.   It's just not the kind of a situation where you can have a mirror-image suit.          I don't see what the --            -- patentee --            That's fine.              Wait, wait.          Before you leave that, do you agree that it was not raised below?              Where -- can you tell us where it was raised below?
05-6551 +++$+++          That would be an erroneous instruction, I assume.         You either have to have an erroneous instruction or a special verdict.         Right.           I think your answer would be that how could it possibly be reasonable except for the consideration of some additional fact?                      What makes it reasonable other than facts?                Atmosphere?        I mean --           Somebody on that side suggested it.   That to talk about the fact that there's a lot of crime in the community as an aggravating factor doesn't make any sense.    Aggravating factor means something that makes the crime that this person committed worse, not the need for punishment greater, but makes the crime worse. Now, if that is not your answer, what is the answer that you gathered, from the left of me?            To say that a sentence within the guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable.                 So under the Federal system, it is perfectly possible -- unless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to be affirmed, because although the guideline range is reasonable, there are other systems that would be reasonable, right?           Or they could say the middle term will always be reasonable.           Couldn't they say that?
05-669 +++$+++         I think your point has to be that there are administrative proceedings that are not actions.        Right.        You contend that what commenced the action here was the order demanding payment.        That's a very weird commencement of an action, where what then follows is what is referred to as an "appeal," within the agency.         Which says that?         What page of your brief?         Of the reply.         I'm not finding it.    Where is it, again?           Why is -- why doesn't it make much more sense -- as I understand the proceeding, this order doesn't come out of the blue.               As required, there has to be a letter to the -- to the payee saying, "We think -- we think you owe so much money."               He is allowed to respond, right?           And then, after considering the response, the order issues.           Now, I would consider that a -- you know, an -- that sounds to me like a complaint and an opportunity to respond to it.            And then, finally, the first decision of the agency, which is then appealed -- and CFR provides for an -- what he calls an appeal.              And it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the opinion on the appeal.           Well, it doesn't --           -- waive it, but it can't issue the order without having issued the letter first, giving --          -- giving the party an opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.          Is there anything that requires the order?          Yes.          Well --          So, you could say the same for the other.          You don't -- you don't -- but you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from the order.          It seems to me crazy to call that order a complaint.        I -- even if I grant your other argument, that an administrative proceeding can be commenced by a complaint -- or that the term "complaint" can apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think that what you've hung your hat on here -- namely, the order -- seems to    me to fit that description.         I doubt whether --         -- that would --         I doubt whether that would conform with the Administrative Procedure Act.        I mean, either -- even at the first level of agency decision --         -- it seems to me you have to give the individual an opportunity to reply.         Of course you can ignore it. That doesn't prove anything.              You could ignore an agency complaint, too --           -- I mean, a formal complaint, in which case you'll be found liable.              What does --           -- the fact that you don't have to respond have to do with anything?           Well, you --           -- you'd win in this case even if it did.   I don't think that the difference between the initial letter giving you an opportunity to reply, and the -- what you call the "complaint," the               order -- that time period doesn't put you out of -- out of the permissible period.        Right.        Yes.         Well, 2415(a), (i), we -- you, you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial actions, can you?         Yes.         And that's in --         -- and that's in title 28.            Yes.           What --           They could have said -- if the other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have said the provisions of this section do not apply to administrative proceedings --           -- which would have -- which would have handled the offset --           -- but would have been well beyond the offset.    And the fact --           -- that they only focus on the offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.            I can believe that they do --            But --            By mistake.        But I would not assume a mistake unless it's very clear.         Well, that's true.       That's true.   But the provision you're arguing that you come under does talk about a complaint.         And that's what -- you know, that's what starts the 6 years running.            And it's -- seems to me odd to call something a "complaint" which is, in fact, an order.   They're not complaining about anything; they're saying, "Pay the money."         You know, usually a complaint, you're -- you make your point, and say, "What do you say? What's your answer?"         And this is an order.       "You're -- boom, "Pay."         Well, that's only true if you consider an appeal to be the response.          And that's rather weird, that --         -- that the response to a complaint is an appeal.           Could you get us -- we're going to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion. Could you -- could you get us a -- you know, a sample of an agency letter?    Or, if you can't, maybe the Government can?           What --           What other areas would we be messing up by finding for you?            I mean, here, you know, if we don't find that this administrative action is covered by this statute of limitations, there's no statute of limitations.    But there may -- there are other -- may be other areas covered by this text -- namely, a suit by the United States -- founded upon any contract expressly or implied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a statute of limitations.         And that would prevail over this --         -- because it's more --         -- specific.
05-705 +++$+++          But they have made it that, haven't they, in a later regulation?             Haven't they said just that.         In a later order, yes.        Are rate making regulations issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's definition of what is just and reasonable compensation?        They are issued under 201.        So they are an interpretation of the statutory language in 201.        And you say this one is not.          You say it would be a reasonable practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of the regulation.          Before you go back, let's hear about the accounting rules.             What would they be issued under?    Would they be issued under 201?        It seems to me accounting rules -- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you have to have accounting rules.             So the accounting rules fit very comfortably under 201.
05-7053 +++$+++           I would think that it's easier in -- you know, we had -- we had a -- this term another case in which the argument is that you cannot have a separate insanity defense essentially and -- and exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the -- the lack of -- of mental capacity to -- to have that mens rea.      This is the same thing you're arguing before us. And -- and it seems to me that if it applies to duress, it applies even -- even more strongly to -- to insanity.         How can an insane person form the intent to commit a crime that -- that requires mens rea?          It was her will to yield to the will of someone else.               I mean, you can't blame somebody else for her making the choice.          That may be a very intelligent choice on your part to do what the person with the gun at the head of your children tells you to do.      But to say that it's not your choice, which is what you're arguing here, the only question is whether that has to be brought forward by reason of -- of a defense of -- of coercion or rather, whether it goes to whether you had the intent. That's all we're talking about here.              And it seems to me you have the intent to yield to -- to the demand of whoever has the gun at the head of your children.                It's a separate question whether the law should punish your yielding like that.            But -- but you're telling us that you don't have the intent to -- to yield and -- and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you. Right? That just doesn't -- I just don't think it's true.          And you have 21 States and how many circuits --          No.     I'm saying how many are on the other side?           Well, that's -- that's sort of a horse race.             I'm -- I'm not sure, even if I agreed with your theory, that -- that what the Constitution requires changes on the basis of an evolving common law. Of course, it can only change in one direction.          Right?    It can only change favorably to -- to your client, favorably to the defendant.                   It can't change to be more harsh to the defendant because the Constitution prohibits that.           Right?      So -- so we have a one-way -- a one-way altering Constitution.           But even -- even if I agreed with that, I'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is -- is an overwhelming demonstration of -- of the new common law.           29 versus 14.          Mr. Jett, a thought occurred to me, by reason of your agreement, that -- that it's a one-way ratchet, that when the common law changes in the -- in the direction of favoring the defendant, it becomes the duty of the courts to allow that.                   But, of course, it can't change in the other direction because the Constitution would prevent it.                    You sort of agreed with that. But -- but if -- if you agree with that, how can you explain our -- our 1895 decision in Davis which held that the insanity defense had to be proved by the Government which was then overridden by a Federal statute.         How could -- how could -- if -- if Davis was right about what the -- what the common law required, how could Congress possibly have changed that by a statute?         I would assume that all of the basic elements of the common law are picked up in the Due Process Clause.        Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't the necessity of -- of proving the mental element of a -- of a crime, even when that mental element is overcome by insanity, why wouldn't that have been embodied in the Due Process Clause so that the congressional statute would have been ineffective?          No.     I'm not questioning whether we could do it.              I'm questioning whether Congress could do it, whether Congress could overrule what we did in Davis.             If Davis said that common law was that the Government has to prove -- disprove insanity, wouldn't that have been part -- become part of the Due Process Clause if it was the common law?          Right.          Well, it makes me suspect that Davis was wrong.            And three -- three was what? Three States that have adopted it --            By statute.            I'm not sure it's less -- less blameworthy.             I mean, if somebody has a gun to the head of my child and I have a choice between doing a criminal act that he wants me to do and shooting him, you think it's -- the less blameworthy is to go do the criminal act?            I wouldn't kill him.     I'd just wound him. (Laughter.)
05-7058 +++$+++               Well, I guess this is probably not a question for you, but a question for your friend on the other side.          You can ask, why does it hurt?   You can also ask why does it help?                What good does it do to bounce the whole thing back when you're just going to have them filed again?                 You would have no problem, I assume, if the state simply requires that you name the individuals?                 To the extent possible, I suppose.                 Then, then there would not be exhaustion unless he had named the individuals.                 So we may not be, may not be litigating about a whole lot here.             It requires, it requires response in all the cases, and as this subsection G indicates, part of the purpose of the act was to eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous complaints.    Why -- why, you know, you have to go through the requesting a response from the government, when in fact there is nothing to this complaint because there has never been any exhaustion.             That's a different argument.    But I mean, don't tell me that it isn't more efficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether it's exhausted or not.        It certainly is.
05-746 +++$+++        Except that the -- what was it, the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the negligence of the defendant. The basis for that holding was that in whole or in part language which is used for the negligence of the defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence. So if you believe that that case was at least decided for the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.        But nobody does --       Except we've rejected petitions for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times. Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers required.    You --       Do you really expect to get five votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50 years?       But you were wise enough not to ask for that. (Laughter)      Rogers said, in whole or in part. Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it. But Rogers said that it did it.
05-785 +++$+++          To apply an opinion of this Court to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not necessarily to say that that is clearly established Supreme Court law.      It just means that it is their best guess as to how it comes out, right?         I mean, they're forced to decide it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either means this or that.       They're not applying a clearly established test to the Supreme Court, are they?            Well, you also don't allow people to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats. Everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the trial; isn't that right?           Maybe that's why we don't allow banners, because a courtroom is not the place for banners.          I wish you hadn't said that. Because I had thought that one of the things that made this case leaning in your direction is the fact that merely having a picture of their loved one on the button doesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant, or even convict the defendant.             It just conveys, at most, to the jury, you know, this is -- we have been deprived of someone we love, you should take this matter very seriously and consider the case carefully.                It is an important matter to us.       And therefore, you ought to deliberate carefully.     I don't know that it means anything more than that.         You said, you know, convict what's -- or hang What's His Name.                That's quite -- you're equating that with the buttons in this case.                  And I don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and so, or even convict so and so.             They just say we have been deprived of a loved one.            This is a terrible matter. Please, jury, consider this case carefully.                That's all it necessarily says.            I thought some states require that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their case to the jury for harsh penalty.                       I don't know that that's necessarily inappropriate to know that the --         Yes, yes.
05-83 +++$+++        Was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime?       Well, you -- you could -- it could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding. If, as you tell us, there are two categories, one being deadly weapon, which does not include firearm, and the other being firearm, wouldn't you say that the jury verdict positively contradicted?       The judge doesn't have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt, does he?       I don't understand what -- what you meant by a facial unconstitutional -- facially unconstitutional problem.            You mean a Federal court would enjoin the criminal prosecution because it's unconstitutional on its face?              We wouldn't do that, would we?       Neither can I.       So that -- that's not really an adequate answer, that it would be facially unconstitutional.          Mr. Whisman, can I -- can I ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker form what the -- what your colleague here says this case involves? Suppose that -- that you have a statute, a murder statute, which applies to the murder of a single individual, but -- but you have another statute with a death penalty called aggravated murder.                   And it's a different crime and it -- it requires the -- the killing of more than one person in -- in the same -- in the same event. Let's assume a trial in which somebody came into a bank with a machine gun.                  Only one person came in, and five people were killed.                   But the prosecution only brought a prosecution for simple murder.                   Okay? And the jury comes back with a verdict for -- for simple murder. Certainly a judge would not be able to say, well, no jury could possibly have found simple murder here without also thinking that this person was guilty of -- of this greater offense of -- of aggravated murder and, therefore, I'm going to enter a judgment of aggravated murder. That's what the -- the defense says happened here, that there was just a verdict of -- of the lesser offense.         That's all the jury found.            It could have found more and maybe -- maybe in finding that, it -- it must have thought that the greater offense also existed, but it never came in with a verdict for the greater offense. Now, tell me why what happened here is different from -- from the hypothetical.
05-848 +++$+++             It is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer.     In fact, the director of the PSD program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took.            Rightly so, I think.   I mean, it was the earliest, application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program.            Well, whatever the reason he gave, was it -- these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these -- were those opinions already out there?            I understand that, and I think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the PSD regulations.         But what I am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed. They don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor.           And then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.             We've wrestled with these things for several days.        It's disappointing to hear you tell us they're clear.            Right.      In deciding whether the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper for a court to take into account that the regulations must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD definition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS definition?     I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory -- or regulatory construction. Cannot a court give great weight to that in interpreting these ambiguous regulations?             Well, I don't think the same argument has necessarily to be made, but the question still before us is how you interpret the regulations.    Let's assume that's just a regulatory interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.             But in deciding that, whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that we're entitled to take into account the necessity that the regulations comply with the statute.             And if they are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the direction that it seems to us would provide consistency with the statute.     Now does that violate the jurisdictional bar?           Why was that rejection wrong?     Because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction.                Is it conceivable that when Congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else. I mean, to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing.          Of course it does, but when Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.          Well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same.           Entirely meaningless.             Mr. Hungar, I'm curious. What happens if you have a new company that wasn't around when the regulation was issued?          Can it -- can it bring a challenge to the conformity of the regulation to the statute?             Well, a nice question.     I mean, all you have to do is find a stalking horse.            Just have some new company carry your water for you.           Well, the one in part 52 surely does.    You have to give them that.           You don't give them that.            Where is "rate" defined? I'm still troubled by 52.01(b).           Where is -- you say "rate" is defined.    Where?             It's not defined.         You say it's just used that way.
05-85 +++$+++                Removal.        Removal was-                 You said remand was proper. That's the --               But we go into that question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity.              I mean, if in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to be able to appeal every case.               That would be fine if 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it says.               Well, you're into your backup argument now.               The backup argument that you're now making, that not your principal argument.              They don't care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not.                   It's not an essential part of their case.               Their case is even if it did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end of case.              That's their backup argument, I think.             It's -- it's the same with diversity jurisdiction.         You can make the same argument. There's nothing distinctive here.                 This statute says that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a right to be tried in Federal court.                      Fine.   But the statute also says that if you're a defendant in a diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal court. And I don't know why this is any more demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're entitled to trial in federal court.             How is that relevant here? Where is the post-removal event?             Well, that's not an event. That's -- that's an epiphany, it's not an event. (Laughter.)             Very strange meaning of event.               I mean the sovereign immunity didn't exist from the outset.                      Nothing changed.               When did it say that?             I really find it very hard to accept that argument, when its says -- you know -- it doesn't use lacks removal jurisdiction, that's what it means.                      It is such an easy thing to say.
05-8794 +++$+++           Which you decline to specify.         Right?          By a means which you decline to specify, so that if they come up with some other means, you could -- you could object to that as well I assume.          No, I understand that.      But I'm just -- I'm just pointing out what -- what becomes available to you if we -- if we give you the relief you request.          You -- we -- we say this -- this procedure is no good.                The State comes up with another procedure, and you challenge that one.                  Right? And -- and another few years go by.           Why?           You -- you think that the -- the way you would proceed in trial court is the trial court finds that this is no good, and -- and then the trial court proposes an alternative, or -- or invites the State to propose to the trial court an alternative, and then asks whether you agree to that alternative. And if you don't, the trial court makes the decision whether the alternative is -- is constitutional or not.           That's not bad.          In this very case, you're saying the court would -- would rule on the State's proposed alternative.             Right?          But if you disagreed with that, you could appeal it up again.                       Right?   You can go to the court of appeals --          -- and then seek cert up here.       Right?          Is it only excruciating pain that the Eighth Amendment prohibits or is it any pain? Does the Eighth Amendment require painless execution?          Well, when you say wanton and gratuitous, you're -- you're saying any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated.                     Otherwise, it's gratuitous I assume.          Yes.     So if there's any way of -- of execution that is totally painless, that -- that must be pursued.          Where -- where do you derive that from?          I mean, gee, you know, that -- that was certainly never the principle evident in -- in executions in the past.                Hanging was -- was not a -- you know, a quick and easy way to go.                       You would have thought they would have required a firing squad instead or something like that.                I -- I just don't know where you're deriving this principle that there cannot be any pain associated with the execution.            I can understand excruciating pain, but -- but you -- you want to press it to the point where there can't be any pain associated.              Any pain that can be eliminated must be eliminated.              That seems to me a very extreme proposition.            No.     I understand what you're challenging here.                 But what -- what alternative would be acceptable to you?                  Only one -- only one that -- that, to the maximum extent possible, eliminates all pain.       Isn't that right?           Well, but -- but you -- you -- their procedure was set forth in a -- in a notice, a regulation or something.                You -- you had notice of what procedure they intended to use several years ago, didn't you?           Now, you're saying they could change it in the future, but sure, of course. Any -- any agency can change its -- its regulations. But didn't you know that this is the procedure they intended to use several years ago?            So you have to wait to -- you have to wait to the eve of execution before -- before you think you have a -- a ripe claim under -- under habeas.            Congress has the complete discretion to change the statutes it's enacted, but that doesn't mean that you can't change -- you can't challenge a statute now because it might be changed before -- before the action you want to take occurs. You can challenge it now.                 And it seems to me it's the same thing with the method of execution prescribed by -- by an administrative agency in -- in a State.          I don't understand.     How did you get into the court if you didn't know what protocol they were going to use?          You say you didn't know it until the 19th when your case was already in the court. What -- what were you challenging?          Excuse me.        How did the trial court get into it?               Does the records request go through -- through a trial court?          What -- what is the -- the action that you're bringing?                 An action for records request?           Well, they still do, but you're here.             I mean, they -- they still have the opportunity to change it, but you're here challenging it even though it is still changeable.                     Right?          Suppose -- suppose they did set it forth but reserved the right to change it.                 They promulgated a regulation without public notice, without hearings or anything.             This is our regulation.     This is how we intend to conduct executions in the future. Period.        We reserve the right to change this.          Would you claim that -- that this was not ripe?                 You couldn't challenge it at that point --          -- because they could change it?            No.     This is the current method that we intend to use in all future executions. Period. We may change our mind.            Don't -- don't you think you -- you --            -- don't you think effectively had that knowledge when you knew -- knew about Sims and you knew about all of the cases after Sims?       Is that very much short of -- of their saying this is the -- the procedure we intend to use?
05-8820 +++$+++                You're saying the application is the application -- the petition for certiorari is the application?               Well, we can't act on it unless, unless it's final.          We, we need final action by the state court, don't we?               How can it be final action and yet still be pending?               It's final as far as the application for state review is concerned.               Which is the text that we're dealing with here.             I guess you could also say that except in capital cases the defendant will not have an incentive to delay.       He wants to get out, right?
05-908 +++$+++                  You would object, then, to magnet schools?     You would object to any system that is designed to try to cause people voluntarily to go into a system that is more racially mixed?                 No, I understand.         But I'm trying to find what, you know, the outer limits of your contentions are.     It doesn't seem to me that your briefs indicated that you would object to something like magnet schools.   The -- even if one of the purposes of those schools is to try to cause more white students to go to schools that are predominantly non-white.                    It's just voluntary, I mean, but the object is to achieve a greater racial mix.               I understand.              Why do you agree that this is not an affirmative action case?                  Is it not?   Wherein does it differ?    I thought that the school district was selecting some people because they wanted a certain racial mix in the schools, and were taking the affirmative action of giving a preference to students of a certain race.    Why isn't -- why doesn't that qualify as affirmative action?              Well, I don't know what else it is.    What do you think it is that causes you to seemingly accept the characterization that this is not it?              I thought there was a criterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever school you want.    You are allowed to go to a certain choice of school.    The criterion was your choice.             Of course they're not. That's why some of them were oversubscribed.                   That's why others were undersubscribed.             General Clement, is there anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of the races and establishing policies which achieve that result but which do not single out individuals and disqualify them for certain things because of their race?   Is there anything wrong with a policy of wanting to have racial mix?

05-9264 +++$+++             But you wouldn't analyze it on the basis of whether this defendant started up the ladder.   As I understand, you would -- you have to analyze it on the basis of whether generically attempted burglary as a whole presents a serious enough risk; isn't that the way it has to be done?            But even if it would, that's only one manner of attempt.                And it seems to me, if you're going to do it generically, you have to look over the whole scope of possible attempts and say does the whole scope of possible attempts bear, I would say, a similar risk of the use of physical force as do the specifically mentioned crimes of burglary, arson or extortion?   Indeed, I guess you have to use the least dangerous.   Wouldn't you say extortion is probably, of those mentioned crimes, burglary, arson, extortion, or the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct. Now that "otherwise", that refers me back to the crimes already mentioned, and I would say that means that the unnamed crime has to have a similar risk, at least a risk as high as the least dangerous of the crimes mentioned, which I would take to be extortion. Wouldn't you say?            And what's a potential risk, by the way?            A potential potential?      I mean, every risk is potential, isn't it?           You think potential risk is just risk really?           It would also keep the professors from other mischief. (Laughter.)            I guess we have to decide how many attempts involve that kind of initial action, which doesn't seem very physical threatening, and how many of them involve putting a ladder up against the side of the house. How do we possibly figure that out, to decide whether as a whole the degree of risk from attempted burglary is as high as at least the degree of risk from extortion?              Mr. Crawford, if you had that meaning in mind, you would not have used the word "otherwise".   You would have simply said is burglary, arson or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk. The other purpose of the "otherwise," which means in some other manner, some other manner -- other from what? Other from the preceding ones. I don't think there is any sensible way to read it except, you know, in some other manner than these previously named crimes involves a physical risk; and that is what causes me to say, well, what's the least dangerous of the previously mentioned crimes, and any crime you want to get into this residual category has to be at least as dangerous as that.                 As I've said, I think that's extortion.           Mr. Crawford, we've held that the named crimes have to be considered generically according to their elements, right?              Burglary, arson. Have we ever held that the residual category or "otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury," that that has to be decided generically?    I mean, if we could apply that residual category, not generically but according to the crime that was actually tried and of which the defendant has been convicted, such as laying a ladder up against the house, that particular sort of burglary, it seems to me it would be a much easier, much easier case, wouldn't it?   We'd be able to tell whether there was a serious risk of physical injury. Is there any obstacle to doing that?               Was it referring to the residual category?               Maybe it's not too late to save ourselves from sending out legions of law professors to do studies.            Don't you think attempted use of explosives is at least as dangerous as extortion? I mean as far as the risk of physical injury is concerned, I would think attempted use of explosives is much more dangerous to physical health than extortion.
05-983 +++$+++                What can the parents get out of this case other than reimbursement for the tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural rights that are given them by the Act?                 What can they get out of this case other than those two things that do not depend upon their status as representatives of the child?                  What other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the Act?            What other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child?                  It depends upon their being a party aggrieved.      That is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.                  Now if the only remedies the parents are entitled to in their own right are reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to appear pro se be limited to those two categories?               You'd win this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the rule that you're urging us to adopt?              The child is.       The child is entitled to an appropriate public education and the parents are entitled to have it provided free.                 That's really the only interest they have on the table, it seems to me, separate and apart from their status as representatives or guardians of the child.              You know, it's not an insignificant matter at issue here.                       Counsel, who are referred to as officers of the court, protect the court from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no basis.    When we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a lot more work for Federal district judges.                       Why should we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual result?               These disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) and all that stuff?     I find that hard to believe.          I mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are the people least likely to have familiarized themselves with the statute and the procedures.              And do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions, right?                  You'd have a nice evening's work.                I think you quoted from 4(a).             Well, then you still haven't said anything.        I thought you were saying that they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied procedures.    But if all the procedures are given and they're still not satisfied with the public education that is given, they would not be able to sue claiming that it was inadequate under the terms of the Act. You think they can sue then, too, as well.              Well, you haven't said anything then.              You really haven't limited the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.              Fine.       You've given the procedure but where does the Act guarantee the parents the proper outcome?     The proper -- assignment?             It does give the parents the right procedures explicitly and the rights to reimbursement for -- for private tuition.             And that right, where -- where is that right contained?              You have given us citations for the other ones.             Where is that right contained?             The right to initiate a suit solely on the basis -- not that I was denied procedures, not that I, I paid money for private schooling, but I do not believe the outcome, the education given to my child in the public school was enough.              They have the right -- they have the right to the hearing.             But do they have the right --              Do they have a right in and of themselves -- not as guardians -- do they have the right to a particular outcome in the hearing?             That's, that's the point I'm inquiring to.
05-996 +++$+++               They're not at issue as far as this mootness question goes.           I mean, you're seeking to have the right to file under 13. And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to file under 13, you're asking for the impossible.           The case is simply -- you know -- it's just air.           So I guess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is still on appeal.   Should we not take as a given that there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you can apply under Chapter 13.           It doesn't make any sense.             Well, didn't you make that argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you were not eligible?             That's what I'm asking.       A Chapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor presumably does.   So didn't you make the same argument to the bankruptcy court.             And they rejected it?             I don't care about the present case.   I care about the Chapter 13 case in which you have been found not to qualify for Chapter 13 treatment.    Didn't you make before that court the same argument you're making now that some of the debts shouldn't be counted.          They rejected it, right?          And they rejected it?          But you said it was only a Chapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.          But you are applying under Chapter 13.          Didn't you object to that and say you should look at these claims afresh?          And what did the court say? Did it say it had to or that it did so and still found them over the limit.          What did the bankruptcy court say?          I don't understand that. But did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for Chapter 13 treatment?          Of course you are.      They've rendered a decision.      How could you not be finished with the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has rendered a final decision.             It is terribly confusing. It seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had the responsibility for determining whether you qualified under the, you know, under the amount of debt.             And you objected to that, I gather?            You objected to that, to that ruling?            Mr. -- Mr. Baker, I have -- I have a question on a matter that really upsets me and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can rely upon your description here.            You claimed in the petition that the reason your client filed under Chapter 7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time. And that he decided to go to 13 after he became employed. Yet, on -- as shown in the supplemental appendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty of perjury, he said that he was employed, and at the meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath that he was employed. What was it?      Was he employed or not employed?           It says employment, occupation, name of employer:             Capital Carpet and Flooring.     How long employed, five months.             Address of employment:     Woburn, Massachusetts.             It also says the same thing on page 18 of the supplemental appendix.                   And also with the meeting of creditors.                If you look at the joint appendix at 64a, he says the same thing that he was employed.    Was he employed or not employed?           Does he go around swearing he was when he wasn't?            Look on page 64a of the appendix, the meeting of creditors.              Trustee says okay, and you now work for another entity, Capital Carpet and Flooring, sir?   And Mark Marrama says yes.           I'm not sure I understood what you just said.     You said until the plan is filed and approved the property remains in the possession of the Chapter 13 trustee.
05-998 +++$+++               Excuse me, you mean you can never decide this question until after the trial is completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a reasonable doubt?            Now why would there be any difference then?    That's a question I was about to put to you.   What if there is no indictment at all?             Why couldn't you say the same thing?            Well, you know, the only purpose of getting it is to see if there was probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.            I don't think it's pushing it, I think it's there.          Mr. Dreeben, if we disagree with you here, could this defendant be retried?                 Could he be reindicted?              Mr. Dreeben, is attempt a lesser included offense of the substantive offense of illegal reentry?
06-1005 +++$+++               Where -- so what?              Is there some rule up there that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as possible?              I think it -- I think it much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than that, that Congress would want to make all -- all betting operations like this a violation automatically of two criminal statutes.              I find that sort of, you know, very strange.              Oh well, I mean -- come on. Nobody -- nobody runs a gambling operation without paying off the winners.        It's not going to last very long.               To make the paying off of the winners a separate crime from running the gambling operation seems to me quite extraordinary.               But even if --              It will solve a lot them. And unless you're willing to come in and say, yes, do it to us, give us a narrower definition of concealment and a narrower definition of what's a transaction, but you're not willing to do that.             You're going to stretch that as broadly as you can.               You might well reject it if you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds.                   I mean, that rejection was connected with its acceptance of a narrow definition of proceeds.                     And if you're asking us to obliterate the latter, I don't know why it isn't reasonable to send it back to the Seventh Circuit and say, well, you still said the same thing if you came out differently on the proceeds question.             I find that extraordinary. You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing. I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad.              Straighten that out in the definition of the crime, rather than in the --              What continues?      The business has to continue.            You are not engaging in a gambling business if you're not paying off the winners. That's all.    That's not a good decent honest gambling business. (Laughter.)              Because gambling under the definition has the three elements that do not include paying off the winners.        That's what it all represents --              Of course it is.
06-10119 +++$+++               The district judge is in a much better position to decide those matters, such as you know, he -- his -- his response was -- was slow on -- one the question of, you know, whether he could consider the death penalty.              I can't tell that from a cold record, and that's why we -- rely upon the trial judge.             Right.              Well, these are peremptory challenges.    It seems to me if you have one -- one juror who says I think I could and another one who said I could, I'm going to strike the one who said I think I could.              Did all 21 say I think I could?             I don't understand how the dean could resolve his problem.              The man's problem, what he's worried about is that he has to put in a certain number of hours of teaching.              And what was it?         A couple of months before the end of the term?                     It was going to be very --              Whatever.        He had to be there to observe.     He had to put in a certain number of hours.     How could the dean say oh, don't worry, it's no problem?              The hours requirement is a requirement for the degree.              I don't think deans have the ability to -- to waive degree requirements.              Maybe the dean was just saying oh, he'll be able to do it, and --              -- that wouldn't inspire a great deal of confidence in me, even if I said okay.              My reaction would be -- would depend on how he said okay.                 And if I were sitting there as the trial judge, I -- I could discern whether okay meant well, you know, that's what he says but I'm still going to have a hard time digging out those hours for the remaining time that I have in the term.                 I don't know how he said okay.                 Even if the assurance is only secondhand, right?                 When the dean says it's okay, that's all right.             It sounds like the right answer to me. (Laughter.)              What does that have to do with anything?              So he broke his promise.    I mean sue him or something, but I don't see how it has anything to do with whether a fair jury was -- was --              Well, that's not just racially polarizing.      I mean maybe it is that, but it is also a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife.               The same as here.               And then feigned a mental illness by his -- his great-escape escapade, and that is -- that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to bring before the jury.                 Another reason to do it would be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to those jurors.             Maybe your rule here that -- that we're not going to postulate the worst reason for a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason when you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to set forth a good reason.
06-102 +++$+++               It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the arbitration clause did not apply?              It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply.              I don't see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.                It was not, not felicitously put.     I think all the Court was saying was that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction. The only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction. And so you do not have to -- but that doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine.                It is a doctrine that overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction.                          In that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.             Now, why is that?           Now -- to some extent this is a call for the district judge. There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's entirely conceivable that one district judge would correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens whereas another district judge faced with the same question would not do so.          And both of them would be acting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?
06-1037 +++$+++                 You're saying you're one step removed.   You're making your determination on the basis of eligibility for retirement, which in turn is based on age.   And you're saying that that --                Huh?                Right.             You'd be in better shape if it was in legislative history and not in the preamble. We probably would take it into account.
06-1082 +++$+++                  Mr. MCCullough, the proposition that you're arguing, does it apply at the Federal level as well?        Suppose -- suppose I think that my neighbor next door is growing marijuana and I have probable cause to believe that, all right? So I go in and search his house; and sure enough, there is marijuana.              And I bring it to the police's attention, and they eventually arrest him. Is that lawful search?              I'm a State actor, I guess. You know -- (Laughter.)              -- should not be living next door to somebody growing marijuana.                 It doesn't seem right.              Don't dance around.       Is it -- is it rendered an unreasonable search by the fact that I'm not a law enforcement officer at all?               So any Federal employee can go crashing around conducting searches and seizures?               So long as he has probable cause?               Do you really think that?               Or that you are an administrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of Customs?    It doesn't matter?               What about a janitor? You're a janitor, a federally employed janitor.               His neighbor is growing marijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court Justice would be.    Can he conduct a search?                 Wow.               Maybe we could say that in this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other situation where they had no arrest authority it would be.             I mean, you know, let's assume that the stop was not based on some, some deficiency in his license or some deficiency in the car -- I don't know what else it could be -- like, he had been going too fast, okay?              And it's just a misdemeanor.   He was five miles over the speed limit. Now, in that situation you couldn't say, as you've said here, gee, if they just let him go, he'd still be driving without a license; they had to arrest him; they had no choice.         In that situation, he wouldn't necessarily be going above the speed limit.                Would that be -- why couldn't you say it was reasonable here, but it wouldn't be reasonable there?             If that's the argument you're making, then don't bring forward the argument that they couldn't let him go because he'd be in violation of the law.      If you want us to make that narrow a holding, I guess we can.                Is that what you want us to do?                No, you're asking us to balance.   You're asking us to say, after all, in this case if they hadn't arrested he would have been violating the law as soon as they let him go.                You say this was not unlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor you brought forth?                Well, I don't know what you're talking about a discretionary call.                 It wasn't a discretionary call.       He couldn't arrest the person.               Does the person making the arrest at least have to have some arrest authority?               Or will a janitor do the job?   A janitor at the Justice Department becomes imbued with the mission of the Department and he goes around arresting people or searching people.             Just as this person here didn't have positive law authority to engage in an arrest.             Yes, but he was purporting to act in an official capacity.               And he did, indeed, give the marijuana to the officials at the Justice Department.                 Mr. MCCullough, what is here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite Cooper v. California, which I can't understand unless you agree with your friend that it has been overruled by later cases.                 I understand.     Why didn't you cite Cooper v.      California?
06-11206 +++$+++                There is really a problem about -- about what you suggest.               It may destroy the whole benefit of the categorical approach.               I mean, you can always shave something down to become a narrower crime.   An escape statute, for example, I suppose you could look to see whether the particular escape in question from the charging document was an escape that used firearms or was an escape that, you know, that injured or killed guards.          And, you know, that gets us into the case-by-case examination that it is the whole purpose of the categorical approach to avoid.               Now, how do we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that slippery slope?              Okay.      I mean, the charge mentions -- mentions a firearm.               Anything that's in the charge can be used to narrow the crime that we are looking at.              It has to be an element of the crime.    If using a firearm is not an element of escape, then I don't have to worry about it.              Okay, but it doesn't have to be an element.    So, if all the evidence in the case was that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and made his way out of the prison that way, if the jury found him guilty, that was the only basis on which it could have found him guilty, that would be enough.              Well, that sounds like an element.     That sounds like an element.             Surely it depends upon how, how, what should I say, how often that prospect is realized.             I mean, the statute itself lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any threat of injury, but all and all we think it does. Obviously, Congress thought it did, right?              I didn't mean to say robbery.   I meant to say burglary.                Why is burglary violent or aggressive?              I mean, burglary by its nature is--     you do it at night.              You don't want to be detected.     It's not violent or aggressive at all.              It's sneaky, is what it is.              Robbery is violent or aggressive.     You're quite right about that.              Yes, but -- that may be, but it does not in its nature indicate violence or aggressiveness.              It gets you right back into the soup.   What you're saying is all it requires is that there be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness, right?   And that's what the Government says here:              There is a potential for violence and aggressiveness.               That doesn't square with the answer you gave me with regard to burglary.                  If what you just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the listed crimes.               What was he serving those weekends for?   What was the crime?               He just gets weekends for that?   How many weekends?               Pretty good deal. (Laughter.)
06-11429 +++$+++               You say there are other examples where a -- a noun that is nested in another definition is separately defined and the two are read together.     How are those phrased?               I mean, I could understand what you say if this provision here read "The term 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year." Then I'd go back to the "felony" definition for what a felony means, but it doesn't repeat the "felony."                    "The term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for" -- do any of the examples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward read this way?              Which ones are they?        Where are they --             And --              Where would we find this?             I don't -- the definitional section contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).             Yes.      It contradicts it because the "felony" definition is classified as felony by Federal or State law.              Which is "under any provision of this subchapter or any other Federal law that prohibits or restricts."            And then in the last part, "under any law of a" -- of "State" -- it picks up "State" -- "or a foreign country."                "Foreign country" is not included in 802(13).              So you have to say that there "felony" stands on its own, right?             You think -- you think it would mean something different if you just left out the "regardless of" clause?             The "prior adult Federal or State conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year," you think it means something different without the "regardless".             Not at all?      Not possibly.              I would say that "regardless" clause is extraordinary and I would not want to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a regular basis.              How many statutes exist like that, my goodness?          You want the government to be held in all statutes to a level that is clear enough to satisfy the clear statement --              That's what the rule of lenity means.              Do our cases reflect what you're saying?   I thought our cases on the rule of lenity say that where there is an ambiguity you give the tie to the defendant.
06-11543 +++$+++               I think you can say that all of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and DUI doesn't; does it?              That's a big different, isn't it?              You've run away from me on "otherwise."     I think the "otherwise" ties the last paragraph to the -- to the preceding four enumerated crimes.    And if -- if it had just gone on to say "or presents a serious risk of injury" without the "otherwise," then I don't think you'd have any argument that you have to somehow look to the degree of injury, the -- the manner of injury that the four enumerated crimes have.     The "otherwise" ties it together, "or otherwise presents a risk of serious injury." And I think the implication is that the -- that the -- the injury must be similar to the -- at least in degree to the enumerated crimes beforehand.                  I wouldn't run away from the "otherwise."               I don't -- I don't understand this line of argue.              You would exclude, let's say, physical assault from -- from this, I mean assault with intent to kill, because it's not a property crime?               That wouldn't be included in the "otherwise involved"?
06-116 +++$+++                 Mr. Waxman, I thought the Ninth Circuit did decide that question in another case that was pending, Santos.                Why wasn't that the time at which it was clear that the Ninth Circuit no longer had jurisdiction?              Except that she is removable by election, and that is indeed what has happened.   And I understand that one of the issues in the election was precisely whether this borrowing authority existed or not.          And if that's the case, you have a new attorney general that presumably as an original matter would not do what the prior attorney general did.              So it is an intrabranch dispute that can be resolved by the electorate essentially.              Please don't. (Laughter.)
06-11612 +++$+++               Whose thumb is the magistrate under?    Is he under the thumb of Article I or Article II or Article III?               Who decides whether he stays on or she stays on as a magistrate?               So we're really not talking here about giving away any Article III power.            I mean, the magistrate is only subject to Article III.               That may well be, but the reason -- the reason presumably is that an Article III judge, which goes -- who goes through a much more substantial process of selection and confirmation is much more qualified.     Now, if you want to make that argument, that's fine, but that's a quite different argument from saying that we're giving away Article III powers to magistrates, right?            Magistrates are creatures of Article III.              You say it was the holding in Patton?              I suppose it was dicta.              I thought what Adams stood for was that the defendant can himself waive the right to jury without advice of counsel, that if he wants to do it on his own he can do it without counsel.                         It doesn't mean that if counsel does it without his objection at the time it's invalid.              I mean, yes, but -- everybody concedes that, but the question is by whom? Certainly very many rights, you will acknowledge, can be waived by counsel.              So you can't simply say it requires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that express and knowing waiver to the defendant. Sure, it does, but who has to be "express," and who has to be "knowing"?            That's the issue before us here.             Could I --             Are we supposed to go through every one of the rights that a defendant has in a trial one by one and decide, you know, this one the lawyer can make, this one the defendant must make personally?             One by one?           I mean, I never thought that that was the approach we take.             Could I just -- a question that has troubled me.       Basically, what you say that is of such importance here is the composition of a jury.                 I mean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to rule on the composition of the jury, should it be a magistrate or should it be an Article III judge.                But if -- you know, if that is -- is so fundamental that it needs a special rule that the waiver has to be personal by the defendant, then you can say the same thing about -- about objections to -- to the Court's failure to permit a strike for cause.         That affects the composition of the jury. Now do you need -- do you need the defendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point, or is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?              I see.           I see.
06-1164 +++$+++               Did the prior statutes have a different structure?              We've held this thing is jurisdictional for a long time.              Did the prior statutes under which we made those holdings have a different structure?                It seems to me all of those factors are a lot more subtle than the mere fact that we have said that this is jurisdictional for years and years, it and its predecessor.              Why -- why isn't that at least as persuasive as the -- as the fragile attachments you're -- you're discussing here or even as the -- as the, you know, the -- even if the statute said that it's jurisdictional, we've said in our opinions that to say it's jurisdictional doesn't mean that it's jurisdictional necessarily.             So I suppose we could say the same about the statute, couldn't we?               It didn't say that.     You're saying that.               Yes.              Mr. Haynes, isn't it less radical and, indeed, more in accord with the language of Irwin to -- to say that what Irwin overruled was not the whole principle that this statute of limitation is -- is -- and others that relate to sovereign immunity, is jurisdictional, but rather the much more limited rule that -- that statutes of limitations which are jurisdictional are not subject to equitable tolling? That's a much more limited point, and -- and the language of Irwin is a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed once Congress has made such a -- once Congress has made such a waiver, we think that making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government in the same way that it is applicable to private suits amounts to little, if any -- little, if any -- broadening of the congressional waiver. I don't think one can say that if you expand the principle to cover the whole -- the whole matter of whether it's jurisdiction.         So why not read Irwin more moderately to -- to -- if we have to overrule one of two things, the whole doctrine of the jurisdictional nature of statutes of limitations in sovereign immunity cases and the other is simply, oh, yes, there is sovereign immunity, but can there be equitable tolling, why shouldn't we adopt the more limited one?              You can usually count on the government to file the canned sovereign immunity brief. (Laughter.)
06-1181 +++$+++                 No, but he's not in the same circumstance.      I mean, he's made his choice.          He was offered voluntary departure, which had advantages. He could arrange his affairs and go when he wanted within 60 days.     What he gave up was the ability to appeal the determination. That doesn't seem to me as, as outrageous. I mean, it happens all the time.                 When a criminal defendant pleads to a lesser charge, he gives up the ability to appeal.      And that's what's going on here.                   He has gotten the advantage of a voluntary departure and given up the ability to appeal.                I don't bleed for him. It seems to me it's an option presented before him and he took it.                Still and all, it's part of the deal.   Even better.         Even better.             He hasn't even given up all his appeals.                It's just, part of the deal he gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's -- that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary departure.              That's what I thought.              But in your discussion with Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang around right through the appeal.              That's by regulation, though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of the country.              So I'm not following this. I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the government's new proposed system, in which the acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you file a reopening petition, right.                 So can the government then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also going to be stayed until, until completion of the reopening petition?              And that, that involuntary deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition for reopening, right?              Why are you willing to leave the involuntary deportees in that position, whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary deportees in that position, that their reopening petition just vanishes?       Why is it any fairer for the involuntary deportees than for the voluntary?           In fact it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made their choice.              Do you agree with counsel for the government as to how long it typically takes for these motions to reopen to be disposed of?                 He said something like 55 percent take, what, more than --              Your answer is yes, but the Attorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed rule would --
06-1195 +++$+++                 Who says that -- let's consider first the basis on which the court of appeals decided this case. They decided it -- in Rasul, we had held that the habeas statute extended to Guantanamo, and that those people who had filed their suits before the statute, at least, could bring a suit. Congress acted.           And enacted a new habeas statute which makes it very clear that the habeas statute, at least, does not apply to these people in Guantanamo. Your assertion here is that there is a common law constitutional right of habeas corpus that does not depend upon any statute. Do you have a single case in the 220 years of our country or, for that matter, in the five centuries of the English empire in which habeas was granted to an alien in a territory that was not under the sovereign control of either the United States or England.             What is -- what are they?             What cases -- what case in particular do you think in Rasul?             Mwenya involved an English -- an English subject, not an alien.             The question there is an alien.             So it's totally irrelevant.             In both of those cases, it was a citizen, nonetheless.           In 220 years of our history, or five centuries of the -- do you have a single case in which it was not a citizen of England or a citizen of the United States in which a common-law writ of habeas corpus issued to a piece of land that was not within the sovereign jurisdiction?               They were not regarded as part of the crown's dominion, but they were part of the crown's sovereign territory.               Okay, try them.      I mean, line them up. (Laughter.)               And the cases were decided under a statute that applied in India, not under -- under the common law. And the writ did not come from England; the writ came from English courts in India under a statute. And we decided that in Rasul.             I mean, you want to do that in Rasul, that's fine.            But you are appealing to a common law right that somehow found its way into our constitution without, as far as I can discern, a single case in which the writ ever to a non-citizen.               Counsel, we had 400,000 German prisoners in this country during World War II. And not a -- you say it's clear in the Vietnam example that the Chief Justice gave you, it's clear that habeas would lie.   400,000 of these people.                     It never occurred to them.               And many of them were civilians, by the way, and not in uniform.                     Not a single habeas petition filed.               He claims he wasn't assisting the German army, just as these people here claim that they were not attacking U.S. bases.              Where -- where was he held?              Are you sure he was being held in Pennsylvania?              I mean, you're being held within the jurisdiction of the United States.                 I am still waiting for a single case, other than the Indian case which you mentioned which was under a statute, a single case in which an alien that -- in a -- in a territory not within the Crown, was granted habeas corpus. And it's not enough to say there was a statute that applied on the seas.                 That's fine.   Just give me one case.    There's not a single one in all of this lengthy history.

06-1221 +++$+++               We don't really know, do we, what the district court's order was based on? Whether it was based on 401 or 403?                     Did the district court explain its order at all?              It didn't, did it?              Excuse me --              Yeah.       How do we know that's what the district court adopted?                 I have -- is it the order on 24a of the appendix to the petition?              It doesn't mention -- it doesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the district court is relying on.              We're not talking about the rule.     We're trying to find out what it was the district court did. Now, the court of appeals assumed the worst. I mean, assumed what makes the case the hardest for you, and that is the court of appeals assumed that the district court relied on 401.               Is it customary to assume the worst?              If there's any basis on which the district court's decision would have been correct, the district court's decision is upheld.              You -- you want to defend the harder ground, I understand.               But what Justice Breyer has just said is not necessarily so.               The "similarly situated" argument applies under 403 as well. If they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them, plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated, and, therefore, that it is stronger proof.               I don't see that one can tell from the district court's order whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403. And certainly, you just don't want to defend . 	 I think you're digging a hole for yourself.              Well, but here you have a company of 70,000 people.

I mean, sure.               Why is that relevant -- the same vicinity?    You're -- you're --               Opposing counsel has said they are -- they are three supervisors up.               What does the same vicinity have anything to do with this?                Well, one -- one would have some -- some tendency --                What about one instead of three?   Would that have some tendency?                   I guess it would.                Why, by the way, do you think this was excluded under -- under 401 rather than 403?                Well, then why should it be assumed it was done properly rather than improperly?              What was said in the order? I see nothing in the order that indicates it is under 401.              But --              That's very relevant to the 403 determination.              Picky, picky, picky on the trial court.    I must say.              It seems to me this order should be -- should be given -- it should be treated as if, it could be sustained, it should be sustained.              You -- you don't want that clarification to be done at the expense your client, I take it? (Laughter.)
06-1249 +++$+++               But when -- when would there be a tort remedy?       What -- what situation would you envision?                What if they found out about new information which would, if properly considered, alter what the labeling ought to be?               Would there be a tort remedy for the failure to bring that new information to the attention of --                You mean if you failed to provide the FDA the new information that you think negates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still couldn't be sued?                 What if -- what if you brought it to the FDA's attention and the FDA just hasn't acted on it?       You would be authorized to change the label on your own.                 I understand, but in the interim, you could -- could you be subject to a State tort suit for not changing the label when -- when you had the power to do so?               You can supplement only when there is new information?
06-1286 +++$+++                Well, I don't -- I don't really see that line.      I mean, let's -- let's take, you know, fixing the roof on a house that's in the trust. Aren't there distinctive trustee obligations with respect to preservation of property, just as there are with respect to preservation of financial assets?               I think that's a very hard line to draw.               I'm still --               I'm still trying to get back to my original question.            I -- I would like to know what you think is not an expense that's distinctive to -- to a trust, other than fixing the roof, because you haven't persuaded me on that.               I think fixing a roof is fixing a roof.               Anything else?               Isn't there a trustee obligation to pay all -- all expenses which if not paid will -- would cause a depletion of the assets?              Can't you say that that's a trustee response -- I mean, if the criterion is he paid this money only to discharge an obligation as a trustee, it seems to me all of his expenses are in that category, with the possible exception of the S corporations you're talking about.             Excuse me.           I am not sure what you mean by "non-grantor trusts."                   What is a "non-grantor trust"?             Every trust has a grantor, I assume.             So a "non-grantor trust" --             -- is a trust without any money.              Mr. Rubin, is it the advice that's different or is it -- is it the inquiry that's different.
06-1287 +++$+++               I suppose there are a lot of valuation cases under the Takings Clause, aren't there?              Is there a standard Federal rule for how you evaluate --              Mr. Phillips, could I come back to this question of whether or not there's going to be a uniform Federal rule or not.                When the district court makes this finding of what the true market value is that's a finding of fact, I assume.               And it would be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard by the court of appeals?               And if there were various methodologies that were possible and this was one of the ones that was ballpark at least reasonable, would the court of appeals have any basis for reversing the, how could you say it's --               I'm not sure what his question is.   I think he is talking about reviewing the district court's judgment on that basis.              Even if you don't agree with Justice Souter's test for the district court review of the State, might you agree with it as applied to the court of appeals review of the district court's job?              Well, are you going to answer my question, yes or no?             I didn't ask whether it was different.   I asked whether a reasonable basis for plain error -- for clearly erroneous review, by the court of appeals, begins with assessing whether the methodology used by the district court is reasonable.             Well, a combination of methodologies.   I'm talking about -- when I say methodology, I mean even if it uses a combination of five different ones, okay.             Is it reasonable?             How do you propose to have the court of appeals review the district court's selection of methodologies?             -- were reasonable?            Do they have to have been the very best?               Is it clearly erroneous if it may not be the very best, but it's ballpark and there is disagreement as to what the very best would be?
06-1321 +++$+++                Excuse me.      By its plain terms?               Read it to me, would you?               Is retaliation discrimination based on age?            I can see your argument that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary.                  The plain language doesn't cover it.                 But in Jackson it was in a different statute and here it's in the same statute. Surely that makes a big difference.                 I'm not familiar with that provision.    What does that provision say?             Well, no.        I mean, they're all in the same, in the same statute, and what that provision says is that just because we give certain relief in, in the portion applicable to private discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief in the section applicable to government discrimination, where it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be explicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although it's explicitly included for private discrimination.                   I think that's the only sensible way to read that provision.    It surely doesn't make two statutes out of, out of one.    It is simply one statute.             I think you're saying even if, even if that were the case, they would still urge the Court to come out the way they do.                   I don't think they're conceding that that's the case.              Where is this stuff?        Where is this text that we're talking about?              It's not in your brief. It's not in the appendix.          So I don't know what you're talking about.              Which we don't have here now.   I guess I can ask --              Well, that's sort of begging the question.        I mean, you're saying it's not true because our interpretation of Title VII is true. But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title VII.    That is, it makes more sense to say when it's retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed remedies within the agency. I mean, it doesn't answer the point that Justice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret Title VII the way we want to interpret it.                His point is:   One reason to interpret it the way you do want to interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through the agency mechanism, rather than in court.                 Excuse me.       Would you clarify your earlier statement:                These people have no remedies just for retaliation?                They do have remedies for the age discrimination, but not for retaliation?                 But they have remedies for age discrimination?             Okay.             To have a remedy.             You should have given us the statute to look at if that's the case.
06-1322 +++$+++                I don't understand that.         I mean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument. You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge has been filed. That doesn't make sense.                    I mean, it's just like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days. And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?               I mean, it just doesn't track.               So give me another one that will enable me to rule in your favor?               All right.      Now, does -- does the person who's filed a proper charge know whether notice has been given or not?            Is a copy of the notice always given to the filer.             It said it wasn't a charge, didn't it?   Didn't it say that it's not a charge?             Precharge counseling.                Doesn't that eliminate the whole purpose of the -- of the preliminary document, to weed out those charges that relate to employment in France?                It will -- it will be a charge even if it's in France?                I think that's right.            I think what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we decide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we don't decide to give notice.              Which is very nice for the EEOC, but not --                Intake questionnaire.              Excuse me.       I thought you said you were deprived of something else.                I mean, the statute provides for a conciliation process in which you can talk to the employee and say, you know, what happened?   And you may well be able to satisfy the employee with -- before -- before she lawyers up. I think it's a big disadvantage to -- to have no contact with the employee until there's a lawyer on the other side, and you can't talk to her confidentially; you can't make a conciliation notice.                   I think that's a considerable disadvantage, and it's -- it's a situation that the statute did not envision.                Well, as a practical matter, you can't conciliate after suit anyway.                 You can negotiate with the lawyer --                -- on the other side.                 Well, what is your test? When is it a charge?                 And don't tell me when notice is given.                 My goodness.           It's like saying there's no complaint until an answer is filed.                 It's just not true.             Yes, only because I'm sane. (Laughter.)             But there can't be equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge. So sooner or later -- you cannot run away from it -- you're going to have to give us a definition of what a charge is.              You're only going to give her equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a charge.    And you don't give me any -- unless you want to fall back on the manifest destiny rule or -- (Laughter.)              How do we fix it?        You haven't gotten notice, you haven't had a chance to conciliate -- how do we fix it?
06-134 +++$+++                Of course you could say the same thing if the mission here sold its property to someone and someone was claiming the right to possess the property by reason of the sale.                      And you could come up and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the, the ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.               But it would clearly come within the property right exception, wouldn't it?                     You -- you don't go one step back to look at the transaction that created the, the right in real property assuming the right in real property exists.               Let's assume that, let's assume that exception didn't exist.               And you had nothing but the real estate exception.         You would come in and say this ultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but whether there was a proper contract or not.                     And I -- frankly we wouldn't accept that.               Can't he force a sale of the property to collect the lien?               I understand that this action does not because of the sovereign immunity.                   But -- but we are talking about what the nature of a lien is.     In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a sale of the property so that he can get out the money represented by his lien?               Well, how can he commence an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the property?               You're distinguishing between rights in property and interests in property?               I would think that every right in property is an interest in property and vice versa.                 Congress didn't really say it.   I mean the committee said it to be precise.                 Good.              That's not beyond the realm of the conceivable, is it?             Why isn't buying land that you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?             So the Indian embassy could own real estate throughout New York City, which it wouldn't have to pay taxes on?               Or if it didn't, nothing could be done about it?               Why?      No.    You're saying, you're saying it's not a commercial activity.                    I mean --               It depends upon the use, and the use in this case is not -- is not the embassy itself or the residence of the ambassador.                  I mean, they could use a piece of property for anything.               But the buying and occupying of it is commercial activity.                Of course, this isn't a suit for the taxes.       I mean, we are not talking about a suit for the taxes.                We are talking about a declaration as to the interest in the land.                That's always brought up to answer the problem, well, you know -- let me give you a case in which it obviously is not a commercial activity, but it seems to me that the -- that the lien interest has to be honored.      Let's suppose that there is an American who is very friendly to and sympathetic with the Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a commercial activity, he gives them real estate in which to house the employees in -- in their mission. However, he retains an interest in that real estate.   He retains a lien on the real estate, to have money paid to him at some point.                 He is not willing to give the full amount of the property, but most of it. And he retains a lien.         Now, under your theory, that lien would not be enforceable, is that right?                Enforceable or not.              That seems very strange to me.              What property is it a right in if not the immovable property?              And it follows that immovable property and when the immovable property disappears the lien disappears.              You know, if it's blown away or flooded, it's now in the Atlantic; the lien is gone.              It doesn't have to be a right in the property.        If you look at it from the owner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's title in the property.        It affects the owner's title. Even if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the lien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner. And that's all that's required, as I read the title, in which rights in immovable property are an issue, and here the question is whether the, the mission's right to the property is, is impaired by this lien.              It affects the right to convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous right that goes along with the real estate.              What about an easement? That doesn't involve any of those things.                You can't exclude people and so forth.              You mean we'll have to start paying our taxes around the world?              Is that a real problem for us?   I don't think so.
06-1413 +++$+++               You can't have a unitary business -- a person who is a unitary business.                   I mean, a person can't be unitary with Exxon.                   I mean, when you speak of a unitary business you're talking about a corporation which, you know, is unitary with another corporation.              Once you put it into a personal taxation scheme, it seems to me the whole unitary business notion has no application at all.              Illinois or Ohio, were you talking about?
06-1431 +++$+++                Which is to say it was designed to overrule Patterson.               Not overrule.   They can't overrule it, but change the law --               -- so that Patterson would no longer be right.              I think that they would be astounded.              What change did the 1991 amendment make then?              You say it was intended to change the outcome of Patterson.               In what respect?   You say not in the respect of whether retaliation is included but in what respect then?               I don't understand you. Patterson said that post-formation actions were not covered, right?               Retaliation is one, but just one of many post-formation actions, right?               What other post-formation actions were there that --               What was the post-formation action that was in action in Patterson?               It didn't specify them.   I think your point is probably that it includes the same post-formation conduct that is prohibited at formation, which is to say discrimination on the basis of race, which is not retaliation; right?               Why did they -- why did they proceed under Title VII then?                 What -- what help --              Does -- does the person who is retaliated against, that is the person who complained and is retaliated against, have to be the person who was discriminated against?              Surely -- surely, you don't mean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to have a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination claim.              Surely it's your position that even when you have a discrimination claim, you don't have a retaliation claim.             I thought it was your position there are no retaliation claims under this statute.              Okay.             Any other advantages to 1981?   You get attorney's fees in 1981?             But you get that under Title VII?                Is there a Federal common law?    Are we sitting here trying to write a Federal common law?                So State courts can do that.     They can make it up; can't they?               Mr. Hawkins, don't we have a whole line of recent cases which say we have set our face against implying causes of action?               A whole bunch of recent cases saying we're not going to do that any more.               We used to do it, but we said we're not going to do it any more.               So why don't you invoke those?                Why do you agree with that? I don't understand why you agree with that.                Then don't say "yes."     I mean, it may well be that Congress thought our interpretation of 1981 was perfectly reasonable, or it had no idea what our interpretation of 1981 was.                But they know what they wanted to do in -- in 1991.             Okay?                That's all we know for sure.                That Congress wanted that disposition.   They weren't necessarily disapproving our prior decision.    Is there anything in the statute which said the Supreme Court made a bad decision, and we're going to fix it?             Did the committee vote on that committee report?             So how do you know if anybody in Congress thought that?             It could have been a teenager who wrote the report.              This is no longer Washington, right?              Okay.       I didn't know where he stopped and you began. (Laughter.)
06-1456 +++$+++              Were you helping him?      I thought so. (Laughter.)              You don't have any evidence like that here anyway, do we?             Do we know that this was going to "Spendy Land" where everybody has a lot of money?   Did we know that?              Does everybody have a lot of money in Mexico?     Is that --              Does the statutory purpose have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose?                     I mean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of this transportation was to give the money back to the fellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the drugs.     I assume that would be the principal purpose. But what if you know that when the -- when the provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to spend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash economy?     And let's assume that the latter is enough to satisfy the purpose requirement of this statute.                  What -- what would be the result?              If you assume a primary purpose to pay off the --               Even though that wasn't the real purpose -- I mean, the real purpose was to pay off this fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you.               But once you do pay him off, you know that the money is going to be ready spendable.             Because the police can't find it in that account even if it is still under your name.   In an account here the police would be able to find it.   In an account in the Cayman Islands, they won't be able to.     Isn't that -- isn't that transporting it in order to conceal, to conceal it?                I don't understand that, so I hope you will explain it later.                  It doesn't mean anything if it's not a detection statute.                 I forget what it was that I didn't understand. (Laughter.)              Mr. Beard, can't you give us something we can get this guy on? (Laughter.)              Can't we get him as an accessory to drug dealing or something?                 You say he has to walk?

Well, wait, wait, wait.        It didn't just say the agency may do it.                     It said the agency must do it.      I don't -- I don't consider "must" to be an empowerment.        I consider that to be a direction.               Would it be a public interest finding, a finding that because of the market manipulation by the seller that affected this very contract, the public interest demands that we not hold the --               I didn't say fraud.         I said market manipulation.              Mr. Kneedler, I'm not entirely understanding you.           Why should the fact that the seller later acquired market power have anything to do with whether the initial contract, when he did not have market power, was a fair one?                 The contracts are already down in black and white, his later acquisition of market power cannot affect --              I understand.         But later acquisition of market power would result in a cancellation of the permission for this particular firm to enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see why it would affect the past contracts.                 For example --                 For example, if the prices down the road turn out to be so high for the utility, that the utility would go out of business?               I don't understand what that statement means, anyway.               The current dysfunction carries over into -- into the future market?                  What does that mean?              Does it mean that because of the current dysfunction, you can't predict for sure what the rates are going to be down the road?                 Of course it means that.   But doesn't a dysfunction always mean that?              And isn't that why you enter into long-term contracts?              Because given the current dysfunction you have no idea what the price is going to be down the road.              May I ask, I am sure you understand that a finding that there was no manipulations that affected these contracts is not the same as a finding that there was no manipulation by these sellers in the market.              And there is no such finding that there was no manipulation?              And there is no finding that there was by these sellers.
06-1463 +++$+++               I would have thought you would -- you would say that when you have a contract which says that any disputes under this shall be arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, that that does automatically exclude a parallel proceeding.    Otherwise, provisions like that make no sense at all; they achieve nothing.             Nor do you mean that California applies even when it contradicts the express provisions of your agreement?              I mean, the specific governs of the general?               But that's not positive Federal law.   What stops him from doing it is the contractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties? The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that contractual agreement.               When we say we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract, it means we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one of us will go to court.             I used to teach contract law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate, it means you won't litigate.            And even if I didn't ever teach contract law, it would still be the law. (Laughter.)             You think Volt would have come out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the parties in this other litigation had agreed to arbitration?   You have any doubt --                Yeah.       I do, too.                Writing broadly is known as dictum, isn't it? (Laughter.)
06-1498 +++$+++                Mr. Phillips, what if the statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you can bring a State tort action when the conditions approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have not been complied with?        That's all it says.      Now, would you knowledge that that -- that that suit could be brought?              It's a duty that is defined by the FDA.    And I didn't hear your answer.                Would that suit be allowable or not?              It doesn't seem to me -- what I worry about is that if we say in this case it treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say what material should have been provided to the FDA, it seems to me the next what could be more central to the FDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the drug have indeed been observed?               That's central as well.                But one can also reason in the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know from the medical devices portion of the FDA that Congress has no objection to private tort actions that -- where the medical device manufacturer has not observed the requirements that the FDA's approval impose, right?   We know from that section that Congress has no objection to that there. You can probably guess that Congress has no objection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as the medical devices field.          And if I make that guess, what is so different about having a jury second-guess the provision of information portion?               Well, It is -- it is more of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the Federal Government, which is what was at issue in Buckman.    The very cause of action was providing false information to the FDA.         Here the cause of action is a standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective product.                What about the defense itself, which says that the defense is available if not only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the control of the manufacturer?                Is it wrong to say that that's -- you know, that that's interfering with the FDA's bailiwick?                Are you going to let a jury decide that?             Uh-huh.                 It was decided by the Sixth Circuit, wasn't it?             Well, unless they choose not to change their mind.           I mean, they did say that they're bound by this by Garcia as to questions of State law.             They said that bound by Garcia as to questions of State law.
06-1505 +++$+++               I suppose you could appeal to the maxim noscitur ex sociis, couldn't you --              -- and say if it's in with two other chickens, it's probably a chicken?
06-1509 +++$+++              For which purpose you'd include the receipts?             For which purpose you would include the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend instead of putting them in the corporate treasury?                I'm less concerned with the word "distribution" in the statute than I am with the phrase "with respect to its stock" -- "distribution made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock." Now, the court below held that there had to be a conscious intent to return capital.                   Even if I disagree with that and think that that was wrong, isn't the Government right that it nonetheless is the burden to establish that the distribution here was a distribution with respect to stock, and the distribution was given to the girlfriend who owns no stock in the corporation.   How does it become a distribution with respect to stock?              Or girlfriends.           I mean, why doesn't it distinguish a girlfriend as much as it distinguishes an employee who's receiving back a loan?              And the Government would say yes?              Yes, they're really -- they're really between a rock and a hard place on this stuff.              You are pretty sure they won't.              Even so, no harm no foul, if, in fact, you hadn't proffered any evidence that would enable you to meet the -- in respect to stock requirement.     Now, what do you say to the contention that you hadn't proffered anything?                 Well, wait.      Doesn't he have to show, still show, that it's with respect to stock?                 That one little element That he has to show the distribution was not because this was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to stock, and the record is -- is that the intent?                The issue is whether the Government wants to convict more -- more malfeasors or whether it wants to collect more money, and the latter obviously prevails in the cases, right?
06-157 +++$+++                If I understand your position correctly, if Congress enacts a program that favors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly what the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but if Congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and the President implements it in a fashion that favors religion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned.              Is that an accurate description?                  Why not?                  Okay.              So you're saying if the Government, the executive, or the Congress, if the congressional statute authorizes the giving of money for the billing of a church, that's bad; but if it authorizes -- it makes a general authorization to the President -- no.   If the congressional statute says the Government will build a church, that's okay, because then the money doesn't go outside the Government?              Well, as far as standing is concerned.              What is your answer to that?   That in fact it's bad in the first situation and okay in the second, as far as standing is concerned?              There is no standing for the internal Government church?                 No, we're not forcing anybody in at gunpoint.          We're just building a Government church.                 But we're talking taxpayer standing.   And you think there is a real difference insofar as whether the taxpayer is harmed between the Congress saying we're going to give the money to a religious organization to build a church and Congress saying we're going to build a church.                     You really think there's a difference?               In both cases money is being used for a purpose that is contrary to the establishment clause, according to the taxpayer.               I don't care whether it's the least of the concerns, it's a concern.             It's the same establishment clause concern in both cases.             Now you may well be correct that there's a freedom of religion clause violation in one case and not in the other, but as far as the establishment clause violation, I find it difficult to understand the difference between the two.                 But not -- but not if the President just gives the money out of a general appropriation, authorizing him to give money to people who are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based Initiative was -- was designed to help?                 If the President hands over the money, that's okay?                 Why, why not necessarily? I thought that was your -- you proposition, that it has to be a congressional violation not an executive.                 He's getting the money from Congress under a general, under a general appropriation. If he takes this money and he says here, use it for a religious purpose, that's okay?              As far as standing is concerned, he can't be sued?              I -- I've been trying to make sense out of what you're saying. (Laughter.)              Or to, or to put it another way, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every Executive action that involves the expenditure of congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied challenge to an expenditure statute.                      Because the only way the statute is applied is through executive action. And whenever the executive spends the funds improperly, you have an as-applied challenge to the congressional statute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general statute or a -- or a single shot statute.              It's a --              That's the essence of an as-applied challenge.        You say the statute's okay.             It is just what is being done under this statute that is bad.   You don't have to identify a bad statute.                  You're saying it is a perfectly good statute, but the President is -- is violating the Constitution in the way that he's applying it.              Getting upset is a constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit?             If people get upset about spending money for purposes that the Federal Government is not allowed to spend money for because of States' rights, that also would justify Article III standing, wouldn't it?
06-1595 +++$+++               So a co-worker of your client says:    You know, the boss really was guilty of sexual harassment and the co-worker says:                  Gee, that's terrible.              That's enough?       That's opposition?              What about, violating the law is terrible?              Okay.      But if she said that in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark was "Violating the law is terrible," that's opposition?              But that doesn't solve the problem of having too broad an entry into this thing. You get to the jury by just showing that she said "Oh, if he did that, it's terrible," and then it's up to the jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the employer fired this person or not.                  I mean, that just leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems to me.              And there does not have to have been sexual harassment in the employment unit.              So this is a law directed against expressive activity.              Are those laws good?           I thought we had a First Amendment.              It wouldn't be fine with me.              What if -- what if I am indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment?                      I am a world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar, and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer in connection with this internal investigation and asked whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker.                   And I'd say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing too. Is that expressing opposition?              Covered by the participation clause?              Well, since this is a case where the --             You think the language "investigation under this title" is the equivalent of "investigation with respect to an alleged offense under this title"?    That doesn't strike me as self-evident at all.   It seems to me "investigation under this title" to me means an investigation under this title, which is not an investigation by the employer.
06-1646 +++$+++                Mr. Shanmugam, what is the government's position as to a person who is not a repeat offender?    He commits the crime for the first-time.               Now the government says there are alternative maximums and you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher.                  Why wouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits the crime the first-time?               You're adding something to the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in this field we look to the elements of the crime.               And as far as the elements are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a repeat offender.               Well, there was also the statute involved in the LaBonte case, where -- where the statute said the Sentencing Commission "shall assure that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants who have certain types of prior convictions."               And that did focus on the -- on the nature of the defendant and not on the element of the crime.               So it would be easy, of course, if recidivism were an element of the crime --               -- for a crime which includes the act plus the recidivism?              Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't understand what you said about Congress's intent with regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA.              You're saying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines, but simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within which the guidelines were applicable?                Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain to me again why -- why you treat the enhancement in a State guideline system differently?             It seems to me that if you get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing as if you get an enhancement because you're a recidivist.    What's the difference?             You don't think "ringleader" is a broad tier.              Well, some of them have simply said, we're going to let the jury decide.                       We're going to let the jury make these determinations that Apprendi says have to be made by the jury.                      But they're still -- they're still referred to as sentencing factors.               Well, that's the question in the case.               That's good or bad, depending upon whether -- whether your interpretation of the statute is right or the other side's.               It's good to put more people in jail?   I mean, that isn't necessarily what we're after.   We're --
06-1666 +++$+++               A lynch mob doesn't require investigation by American courts of the internal workings of a foreign government.              No, but I think it would be quite extraordinary to investigate the Government of Iraq.   That's a matter that the executive can take into account.              But It would be a strange thing for an American court to do.              Do you think an eight-hour lead is enough?   I don't know.              It would make a good movie.
06-1717 +++$+++                Excuse me.      The paralegals' rates would also be subject to the -- to the cap.               They couldn't go above the cap.               Okay.               Indeed, would insist.               Right.               Well, agent fees --               I mean, the problem exists whether or not you make paralegal fees attorney's fees, because agent fees are also subject to the same cap.               And agents were paid a good deal less than that.                This problem is going to exist anyway, isn't it?         I mean, even if you don't cram paralegals into the other expenses, there are going to be other expenses that are in the other expenses.                You're going to have to have this same problem -- and what about the overhead and so forth?               Am I to understand, you claim that even if they are expenses, they should -- they should be paid for at market rate, don't you?                Of course, that's no loss to the government because when you put it into the lawyer's rate, you hit the ceiling for the lawyer's rate that much sooner.                It seems like that would be --                Right.
06-179 +++$+++                What if the manufacturer wants to make what you call an improvement?                    Can it simply market the product with that improvement without further FDA action?               Even if it is designed to improve safety and effectiveness?                Right, but those devices had not been -- they were just grandfathered.                  They had not been specifically approved as safe and effective by the FDA.     Right?                 What was the State requirement there?      I mean, what was the Federal requirement there?      It was simply that the device had been on the market before the law became effective. Right?               Yeah.               Well, but the point is that the -- to follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, the point is that the FDA in Lohr had never made a determination of weighing the risks against the benefits, as they do for the issuance of PMA's.                   And so the jury was not replowing the same ground that the FDA had already plowed in Lohr.               Does that mean that, under the Food and Drug regulation, the States can issue their own regulations that contradict the Federal approval?               No.     No.      I'm talking about drugs.   Not medical devices.            You say that --               Well, no.        I mean, you can comply with both.    It's just additional -- you have to go further to comply with the State rule, so there's no conflict.   It's easy to --               Then the States can issue regulations that go beyond -- beyond what the FDA says in drug matters?    I would be surprised if that's the case.              And is that the only basis here?    Conflict -- there's no conflict?                 It's all okay under the Medical Devices Act?              They can add additional requirements so long as -- and I suppose they can do this by regulation -- so long as these additional requirement dos not prevent complying with the Federal requirements?    So long as there's no conflict, the States can add additional requirements under the Medical Devices Act?    That's not my understanding of it.              It is field preemption, isn't it?               If it --               Well, that's not the way I would -- the jury has to say that? I mean, in fact --               In fact, that's what's going on, but it could have been safe if -- if they had made the change that the FDA rejected.                  But the case goes to the jury and that's, in fact, what's going on.               The trial is, you know, had he -- had he made this change, it would have been safe, but he didn't make the change and, therefore, you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, should hold the company liable.              So it just --              It just has to be the theory of the case.     We have to look at each jury verdict and decide whether that was the basis on which the jury made the decision.              That's under State law, but you -- you don't say that Federal preemption requires that; you say that by the grace of New York State, that may be the situation, but New York State can change that law, as far as you're concerned, right?              New York State can let it go to the jury, despite -- despite what the FDA has done.    You've said that it's simply a defense under New York State law and the law of most States.                But it doesn't have to be a defense under New York State law.              I thought that's the point Justice Ginsburg was implying.              Of course, this is all a little unrealistic.     It is not as though some expert agency of the State has conducted a very scientific inquiry and decided that there's something safer than what the FDA approved or that it's negligent to issue what the FDA approved. What's going on is simply one jury has decided that in its judgment, there was a safer device that should have been used; and because of the judgment of that one jury, the manufacturer is placed at risk in selling a device that scientists at the FDA have said is okay. I find that extraordinary.
06-219 +++$+++                 Mr. Garre, could you crank up the thing?   The sound isn't working, I don't think, Mr. Garre.                  They may be wrong, too. They may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as the officers who conducted it.                And there are indeed those in the West who think that the BLM does, does act quite arbitrarily and high-handedly and is, is upheld by, by the, the administrative courts.                   Now, if that's a problem, what's the solution to that problem?              That's one by one.         Every time there is another trespass he has to go all the way through the administrative procedure and then when the, when the administrative court says, well, it was okay, then he has to go through the regular Federal courts. That doesn't seem to me like a realistic remedy, not for somebody who claims he's being systematically harassed for five years as, as is the claim here.              I don't assume that at all. Even if they, even if they succeed, they say, yes, you're right, they trespassed, good for you.                     I mean, what is the remedy if they did trespass?                  What administrative remedy does he obtain.                  What -- the photographing of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and they pay him for that.         And then he claims that the BLM follows them just to harass them, just taking photographs.   What relief could he get for that?                  Let's assume they wasn't trespassing.              What damages would you get for the trespass of a -- one, one BLM agent on your land?   A lot of money you're going to get for that? Would it, would it come anywhere close to reimbursing you for the lawyers' fees that it's taken to go, to go all the way through the litigation?              He doesn't say it deprived him of his property which is his business.              He is saying it's a trespass; get off my land.              Part of his claim is -- is selective enforcement.        You know, maybe he did trespass, maybe some of his cattle did stray on somebody's land. But they are beating on him because of what they say is his failure to give a reciprocal easement which the Government is entitled to. To what extent was any of the administrative approval of the BLM agents' actions, to what extent was that based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this reciprocal easement from him?              Because I don't see that it's legitimate at all.                Was that because the Government was entitled to the reciprocal easement?             Is that why they said that?                It wasn't extortion because he should have given the easement.                Not after, not after they have already given away -- I mean, yes; they could come to him anew and say I'll tell you what, if you give us this easement we'll give you yet another one.             But he had one in, from the past, which -- which his predecessor had given a reciprocal easement for, and the Government failed to record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it.             And they're mad at him for not giving back that easement which they failed to record.             It wouldn't be reciprocal. What was the Government offering to give him in exchange for his, his reaffirming the prior easement that they had failed to record?      What was the Government giving him in exchange?                 He had that already.                 I did not -- I did not understand that.             If a -- including, you know, busting into his lodge and disrupting the furniture and all of that, they thought that that was probably --             -- probably allowed?              Is that a test for -- for -- for qualified immunity?         You have to know -- not only --              It's not enough to know that your action was wrongful?             You have to know the particular statute or constitutional provision under which a remedy would be sought?             They might have been lying about that --             -- just as they lied about a lot of other stuff, according to --             Why wouldn't there be an assignment?    Why, why would the prior owner have any -- any interest in not assigning it?
06-278 +++$+++                So you want to get away from a hypothetical then.          I don't know why you try to defend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says amend the marijuana laws.          That's not this case as you see it, is it?               This banner was interpreted as meaning smoke pot, no?               Why do we have to get into the question of what the school board's policy is and what things they can make its policy?                   Surely it can be the -- it must be the policy of any school to discourage breaking of the law.      I mean, suppose this banner had said kill somebody, and there was no explicit regulation of the school that said you should not, you should not foster murder.   Wouldn't that be suppressible?               Of course it would, so --               Why can't we decide this case on that narrow enough ground, that any school whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress speech that advocates violation of the law?              Does it have --             Mr. Starr, you -- you responded to Justice Breyer that you think the school could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on a trip.   Could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands on a trip?             And if not -- if not, what's the difference?              Were they required to go to this event and could they have skipped off and gone home without violating --              They were required to attend.
06-313 +++$+++                  Wait.      Why is it improper for, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts of this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack of mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of the jury is the death penalty?                That's an improper argument?   Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty to come back with the death penalty?                      Why can't the prosecution argue that?              I don't understand your concession.    Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with a death verdict.    Surely, although he didn't explicitly mention the evidence, the underlying premise of his argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad, you have to do your duty.           Nobody likes to kill, but just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's their duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that the evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty that the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring the death verdict.      I don't see anything wrong with that.             Who said he was not supposed to do these things?             And is that the law here?              It says that in the text, doesn't it, "clearly established by the Supreme Court"? Is that not in the text of the statute?               Certainly didn't say it in the brief in opposition.           And we might not well have taken the case had that point been raised in the BIL.             You have a much more limited point, as I understand it.                 Your more limited point is simply that this is not clearly established law pronounced by the Supreme Court.             In this area of constitutional violation.             You can't have it both ways, counsel.   I mean, you're really losing me here. Either it is our supervisory power and therefore the States don't have to follow it, or it is more than our supervisory power and the States do have to follow it. I don't know that there's any way to straddle that.
06-340 +++$+++                Except to the extent that a project may be endangering a species, not by reason of change in water quality but, for example, by destroying habitat, constructing a dam or that sort of thing.             Mr. Kneedler, I hate to eat up any of your rebuttal time, but would you state briefly what -- how you would treat these other matters that were resolved by the agency and that were not mandatory, its decision to transfer prior certificate authority to the States, for example, and the other instance raised by opposing counsel?                     What if I agree with you on whether you can deny the NPDES permit, but I'm concerned about these other actions by the agency that were discretionary?               Should we remand?              Do you mean the executive can ignore earmarks?
06-376 +++$+++                Where is (e)(2)?   Is it produced in these materials.              I got (e)(1); I don't have (e)(2).    I don't really like talking about a section I don't have in front of me.               Ah.               That's one thing about this case I'm sure about. (Laughter.)                 That's right.               It's easy to see why the only cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1). (E)(2) which we don't have in the materials, but I have gotten a copy of it. And (e)(1) says that the Secretary "may" abate the assessment of all or any part.                 And those cases that denied it said this is discretionary; he doesn't have to.   (E)(2) on the other hand, interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check, says the Secretary "shall" abate the assessment.                 So really, (e)(2) doesn't -- doesn't do you any good at all with respect to whether there was a cause of action before (h) was adopted.             I see.           What you're say is that cases that used to be bringable under (e)(2) would now be bringable only under (h) which would in effect be an implicit repeal of (e)(2).             At least as far as suits elsewhere than in the tax court.              Mr. -- Mr. Redding, let me come back to the phantom (e)(2) which we have finally traced down.              I am not sure that (h) would impliedly repeal (e)(2), because (e)(2) is mandatory.     There isn't any question under (e)(2) whether there has been an abuse of discretion.              There is no discretion.    It is mandatory to the extent that the Administrative Procedure Act would govern (e)(2), it would be for a violation of law not for abuse of discretion. So when (h) says the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine whether the Secretary's failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, I would take that to apply only to (e)(1), which says the Secretary may abate and not to (e)(2) which says the Secretary shall abate.         There is no question of -- of discretion in (e)(2) at all.              It was a pretty good argument, I thought. (Laughter.)             What about those other sections, (c) and (d), which say the Secretary is authorized?    Have there been cases which, which said that you could sue for, for his failure to make use of that?             It's the same as with (e)?             As with (e)(1).             Who said that?
06-413 +++$+++                Did he say, "for example," with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg mentioned?     I didn't recall that he said for example.               Well, aren't we obliged under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable conclusion from the facts?               So even if it is just a conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a totally unreasonable conclusion, right?               Of course there is on demeanor.   I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not the case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to show that demeanor did not make the difference?               It's the burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable determination.               And secondly, he could present such evidence if he showed that there was absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference. But in a case where the statements are seemingly contradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is very relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of the Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made the difference. And besides which, wasn't there some part of the record that you referred to where he said "and I believe him"?
06-427 +++$+++ 
06-43 +++$+++        Mr. Grossman, is there any reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)?       I mean, we, we created this, this cause of action.       It's not set forth in the statute, although other private causes of action are. If it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly limit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked by the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for private attorney general's actions?       You need actual conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party. Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?       Intended or known?    I mean, I don't see -- what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to defraud the shareholders?     Is it enough that they just knew it would be used for that purpose?       Well, when you say "in furtherance of," you -- you import intent.     They didn't care what Charter was going to do with it, but they pretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was to make its books look better. Would that be enough?       That's what I thought your position was.       So it's not an intent necessarily.     It's just knowledge.       Sure.   After trial -- you know, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was going to be used for that purpose.         I mean, that's what this is all about, isn't it, getting it -- getting it by the summary-judgment stage?       What facts -- what has to be alleged short of -- on information and belief the defendant knew that -- that this information would appear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the status of the stock?       But that's exactly the thing they told them to separate.       What other reason?       I understand what you're saying.    It seems to me that when you say that they can't be connected, you're saying precisely, you can't be bartering the advertising revenue for the increased money that you're paying.       But don't aiders and abettors have to have that purpose as well?      What distinguishes -- what distinguishes the liability that you propose from aider and abettor liability?       So any aiding-and-abetting through a deceptive act makes you a principal?         Is that it?   You can't be an aider and abettor by committing or enabling a deceptive act without becoming a principal?       You cannot?       Yes.       Yes, but -- but if you do, or if you should have known, you are not an aider and abettor.   You are automatically a principal.       Is it fair to say that all aiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are principals?       What's the difference? What separates the two?       Don't you need that to be an aider or abettor?       If I'm entirely innocent, and I don't --       You see, I really thought the difference was that the principal is the one who makes the deceptive representation and obtains money from it.   The aider and abettor is the person who facilitates or enables that deceptive representation, which is what we have here.       And you say if you facilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly negligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but you're a principal.   I really don't understand what's the line between the two.
06-457 +++$+++              Why does the Post Office have immunity from Maine laws?              Really?                You could kill people and all sorts of stuff.      I mean -- (Laughter.)               But why aren't you just driving all this business to the Postal Service?                  I mean, you know, what have you accomplished?                  You'd drive FedEx out of business if they choose not to incur the additional expense.      And so, you know, all these people just ship it through the Postal Service.               You can't do it.       I mean, they're exempt from Maine laws.               Didn't you know that? (Laughter.)               Well, they --               Yes, but I think that the reason they make that concession is that they say you must prove knowledge, and they're -- they're not concerned about the -- about intentionally transgressing Maine's law.   What they're concerned about is the additional steps that you require them to go through to make sure that there is no tobacco. So they're not really worried about it so long as you have a knowledge requirement.               And that's why they're not worried about it, because it's hard to prove.                Well, maybe because Congress wanted the regulatory void.                     Maybe Congress didn't want these things to be enforced by regulating the transporter, as opposed to regulating the shipper and the receiver. As far as the game regulation is concerned, isn't it the case that UPS won't carry any game now because of the -- because of your game regulations?               It's too onerous.               So you've sort of driven them out of the business.              Well, as long as the buyer is not an interstate carrier, there is really no -- no problem of conflicting with Federal law.              Times 50.              Times 50, because 49 other States would have different requirements, and all those requirements might -- might cost only a penny to comply with.    But you add them all up, and it is half a buck.             Mr. Stern, I'd be interested in whether you have any response to the Government's point that, at least as far as 1555-D is concerned, that is a direct regulation of -- of the -- the shipper -- not the shipper, of the transporter.                     So that -- so that your point that this is not a regulation of -- of transport is simply -- is simply wrong as far as 1555-D is concerned.        Do you acknowledge that?             Okay.
06-480 +++$+++              If -- if, if indeed that's, that's what he's aiming at, low price.                 Is it the object of the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to produce low prices?              I thought it was consumer welfare.              And I thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.              So the mere fact that it would increase prices doesn't prove anything.                It doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare.                 If, in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive products at a lower price, wouldn't it?              So I don't know why, why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether it's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not. The market out there has different goods at different prices which have different qualities that attract different consumers.
06-484 +++$+++                In a criminal case, the person seeking that action is a government officer who presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives, whereas we're talking about private suits and some private litigants are selfish.              Yeah.       Well, I don't think Congress was trying to achieve an alteration in the ultimate standard, either, in the jury standard.                   What it was concerned with is the enormous expense of -- of discovery.     And, and tried to set a high wall to get to the discovery stage.        I don't know why that should have to affect or should logically affect the standard that the jury is told to use.              How about just saying that he knew it?              Just saying that he knew it.   Without saying why they knew that he knew it? You're saying they have to give a reason why they knew that he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports? Suppose they didn't say that.               They just said knowing that the -- that the figures were otherwise, he -- he set them forth.                 Mr. Shanmugam, could -- could I get you back to -- to your, your assertion of we don't have to reach in this case the question of whether the same standard applies at trial as, as at the pleading stage? It seems to me a Seventh Amendment claim has been raised.   It's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication.              If indeed the two standards are the same, there's certainly no Seventh Amendment problem.      So why don't we have to first of all decide, in resolving the Seventh Amendment claim, whether the two standards are the same?                 But you're getting to the merits of the constitutional problem.                     And we usually run away from constitutional problems.                     We don't even want to consider the merits of it.                   And we don't have to, if indeed the two standards are the same.
06-5247 +++$+++                Well, if we're talking about what -- where is the logic in the result that I believe you're position produces, which is that a prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless, obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the error actually prejudiced him.              Whereas if the State court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred on -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred, whether there was any constitutional violation, then he would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable probability of harm. Now, you know, why would there -- what does he care whether -- whether the error below consisted in an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous determination that there was no violation?                     Why should there be a different standard of review between the two?               Let's assume another violation, the court erroneously determines -- erroneously -- that there was no constitutional violation at all.     Its error is not with regard to the harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a constitutional violation.           Why should there be one standard of review for one error and a different standard of review for the other, regardless of whether the State court conducted Chapman or not?                You could say the same thing when the State court has erroneously determined that there was no violation. In that case, you apply the Kotteakos standard.   I just don't understand the rationale of applying a higher standard to the other error.               And it is that determination that you are objecting to here.                  The harmlessness determination.              But for the former, you are perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos.                  And for the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman. I just don't see the logic of that.             The dissenters certainly thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in Brecht.   They said that Kotteakos would apply even where the State court has found that "no violation has occurred."             In other words, never approached the harmlessness thing.                 That's what the dissenters thought.              The trouble with reading that second question that way is that, you know, it follows from your first question, which speaks in the generality of cases.       It's not speaking to this case. Your first question presented is, if constitutional error in a State trial is not recognized by the judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set forth in Chapman or in Brecht?               That's the first question.    Very generalized. Second question:            Does it matter which harmless-error standard is employed?                     I didn't take that to mean does it matter in this case which of the two.                       I thought it meant, you know, is there any difference between the two standards?           Don't you think that's fair reading of it.              You think it means, does it matter in this case which harmless -- you think that second sentence means would, would the defendant be entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which harmless error standard is employed?                    You think that's what it means?
06-5306 +++$+++                Mr. Mancino, your position here is that this rule is not jurisdictional. Now, what -- what are the consequences of that?   I take it that that would mean that the court of appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether the matter has been filed too late?               Right?          If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can -- can take a late, a late filing?               No, no, but I'm asking whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that? If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?              And you need an objection or else it's, it will be okay?              And you need an objection or else it will be all right?              -- the other, the other side would say sure, take 20 days.                  Okay?   So you prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs off on it, gives you 20 days.              That's okay then, right?              Because the other side's agreed.   He won't object on the court of appeals.                   And suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the rule says 14.               You know sometimes, sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case that they -- that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.               And sometimes in reliance on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no jurisdiction here; too bad.               Even though the court said it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the district judge.     District judges make mistakes.               It's even worse, it seems to me.   I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial and so forth.               But if it's jurisdictional, we have to say, you know, too bad.                   Yes, you were misled by the judge.     In reliance on the district judge, you expended a lot of time and money, but there was no jurisdiction.     And that's the end of the matter.               Maybe Arabic numerals aren't jurisdictional either.
06-531 +++$+++                 Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious to get your reaction to one of the points made by opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort of two different pieces of litigation at issue here, that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the final decision was a facial challenge.                   Is there anything to that?               It is not a determination, is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?               It is just a determination that we don't know at this point enough to say that you don't have a right.              Well, I mean, what if -- what if there's nothing else he can do?                     What -- what horrible does he face?        He faces a horrible of having to pay for his own litigation, just like the rest of us do. I mean this is an extraordinary benefit we're talking about here, getting -- getting your attorney's fees paid.       I -- it doesn't seem to me that we're casting this, this person into the underworld.                Excuse me.       How can that be, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive question of law?    Does that happen?             But it wasn't the issuance of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was the appeal to this Court where we -- we resolved a question of law.                 The point is you wouldn't mind putting that on a resume, that you have been subjected to a preliminary injunction.              It's not a black mark on your name, is it?              You haven't violated any Federal law.              They are voluntary, these settlements, aren't they?           So you could at least say that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's fees for settling gets what he asked for, right?             It's voluntary.              That may be, but that's not the way the statute is written.
06-5618 +++$+++               In any case, you -- you, you are not driven to the alternative that Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve absolute uniformity.        It's very easy.               It was what the dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is use facts found by the jury and you can have the sentences as rigid as you like. It is really only, only when you want to let the facts be found by the judge that you come into the difficulty that, that we're arguing about.                     But it's certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there is no way to achieve determinate sentencing.                There certainly is.                You don't -- you don't have to engage in our dispute here. (Laughter.)
06-562 +++$+++                But you have to pay the costs.   I mean, isn't that something of a disincentive? Before you can sue?               Yes.      It would be one thing if you skip away from a settlement without having to pay any money.   But in order to come under, under 9607, they have to, they have to shell out the money.              But even if there wasn't, you wouldn't have your principal argument, which is, you know, which is that the reason not to interpret 107 the way your friends on the other side want is that you're going to destroy the settlement provision of 113, which didn't use to exist.     What argument would you make for having us read the word "other" in the what seems to me strange way you want?              You're missing my point. My point is the settlement bar didn't used to exist.                    So previously, whether the cases were split or not, there was -- your best argument for the proposition that 107(a) does not permit suit did not exist.              Assume it didn't exist. Assume that body of law didn't exist.                  But what would you have argued when somebody came in and said 107, this provision, includes PRPs?         You may have argued -- your best argument would not have been available.
06-571 +++$+++                 Excuse me.       It wasn't contested in Smith?             Excuse me.       Go back over that.             Why couldn't it have been said in Smith that -- that trading it for drugs was not the only way in which the offense could have been committed?   Couldn't the same thing have been said in Smith?             So the issue in Smith was weapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're arguing here?             The issue here is use versus nonuse, active employment versus passive receipt?              I think you are making his argument.   I think you're -- you're too humble, the argument you're making.             And, of course, you could say the same thing about Bailey, I suppose.               You know, What was there in Bailey except -- what was the term, linguistic -- nothing but a linguistic decision.             Bailey doesn't make any more sense either from a policy standpoint.             We sometimes we rely on linguistics, don't we?             And sometimes the words of the statute.
06-5754 +++$+++                How do you reconcile the language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall state the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the guidelines? Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy between giving reasons and giving the specific reason. Where does that line fall in your estimation?               You haven't answered my question.   I mean, you explain why it's put in there, but I want to know what is the difference between giving the reasons and giving the specific reason.              Mr. Cochran, I have this concern:     If we accept your submission that the district court should just consider the guidelines together with everything else, give them a presumption of validity, anything else, just something to consider, that would presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with the district court's findings of fact. But the district court's sentence is going to go on appeal.    And the appellate court in reviewing it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the record, military service, you know, which we think should have been taken into account.                      And, therefore, we set it aside. Now, the next case that comes up, which doesn't have the element of military service, in all other respects the same as your client's case, it comes up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here and therefore we affirm the sentence. Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the district court's determination?                He would not get that sentence but for this fact.                So you haven't shown us a way out of the problem.                No, even if you don't -- don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline, you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review, guidelines or not. If the -- if the appellate court says, oh, given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is made a necessary condition for giving the higher sentence. So you haven't -- you haven't solved the problem of the, of the apparent conflict between -- between Booker and the advisory guidelines.               You're not focusing on my point.   I concede that the district court is free as a bird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review. And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness is going to make a particular fact determinative of whether this sentence can stand or not.                  Isn't that right?               And that's going to be a problem.             Well, it did incorporate them in that district judges were free to depart from the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one of these human factors not considered by the guidelines which existed in the particular case.              Well, if they were systematically removed then all of these other human factors that you're complaining about were considered by the guideline commission and were simply rejected.
06-593 +++$+++                What is a footman?               Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).               Page 77a as you said. But what is your argument there?                     I mean, that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision that you say we should ignore or at least should accept the Secretary's reinterpretation of.                That's right.                Yeah.       I see.   Is that clear in the -- in the specific Senate report that is referred to here?                This, the one that's cited in the regulation itself.            Because I -- otherwise, I don't, I ignore those things.               That's cited in the regulation.    Does that report say it?             Well, wait.      Does the notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's position?                 I didn't think it did. They're just floating an idea.                You know --                 Run it up the flagpole, see if --
06-618 +++$+++                  Which is what the statute says, and so how could the statute possibly be unconstitutional?                 I mean, the Constitution -- I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate Clause exception.     Now, I guess you can argue that a lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional requirement that, that the constitutionality of the statute be called into question.                Well, that doesn't comply with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court from "any interlocutory or final judgment decree of order of court upon the constitutionality of any provision of the Act."             Now, and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the constitutionality of the provision.              My problem is, it's extraordinary.     We have very few direct appeal cases any more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing a decision by a court that a particular use of this statute was unconstitutional.               You say it was, the statute was unconstitutional as applied.                       That's sloppy language.   It really means that this application of the statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was unconstitutional. I think that's something different from saying that it was an order of the court upon the constitutionality of any provision.                       Which provision of this Act has been held to be unconstitutional?              Which -- but it hasn't been held to be unconstitutional.              It's perfectly constitutional.     You're just saying it can't be used in this particular case.              I mean, read the language. It says "The constitutionality of any provision of this act," not "the constitutionality of the application of any provision of this act."              What -- what had the lower court held?     It isn't a question of what we held; it's a question of what the lower court had held.                 Had the lower court held that it was unconstitutional?              I mean, but that can mean -- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by just saying we don't have to reach the facial question; we can decide it on an as applied question.                 But in order to get here in the first place, it has to be a challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the Act.              Well, he didn't do exclusively that stuff anyway.               We can certainly all agree on that.    And why isn't it sufficient that when any of those issues are, his activities in any of those capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence, anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in your Speech or Debate Clause objection?              Why is the whole suit precluded?               I think you have to figure out when he was hired.             There's never an office.      I mean, I think the office is just a fictional construct anyway.   So what you say now has nothing to do with whether, whether this current Senator has, has departed from the scene.     Even if he were still on the scene, there still wouldn't be any such thing as that office. It's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit against Congress, and so you say none of these suits can ever be brought.               Why isn't it a waiver of sovereign immunity when you set up a suit that envisions a suit which will be paid off by the Senate?              Why isn't that a waiver of sovereign immunity?               A physical, a physical office, yes.     I mean, they didn't work in the hallway. But their staff salary was not paid out of their, quote, "office."    It was paid out of the Senate.               Setting it is quite different from paying it.               Right.           The Senate puts a limit on how much money it will spend for a particular Senator.    That's all that amounts to.                    It doesn't hand him the money.    It's still the Senate's money, isn't it? And what the Senate says is each office will have so much of a call upon our fund and no more.
06-6330 +++$+++                  Maybe that was wrong. Maybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to be faithful to the Congressional determination, should have done it quite proportionately.                      I mean, I'm not hung up on what the Sentencing Commission said.                      I'm hung up on what the courts should do now.             Indeed, it may be quite impossible to achieve uniformity through advisory guidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory. (Laughter.)              And you don't say -- you don't say anything goes.           I mean, the hypothetical that Justice Alito gave is -- is easy, only because Congress has created the 100 to 1 ratio as presumably reasonable. If Congress enacted it as a statute, it has to be reasonable. So that enables you to say anything from 1 to 1 to 100 to 1 is reasonable.                But your position is not anything goes.      It's anything that's reasonable goes.                Only because Congress has said 100 to 1.   That strikes me as utterly unreasonable. But if Congress has said it, it can't be unreasonable. That's what makes that an easy hypothetical, but that would not be the normal case, that a 100 to 1 disparity wouldn't be -- would not be unreasonable.
06-637 +++$+++               You've added something to the question, though, didn't you?              Attending public school and receiving --              I thought it wasn't that. I thought it was simply Congress figured that there are probably a lot of people in New York City, in Manhattan in particular, who are going to send their kids to private school, no matter what, and they can get special services in private school, but what the heck, if we can get $30,000 from the city to pay for it, that's fine. In other words, this was meant to be an option for people who wanted to go to the public schools but couldn't go to the public schools because they couldn't get the private services there, but it was never meant to be an option for people who had no desire to go to public schools at all anyway, and --             -- and without this condition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was never in the public school, was he?             Yes, but that is -- but the parent would not have to show that the parent would have used that available public remedy --             --    if it were there?             Of course, to be fair, this provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a private school.   It also applies to somebody who is already in public school, and the program offered by the -- by the city is patently inadequate.                  You are compelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a program that anybody would see will -- will not meet the needs.              The parent would presumably cover themselves, look it, he's getting X,Y -- X, Y, and Z in the private school and you're going to give him Z; Z is not going to be enough.            And the burden on you would be upon you to say, oh, we think Z is enough.
06-6407 +++$+++                Wait.      I didn't understand that to be what the case said.             I thought that the case held that it wasn't successive there because the claim had, in fact, been brought in the first petition, and that first petition was dismissed as premature.                And the argument was made that this is just a continuation of that first petition. Now, the difference here is that the claim was not brought in the first petition, even though it was pretty clear after that case of ours that you had a sure route to raising the claim if you raised it prematurely, and then brought the petition later.                  The difference is that in Martinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this was not a second petition.            Now you may be quite right, that there is good reason to say you shouldn't bring something that isn't ripe.            But in that earlier case, we were able to get around the language of the statute which says a second or successive petition is not permissible. Here, how do you get around the language other than to say it shouldn't be that way, that you should be able to bring a second or successive petition when you're raising an issue that was not ripe at the time of the first petition? I mean, as a policy matter, that's a very good argument.     But what do you do with the language in the statute?     And after all, Congress is entitled to say -- to place limits upon our ability to review State court judgments.                 It doesn't say a second run at the same claim.      It says a second petition.                 Even if you bring new petitions in your second claim that weren't raised in your first, it's still a second or successive petition, and I find it hard to get over that language.             Before we get too far into the merits --             -- I, I'm not done about the jurisdiction yet.     I wanted to ask you about the statement you made in response to a question; you said it's not successive and it isn't a second petition if the first one could not have been brought.                Right?   If the first one was unripe? But we've just decided this term that that's not the rule.     In Burden, we -- we -- we said that even though a first, an earlier petition was unripe, the second petition was still a second petition.                So that can't be the principle that you're espousing, unless you want us to overrule Burton the same term.             These -- these were not appointed by the prosecutor; they were appointed by the court?             Am I right?             And you say that's inadequate.    We have to have a full adversarial trial of psychiatric experts in every case where a prisoner claims that he's not mentally competent to be executed.             It doesn't seem to me, and there's nothing in our history that requires, that you need a full dress trial to decide this issue.                  And it seems to me perfectly reasonable for the trial court to appoint experts, not selected by the prosecutor but selected by the judge, and have them conduct the -- the examination of the individual. I, I certainly don't want to -- you know -- a full dress trial on this issue in every case.                  And I, I don't know anything in our, in our tradition of due process that requires it.              You -- you -- you did have your own expert, though?           You had one expert of your own, right?    No?              Well.              Who was --               This very important matter is going to be decided on the basis of the opinion of one, one justice, what, 30 years ago?              You have no other appeal to a long tradition of how we determine this matter, but just one opinion by one justice because he was the lowest common denominator on the Court at that time. That seems to me very peculiar.              We didn't have incarceration.              We didn't have incarceration extending back a thousand years.                  We -- we had misdemeanors and felonies, all of which were punishable by death.               Rational understanding of what?   That's -- that's the problem.                     Rational understanding of what.        The State says he has rational understanding of the fact that he is going to die, and the reason he is going to die. Now, what -- what beyond that do you insist he have a rational understanding of?

06-6911 +++$+++                Mr. Coad, how are -- how are civil rights which have been taken away typically restored?     What is -- what is the process for restoring them?    Just if you don't commit another offense within a certain number of years?                 Well, you -- you can say, however, that -- that in the restoring situation, there is at least a greater individuation of the -- of the State's determination of the -- the trustworthiness of the individual to be -- to be trusted with arms. That is to say well, this person has not committed an offense within so many years.                     Or maybe in some States, it may be an individual determination. That's why I asked you the question.                     Is it ever one by one, you apply to have them restored?              Well, I mean, that's -- that's a totally different thing from just a gross determination by a State that everybody who commits this crime does not lose -- does not lose firearm rights. I think it's -- it's -- there's a greater degree of assurance when you're dealing with those States that -- that have some degree of individuation. At least this is an individual who hasn't committed an offense for so many years.           Or in those States where you have to apply personally, I think they're different situations.                But a misdemeanor?      I see.             Are you sure about that? (33) applies to a number of different crimes, it seems to me, within every State.          Are you sure that in none of those crimes the civil rights are not taken away for some of them, but are taken away for others?              But does it make much sense, as -- as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read (a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing? I mean, you know, why go to the trouble of putting in that provision if it's only going to make a difference in those -- in those very few States where -- well --              Can we rewrite statutes like that?    Because, gee, look at this statute. Congress didn't think about this, and it makes a really bad result here.     So we're going to add this -- this new -- I don't think that that's how we operate.              It's not that absurd if Congress did the same thing in (a)(33).

Of course, you have a problem not just with the presenting, not just with the pandering of it.    You have a problem with the mere possession of it.    You have to find some exception for that anyway.    You have to find some as- applied challenge exception for the mere possession of it, even if you don't pander it.                 Do we use a seven year old for the objective requirement?                 We would use a --                 -- reasonable adult, I had thought.

I am less concerned about the fact that the candidate can't say I'm the -- I'm the no-taxes candidate, than I am about the fact that he can associate himself with the Republican Party or the Democratic Party on the ballot and that party has no opportunity on the ballot to say, we have nothing to do with this person.    That it seems to me is a great disadvantage to the parties.             I'm not talking about a First Amendment forced association.                      I'm talking about an association for purposes of making this a fair election at which the parties have an opportunity to nominate and support their own candidates.                      And what this system creates is a ballot in which an individual can associate himself with the Republican Party, but on the ballot the Republican Party is unable to dissociate itself from that candidate.             Will, will it say whether the party that is preferred likes this candidate?             I think you can say yes or no to that.    Will it say whether the party for which he expresses a preference claims or disclaims him?             Please answer yes or no. Will it say whether the party for which he has expressed a preference claims or disavows him?             All right.             Is -- Iis there any, what should I say, truth investigation by the State of Washington?    Suppose a candidate who has been a Democrat all his life, has run for office as a Democrat, agrees with all the positions of the Democratic Party, chooses to state on the ballot:         I prefer the Republican Party. That's okay?             I guess -- how can you say it's false?             If he thinks he prefers it, I guess he prefers it, even though it's contrary to his entire life.              I don't think it's enough that -- that there's no claim of party endorsement. There is a claim of associating himself with the party, and if he associates himself with the party it seems to me the party should be able to disassociate itself from him.   And I think it harms the party not to permit that.              General MCKenna, I'm interested in how this new system meshes with the otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election laws.    For example, the major political parties have a certain -- certain benefits that are not given to minor parties, and the major parties are determined on the basis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I think it's 5 percent, in a statewide election.                How are you going to figure out whether the Republican Party has, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is somebody who expresses a preference for the Republican Party, although he's not really a Republican?              And they have not devised a structure that we know of?                 One of the briefs says that the Republicans -- I think the Republicans or the Democrats checked with the, with the State election officials who said that there's no provision for convention, for nomination by convention.                 So they can-- they can conduct conventions if they wish?             I did, too.             You should have said that.
06-7517 +++$+++                Well, you know this -- this provision 32(h), really doesn't -- does simply not work with post-Booker guidelines.            You either have to say it was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand it beyond what it says, because may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified, under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified grounds for departure. And you had some -- the court could look at those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if so I'll let him know.      But you can depart now simply on the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a ground of departure? It's simply a ground of disagreement, I would suppose.   Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply. Simply has no -- no application under the new system? Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines system?   Which is a much narrower category of departures.               I don't think it is counter-intuitive to provide -- to -- to require notice when the number of grounds is finite.                     But if the number of grounds is infinite, I'm much less inclined to read it as even applicable to the situation.              Post-Booker the guidelines are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as to the sentence. Now, in the bad old days, when the statute said 20 to 40, and the judge decided to give you 40, he didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you the highest sentence. And now that we've returned to a system that is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement that didn't exist under the -- under the pre-pre-Booker system?              And there's --              -- a pre-sentence report which both parties have.          And sometimes there are witnesses who come in.        Sometimes the injured parties or the relatives of the deceased party come in; and -- and usually the sentence is imposed at the end of that proceeding. Now when is -- when is the judge supposed to be so precise as to what particular matters induce her to -- to raise this sentence here?              Are you going to have a recess?   Or maybe reschedule the sentencing for -- for a week later so that the judge can decide in detail what particular factors motivate her?              Now if it is in the pre-sentence report, is that enough notice?              So long as it is in the pre-sentence notice the judge doesn't have to say I plan to rely on this aspect of the pre-sentence report?              Okay.              It's not what it meant when 32(h) was promulgated.              You could apply departure to post-Booker; but at the time this rule was adopted, departure did not consist of that; it consisted of something much more narrow.
06-766 +++$+++                The State has not allowed it.     The State has required it, no?               Although if we -- if we hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State merely to allow it, wouldn't it?                So that this manner of selecting judges in any other State, if it has been voluntarily adopted by the party, would be unconstitutional?               What if --      what if it were the parties that objected to this and not some individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in the party?   What if the parties said, we don't want to select our candidates this way?              Is it clear that the State could impose it upon them?             Well, the State can restrict that right if it wants to.                      The State can require the party to select its candidates by -- by primary.             Or by convention.             But if the State wants to do it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.             Well, but that -- but that's not the issue here.           The State and the party are in agreement.             The State is not trying to coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't want to do.              Have we -- have we imposed any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State? That is to say, have we held that the Constitution itself imposes certain restrictions?              Yes.      I want a case where the State did not impose the restriction and it was up to us to decide whether the State could do that or not, but rather the State said the party can do whatever it wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself chose under no compulsion from the State --             -- on the basis of some constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection Clause --             -- or the Thirteenth amendment.               Well, the parties are not protesting in this case, are they?               If and when that situation arises, I suppose we can -- we can decide it.                  But it's not here.   The parties are totally happy with this and would do it on their own.               In fact, it is probably likely the parties got this system adopted by the New York legislature.               You're not saying the State could compel that?               You're saying that the State could permit it?
06-7949 +++$+++               Lex Luthor might. (Laughter.)               Well, you don't -- you don't have to answer all of these things for your case, do you?               You're not saying that a reasonable person couldn't have found the opposite. You're just saying that a reasonable person could have found what this district judge found.               So why don't you just swallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the court of appeals could say that, but --               -- but my point stands?              It looked at them.   It didn't necessarily follow them.              With white collar crime, for example, it went vastly higher than what had been the practice.               And another circuit would develop the opposite.     I mean, this circuit would say that 17 is unreasonable.        The other circuit would say that 19 is unreasonable.        And we would have to sort out all those things ultimately, right?              In kind of a sentencing review court?              Of course, all these questions only -- only apply to departures downward from the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with regard to departures upward you do run into constitutional problems when the -- when courts of appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be found in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts that justify moving upward. So you end up with a quite skewered system in which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of departures downward, but -- but very, very slight review of departures upward.             You think that's unreasonable?             Excuse me.           You're saying they can't disagree with the policy.                      They can only -- only say there are special facts in this case that were not taken into account in the policy.                      But you're saying they are bound by the policy set forth in the Guidelines.    That's not my understanding of either Apprendi or Booker.             Which yes and which no?             It has to be relevant to the case, Of course.             Of course.             I don't know what you mean by rationally grounded in the case before them.                      Let's take the question of whether you should give higher sentences for crack cocaine than for powder cocaine. Why can't the district court simply disagree with the fact that the Guidelines said you should give a 100 times more for the one than for the other?                      Why can't the district court just say, that seems to me a very erroneous judgment by -- by the Sentencing Commission?             I see.           It must follow the Guidelines,             It just has to consider them.   It did consider them and said:                    I disagree with that judgment of the Guidelines.                 This case involves cocaine.
06-8120 +++$+++                 Well, it's a direct product of the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems to me the search incident to the arrest is legal.                     And are you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that whatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require you -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and you find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you don't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the car.    You can arrest the person, right?               So the arrest is legal.            If the arrest is legal, then the search incident to it must be legal.              What if the car -- you know, the car doesn't come to a complete stop.                      The same facts that Justice Breyer just gave you.                      It's creeping along at, you know, a foot a minute.                      And then he says to these other people, you can jump out and go wherever you like, or you know, or go back to, to my partner's car.     Then they wouldn't have been stopped; is that right?              So you're putting all the eggs into the basket that the, the car came to a complete stop and therefore they have been seized.                      And what is crucial for the seizure is the elimination on motion on the part of the car.              Any elimination of motion in a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes, at the request of the authorities, constitutes a seizure?              But not if you're still rolling a little bit, a foot a minute. (Laughter.)              What about a shutdown of an airport?   You know, there is word that somebody has been seen walking in with a bag of explosives or it looks like a bag of explosives, so they stop all planes on the tarmac, shut down all exits to the airport until they can ascertain what this bag is.              Everybody in the airport and everybody in those planes has been seized for Fourth Amendment purposes?              Okay, just the people who were trying to leave the airport.                They had just arrived and they were going to go out to catch a cab and go home.   They have been seized.                 Well, it turns out that there wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable person would have thought.            This was a knitting bag and some foolish cop thought it was a bag of explosives. That would have made it unreasonable.                     So everybody in the airport who is on the way home has been seized and has a cause of action.                 What have we done in a case, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done in a case where there is a warrantless entry in violation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's apartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does not belong to the owner of the apartment?                   My impression is that, that the owner of that suitcase has not been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; is that correct?
06-8273 +++$+++                And you think that our holding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going to let you out of jail?               You think that's really what we said in Teague, that even though your constitutional rights were violated, we're going to foreclose the remedy of habeas corpus?                 I -- I find it difficult to believe that that -- you know, any responsible court could make such a determination.                  And I think it is --                  Is it not a substantive determination of Federal law when you say that this constitutional change that we're making in this case or that we have made in a past case is not retroactive? That means there was no constitutional violation in the past prior to the announcement of this case, and what the State -- what you want the State court to be able to say is yes, there is a Federal constitutional violation for which we're going to give a remedy in habeas.               I think that's exactly what Crawford means, and I think that's exactly what happened.   That's what it means, whether it's a new rule.   What does a new rule mean?               It means it didn't used to be the rule, but it is the rule after this case. Now, you can argue, and there are many originalists who would agree with you, that there shouldn't be such a thing as a new rule, but once you've -- once you've agreed that there can be new rules, if this Court says this is a new rule, we acknowledge it wasn't the rule before, but it's new, it will not have retroactive effect, it seems to me that the State would be contradicting that ruling by saying oh, in our view the law used to be exactly what you say it newly is.             My position is we have asserted all that power in the world. (Laughter.)                Mr. Butler, let me -- this is a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come up in a -- in a direct appeal to the State Supreme Court.   Is it your position that in a direct appeal, the State can determine to be retroactive constitutional rights that we have said are not retroactive, on direct appeal, now, not habeas?              If it bases its decision on the Federal Constitution, and we have said that this Federal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what -- what do they say on a direct appeal?              And my next question is going to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us, what do we do?              My case was not in the pipeline.   The prosecution began after our new decision. Okay?   And it comes up to the State Supreme Court.                    Can the State Supreme Court, despite the fact that we've said the decision is not retroactive, make it retroactive?   And your answer is yes?               Habeas or not?              That always assumes that that's a remedial question, and that the question is not was the Constitution violated at the time this act occurred.   That -- if that's the question, then you acknowledge that the State can't change the situation.               I assume that the State executive can do that with respect to any Federal law that it's authorized to implement, simply choose not to, couldn't it?   That's prosecutorial discretion.               Then do you think the State is free to decide how and when and whether it will, quote, apply?   I mean, simply to separate the law from the application of the law seems to me no answer at all. Is there any other area where you say well, yes, there was a Supreme Court decision; but whether to apply that decision is up to the State?
06-84 +++$+++                 Well, it's also used in the phrase "knowing and willfully."             That appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.               In one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful.               You mean willfully alone?               Where -- where it -- where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts?                  If you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?              How about reckless disregard?              Suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful.                    Lawyers are in disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it. Is that a willful violation?             But I think I'm violating.             I'm a better lawyer than my advisors. (Laughter.)             Would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?              Or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?              I must say that -- that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law.              You're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.              I mean, if I know that what I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating the law.              How do you fit, how do you fit that within the language of the statute?                    Is it, I fail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had. Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance?                    No.   Is it an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance?   I find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language.             I read the term as, as one of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate. The earlier part refers to the rate.                    An increase in any charge for, that's the rate.            And then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage.               I mean, that is, you know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of the insurance, whether you're insured for --              Which is where?              Thank you.
06-856 +++$+++               What are the code numbers of those?    I really get confused with you people who work with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know Section 3 of ERISA.      I use the code.                 What -- what code sections are you talking about?                Thank you.              But that wasn't in the record.              It is in the record.               That's fine, so why doesn't he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?               Because the plan owes him this money.     And if the plan turns around and says well, you know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way it was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money, doesn't it?              I'm talking about (a)(1)(B).              Well, there is -- there is this to suggest that only -- only that manner of proceeding preserves the structure of -- of the legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you come into court; and interpreting it that way would preserve that -- that exhaustion requirement.               You have to apply to the plan first, and if you establish that the plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan and you can sue in court.              Let me come back to your earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) -- it's actually a requirement of 1109 --   -- is not met.                 And that is -- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach.                 In these welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't the plan have to provide those benefits?              And that would be a loss to the plan.                Right.                I have an entitlement to certain -- certain welfare payments.                Right.                Right.                It does if you sue the plan and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's failure to do what he was supposed to.                Well, but that would preserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion requirement first.      You apply to the plan and say the plan owes me this cancer treatment, and the plan says "yes, we do" or "no, we don't."                If it says "yes, we do," it's liable to you and then the plan can -- can recover over against the trustee.              Well, it isn't just if the money is payable to him today.              It says, "to enforce his rights under the terms or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan."              And if there's no money in his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to clarify that even if there is no money in his account the plan owes him future benefits in that amount.              Right.              But the plan wouldn't necessarily pay out any money.                What would happen is, after the administrative determination by the plan that it does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the money and the plan would implead the trustee who was responsible for this.        It ends up the same way.              What would happen if the trustee does not have the money?                 The trustee not only squandered your client's money; he squandered his own. He's just really in bad shape.                He has no money to cough up.     What happens to your client?               Doesn't your client get that money from the plan anyway?              By picking, as you put it, by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?              What's the answer to it?              They participated in the plan.    It was a failure of the trustee for the plan.                 It seems to me the whole plan should be liable for it.                        I mean that's how I --                Mr. Roberts, Section (a), (a)(1)(B) --                Unlike Section (a)(2), which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued. Under 1109 it's clear who gets sued.                      It's the fiduciary who gets sued.     I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B) just says a civil action may be brought to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to clarify his right under the terms of the plan.                I think the implication there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.                Where?                 It may well.       But I'm just talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me that the logical reading of that is that the suit is against the plan.              Is that 1132 we are talking about?               Of the United States Code.               It's useful to have a code. It really is.
06-9130 +++$+++                Counsel, what do you do about the later -- the later statute that makes an exception to the exception?               I mean it clearly, the exception to the exception says that -- that the exception is applicable to any claim based on injury or loss of goods or merchandise, if among other requirements, the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property. Now that's more than customs and tax -- any provision of Federal law.                Why do you need that exception to the exception if the exception doesn't cover anything except customs and tax in the first place?              They didn't -- they didn't need that if indeed it covered all seizures by -- by customs and tax officers and nobody else.                   If that's all it -- it covered, what -- you know, this doesn't achieve anything.   The purpose of under any provision of Federal law.   It seems to me that that envisions seizure under laws other than tax and customs.               Now you're saying there is one, one such law that tax and customs officers sometimes use?              What work does it do?         What work under your interpretation does that later provision do, if property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing for the forfeiture of property?              Right.
06-923 +++$+++               What do you mean by -- let's get straight by what we mean by "in actuality conflicted."    Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial interest in actuality conflicted?              And aren't we talking in this case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality conflicted.              No.    That's, that's a conflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its judgment.    But the conflict exists whether you, whether you give it effect or not.              So let's call that a conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties, whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his judgment.              But you're saying it doesn't make any difference.           You say you should take it into account, but if it was a reasoned decision, which is the test whether or not he's a fiduciary, if it's a reasoned decision the fact that he's a fiduciary makes no difference, right?     Isn't that what you're saying?              It does make a decision then.    What was a reasoned decision for someone who doesn't have a conflict becomes an unreasoned decision simply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict?              Ms. Posner, it seems to me that that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether or not the person making the decision has a conflict.               I mean that smells bad or doesn't smell bad, as you say, either way.              And I am still -- listen, I know that we're responsible for this because we said it in Firestone.   We said that a conflict of interest should be weighed as a factor.               If that means anything, it seems to me it means that sometimes that weight will make the difference.       So at least sometimes -- but you're not willing to admit that -- at least sometimes you would say, oh, yes, this is a reasonable decision and had this decision been made by a fiduciary without a conflict, it would be perfectly okay because it's reasonable.   That's the test.             However, since this fiduciary has a conflict, what was a reasonable decision, whoof, the added weight, it becomes an unreasonable decision.              Is that what you mean by giving it some weight?              You do.              So a perfectly reasonable decision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a conflict?              What did you just say?    I don't understand that.        The conflict was intended by the employer.   He appointed the --              Was intended by the --

06-939 +++$+++                Why do you say the labor policy promotes it?       It certainly permits it, but what -- what --              No, I'm talking about the -- the Federal policy.        You say the Federal policy promotes this employer speech.               Why do you say it promotes it?    It clearly permits it.                   It clearly does not discourage it, but is that the same as promoting it?               Even if he guesses right, he is subject to the litigation.               You said if he guesses wrong, he is subject to litigation.                     He is subject to the litigation even if he guesses right.              Why do you say it's a very different case Mr. Hungar?           I don't really understand it.             It was labor policy.       I mean, you have to acknowledge it was labor policy in these other cases, just a different labor policy that the Federal Government wanted, right?             Right.
06-969 +++$+++                  Maybe we were wrong last time.              Well, we didn't have a concrete case such as this one, in which the assertions of the other side are very appealing as far as the rights of citizens to band together for an issue ad, even an issue ad that names somebody who's up for election within, within 90 days.               We didn't that have appealing case before us.          Now that we have it before us and now that you tell us that this is a typical case, maybe we were wrong about the overbreadth challenge before.               Well, did that statement refer only to issue ads, or did it refer to all ads?               Right, and here we are dealing with a subset of all ads and that is issue ads. So that statement doesn't necessarily speak to whether, you know, a vast majority of all issue ads have to be --               I don't know if that's so. So long as that statement applied to the totality of ads, many of which were ads just directed at defeating particular candidates, I don't see how you can see that we're bound by that statement.               Everything that is not express advocacy is an issue ad?                The world is divided into express advocacy and issue ads?               I wouldn't divide it that way.   I would think there are a lot of express advocacy ads.   I think there are a lot of non-express advocacy ads that are not issue ads.             It doesn't your case, with me at least, for you to tell us that it is your job to say that no as-applied challenge will suffice.             I mean, that doesn't inspire me with confidence in what you're telling us.             No.     There is -- there is a claim here that there -- that there was difficulty in setting, setting up a fund in time to do what had to be done with respect to this issue, which was a distinctive issue that had come up and they said we didn't have time to set up a - a - a - a separate PAC that, that would effectively meet the problem.             Why isn't that distinctive enough?               Well now -- but -- yes, it may make the difference in a close election but it is also, it is also likely to be more effective with regard to the Senator that you -- whose vote you want on the issue.   Are you, are you going to waste your, waste your money in, in those districts where the Senator is not going to vote the way you want no matter what?                 The situation you pose is precisely the one where you would want your issue ad to run.             Of course.             To get the Senator's attention.             The Senator who is, who is at risk is likely, is likely to listen.                 The Senator who has a safe seat is not.             You can't tell which of the two they had in mind.       Whether they wanted the Senator defeated or they wanted to put enough pressure on the Senator that he would change his vote with regard to the filibuster.    I would think that the latter is more likely the motive than the former.                  And why do you assume the worst?              But this is -- this is the First Amendment.     We don't make people guess whether their speech is going to be allowed by Big Brother or not.   If you are going to cut off the speech, there ought to be a clear line.            Not whether -- whether I, I had ads against Feingold in the past or whether Feingold voted 20 times against this or, or half of the time against this.     It seems to me you need a clear First Amendment line.     And you're not giving us any.                 That vast majority thing, is that a -- was that the holding of the case?                    I mean --                 Every -- every -- every word that we it uttered in that prior case is law?                      I mean, what if -- am I free to think -- is the lower court free to think that maybe it is really not the vast majority?   But just because we said vast majority, it is like writing it into the statute?                Yeah.              Is this true of the NRA also?     Is it the case that they have never targeted, so to speak, a particular legislator?              I don't think they would either.     Why pick on the ACLU?              Does that go to their meaning or to the intent of -- is that what governs? It's the intent of the person who puts it on?                I thought -- I thought you were focusing on the meaning of it, what it conveys to the public.              That's new to me.      I thought you were asking us to look at the meaning.                  What does it mean to the --              You have to speculate before you try to put the ad on.              You have to speculate whether the Court is going to say well, since you're in the zone of three different radio stations or television stations, a different rule applies.                     Doesn't the person who wants to speak have to speculate, roll the dice?
06-984 +++$+++                  That's not such an outrageous proposition.          You'd certainly acknowledge that the President and the Senate could not enter into a treaty that required the States to do something that was unconstitutional.                 So there would be the situation that presents the shocking situation you've just described.     There is a treaty, but nonetheless it cannot be enforced domestically.             It's self-enforcing.      I thought you --             I thought you -- you think this treaty is self-enforcing.               You don't really need the President's order here.              This is not of a nature to be enforced in a judicial proceeding in Texas.                Texas has procedural rules that disable the Texas court from complying with the ICJ judgment here.                    Are you telling me that the ICJ judgment empowers either Federal or State courts to do things which -- which their laws do not permit them to do?              And -- and do you know of any other Federal law that -- that interferes in the -- in the procedures of State criminal courts, directs them as to what -- what procedures they have to have?              Really?              Where?           I don't know what you're talking about unless you're talking about constitutional requirements.           Of course, those are binding on the States.      But you're saying that the Federal Government can prescribe State court procedures and authorize State courts to do things which -- which the State government does not authorize them to do?              You don't agree with the last statement.              We would have no -- according to you, we would have no obligation to enforce this judgment but for the President's action?              We could decide to go back, too.   But would we have any authority to do it?             Wait a minute.      In order to get it to the Security Council, you have to take some affirmative action not to comply?                It's just not enough simply not to comply?              I thought that was tte point of Justice Ginsburg's comment, that there had been no decision not to comply.          Don't you need an affirmative decision to comply?              I know you agree, but it depends on whether it's up to the President to make that call.   Usually when we have treaties that are not self- enforcing the judgment of whether that international law obligation shall be made domestic law is a judgment for the Congress. Congress passes a law to enforce the treaty, and you're telling us that, well, we don't need the Congress; the President can make a domestic law by writing a memo to his attorney general.              They were not parties to it.     What do you mean, "covered by the judgment?"     Is this some -- some new kind of new kind of jurisdiction?     If you're named in a suit by somebody else, you somehow acquire rights under that suit?                   I don't know of any such principle.             These people were not parties to the -- the countries were parties to the judgment.               The President espousing the judgment -- Texas takes the position that this memorandum has -- has no legal effect; it's a memorandum from the President to the -- to his attorney general. It's not a directive to the States.                      In fact, it even refers to pursuant to the principles of comity, which suggests, you know, do it if you want to be cooperative, don't do it if you don't want to be cooperative. What is your response to that?                     And would it be enough if the President simply wrote a memorandum to himself saying that, I think this is the way that the -- that the judgment of the ICJ should be enforced?                     He doesn't have to tell Texas.             He can just tell his attorney general?               Put precisely, it would be making it Federal law and then applying it.             If you assume it's not self-executing, somebody has to make it to domestic law.   Now, Congress can obviously do it by passing a law. But you're saying the Court can do it, can make it dmestic law and then enforce it.               Yes, yes, ys.
06-989 +++$+++                Indeed, are there not such things as nonbinding arbitration's?                Which in effect say that when we're done the district court will do it as an original matter.              Excuse me.       I'm just not following this discussion.            Does it assume that you can bring an action on the contract and just bypass the provision of the contract which says there will be arbitration?     How can you do that?                You -- you don't assert you can do that?              You clearly can't do that.              So somebody has to decide on this arbitration provision.              But this -- but this one isn't, and if we say that you lose under the Federal Arbitration Act, is it open to the State court to say, well, that's what the Federal Arbitration Act says, but we handle arbitration differently?              I think if you lose on the arbitration here, you've got to lose on the arbitration before State court.              I mean you don't have to admit that.     That's --             That is, indeed, the issue. What we're arguing about here is whether 9 and 10 are simply default rules that apply where the parties have not otherwise specified.        That's -- and that's, arguably, what the New York law and the Illinois -- I -- I don't know that any of those cases cited by the other side involved cases where the Illinois rule or the New York rule was applied in the teeth of an arbitration agreement that said something differently.             In other words, I think both the Illinois rule and the New York rule were default rules.             And you're arguing that this is the default rule?              You think -- you think the State can enforce an arbitration award that would not be enforceable under the FAA?                Remind me why Section 9 doesn't get you there -- because of the "if" clause.                If the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of a court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to -- but they have agreed to that, haven't they?                The question is simply --                Why is, why is that condition excluded from the "if" clause, but all of the other conditions that are set forth in 10 are not excluded from the "if" clause?               I mean, it seems to me the "if" clause must embrace any conditions.

07-10374 +++$+++               He can still get that in Federal court, can't he?              But it's okay for the State to say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts? That would be all right?              That's strange.           Why -- but it can't do the lesser thing of saying, we don't want this particular type of tort action.                      One is jurisdictional -- you would say it's jurisdictional, right?    And this one is not jurisdictional, just because it's narrower?     It's still directed to the type of action.              But -- but not if New York said, we don't want any tort actions.                     What about if New York says, we don't want any -- uh -- personal injury tort actions?     Would that be enough, or is that too narrow?     And I'm going to narrow it down after that until I get down to your case. (Laughter.)              I understand that.       I just don't understand -- you acknowledge it's okay if it's jurisdictional; and you acknowledge that it is jurisdictional if you don't allow any tort actions.                I just don't know what makes this to be non-jurisdictional.     I don't know.              No, we would discuss what is analogous.             But you have acknowledged that it would be okay and would be a jurisdictional rule if the court -- if the State courts did not entertain tort actions.   That's a rule that goes to the substance of the claim, isn't it?                Yes, it's picking and choosing tort claims.                Yes.                 I find it hard to regard this as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books before there were any of these 1983 actions.
07-10441 +++$+++               Why can't you argue that what happens when you are not within the safe harbor is simply that the time period cannot alone govern, all right, but it can still be part of the list of things that can be taken into account in determining voluntariness under (b).           Why doesn't that reconcile the two provisions?               But admissibility is defined in 3501 itself.         (A) says that it shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given; and (b) says what factors will be taken into account in determining whether it's voluntarily given.               I agree with that.      It is not alone enough.               So if you are outside of that safe harbor you cannot rely upon the time alone. But why can't you rely on the time plus the other factors?               It's not being admissible solely on the basis -- I'm sorry.                 Delay is not the only factor being considered in making the inadmissibility call.   Delay is one of the things; whereas, within the safe harbor delay can't be taken into account at all.               Right.               No.     It -- it leaves it in effect only if you ignore (a) and (b). (A) says that it's admissible if it's voluntary --               -- and (b) says it's voluntary if you take into account the five factors, one of which is the period of time before arraignment.               But they are synonymous as used in (a).              (A) says that if it's -- it's admissible if it's voluntary.                Mr. MCColgin, what do you do with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay longer than six hours nondestructive of the admissibility of the confession if the delay beyond six hours "is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge or other officer." I can think of a lot of reasons why you can't do it within six hours other than the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled.                You see, if you take the government's position that it really doesn't matter, it gets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those factors into account, and the ultimate question is whether the confession was reasonable. But if you take your position, the defendant automatically walks, or at least his confession is automatically thrown out, and the only exception made is if the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled made six hours impracticable.             Right.             Well, that certainly is a very back-door way of doing it, isn't it?

And when was the -- when was the conviction and the sentence of death pronounced?               And you want to go back down again, for another --               How old is this -- is this defendant?                How many claims were -- was this a case where there, what, 81 separate claim counts?

Well, you know, I'll give you the first, that he appeared drunk or high.              That's pretty clear, but I think you tend to look wild-eyed after you're running out after a jewelry store robbery, and I think you're -- you're certainly inclined to look "agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied manner" when you've just committed two brutal murders.

Mr. Friedman, aren't there States that have been proceeding this way even before we came down with our opinion?        And which States are they?        And they are not under water, are they?        What was that adjective?           I like that.        Orthogonal?        Ooh. (Laughter.)           I think we should use that in the opinion. (Laughter.)
07-1122 +++$+++                  Of course, for a Terry -- for a Terry pat down you don't need, do you, articulable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous?                    So long as you have a suspicion of unlawful activity, you can stop the individual and pat down.                    Do you have to have, in addition to stopping the individual, an articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous?                 Both armed and dangerous?              Well, but I -- I thought you said that there has to be an articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous.              A bulge would not be enough to conduct a pat down after a Terry stop, therefore.              Well, then why should it be enough to -- to justify a pat down here?              No, I understand.          I weigh all the factors, and there's nothing but a bulge.              Okay.       So the bulge alone -- Well, whether I believe?              There has to be, you know, a reasonable basis for --              -- an articulable basis for the belief, right?              So I don't see why a bulge alone would -- would satisfy.              We have a whole separate line of cases apart from the Terry stop cases which allow officers to protect themselves by conducting a search of the surrounding area when they arrest somebody.    And that justifies a pat down of the person that they arrest also, doesn't it?              Whether or not they think that -- that he's about to -- to draw the gun and shoot them.              Why wouldn't that line of cases be extendible to this kind of a situation?              Why -- why during a traffic stop shouldn't they be able to ensure their own safety by -- by patting down the people who have been stopped, whether or not they have an articulable suspicion that they are about to draw and shoot?               But that's not what you're proposing, is it?              Yes.              Why -- why go the Terry route instead of the route that -- that covers search of the area around the person who is arrested?              Why -- why had this descended from a -- a seizure to a post-seizure consensual encounter?     Why was the seizure over?              Well, it seems to me you're -- you're acknowledging that she said that it was a purely -- you're not arguing it as based on a purely consensual encounter?     I thought that that's what you --              Even though she said so?              Okay.              What do you -- what do you say about the other -- the other side's point that in the case of a Terry stop there's a -- a mutually enforcing -- reinforcing aspect? You have a suspicion that -- there is crime afoot to begin with, plus the -- the suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous; whereas, here, you know, it's a traffic stop is all.              So what -- what is required where you think criminal activity is afoot is not necessarily going to be the same as what's required when you -- when there's just a traffic stop.
07-1125 +++$+++                Maybe the question ought to be whether this Court intended to have the Title IX action which it invented preclude 1983.                Why don't we look to the intent of this Court?              Mr. Rothfeld, we were -- we were warned about all these problems in the brief in opposition, weren't we?              Didn't that focus almost entirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of action anyway?              And we nonetheless granted -- granted cert?              Well, does that provision apply only when there is a Title IX cause of action?              Oh well, if it doesn't, then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree with your position.              They thought only in cases where there is no Title IX action.              Oh, you don't think they mean whether there is a valid claim?                   Even when there is a claim that isn't allowed under the law?
07-1209 +++$+++                 Why do you say that?      That it was understood so?      Because of the Attorney General's commentary on that?
07-1216 +++$+++                  Excuse me.        What -- what issue was debated here four times?              Did our opinion decide that -- that question?    Did our opinion say that that question was decided against your opponent?
07-1223 +++$+++                Why wouldn't he have brought that new evidence to the attention of the State court first?    Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the attention of the State court?               Well, he could have a post-conviction proceeding in the State court.               A State habeas.              Mr. Bress, this case involves Section 2254(d), right?               Does that appear somewhere in the briefs?         It would be nice to have it in front of me.              I mean, it's a central thing the case is about.         I cannot find it in any of the briefs.   Appendix to the petition for cert; I got -- I got to go back to that.        Don't you think it's important enough to be in your brief?               Well, you know, it does read -- 2254(e) -- it does read, "a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence."               That sounds like exactly what you're describing, the discovery of DNA evidence you didn't know about.               Mr. Bress, I want to apologize to you for accusing you of not printing 2254(d) and (e) in your brief.              You indeed did.             I'm grateful for your not throwing it in my teeth. (Laughter.)
07-1239 +++$+++                Say it again?      I'm not sure I --              Look, the problem you face -- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these alternative arrangements.          But you should not be estopped from arguing that at the time the EA was issued that was not a good faith completion of all the Navy's responsibilities.    And that's the argument that is being made against you now.       It assumes that the EA wasn't enough.   And I'm not sure that we -- that that assumption is valid.             Well, yes, you do, but it may not be in the circuits.             Our cases say that procedural injury alone is not the kind of injury that confers standing; that there has to be some concrete harm.             And -- and the only injury that -- that follows from the mere failure to file an EIS is -- is a procedural injury that affects the entire population.                The EA demonstrates in your view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that this -- this action by the Navy is okay.                 And since that is the case, there is -- there is no probability of irreparable harm; to the contrary, there is the probability of no irreparable harm because of the EA.                In all -- in all of these cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary.                     So if the mere allegation that it was necessary gives rise to an allegation of irreparable harm, you are going to get a preliminary injunction in all cases?              Can I -- before you sit down.   I thought I recalled something in your briefing dealing with the beaching -- your friend made a point regarding the beaching of beaked whales, that very substantially showed that they were caused by sonar. You had something in your briefs about beaching, but I wasn't sure whether it was beaked whales or only dolphins.
07-1309 +++$+++                   What -- what do you mean by that precisely?   Suppose you have a group of people, the ringleader goes and gets a safecracker, he gets a wheelman, and so forth, all the people he needs for the crime; and he says we are going to call this the -- the Brinks Job Group, okay?          We are the Brinks Job Group. But that's the only thing that he has put the group together in order to do.           But it's still a group.          He calls it a group and he gets all these guys together and they -- they meet and have lunch together, and do a lot of stuff together. Would that meet your -- your condition of a separate association from the predicate acts?                Except insofar as it is directed to the Brinks job.              Why -- why do you need a hierarchy?    Why do you need a boss?                     Why can't it be a democratic mob?    I mean, there is no boss and they agree that all of their decisions will be taken unanimously?             Well, that's what you requested.    Isn't -- isn't that the instruction you requested?
07-1315 +++$+++               Well, I guess it could be -- it could be if we have an opinion that makes it clear that you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in -- in certain cases.      And if the State court did not grant an evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that was contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't you?                But unless -- unless there is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an evidentiary hearing could show that the State court decision, which was legitimately held without an evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions.                     I don't see how you can do that.              Why -- why should we hold a hearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical situation that Justice Souter mentioned?               Why shouldn't we just reverse the State courts for not having held an evidentiary hearing?      Remand it to them, let them hold it, and let -- let them make the factual determination on the basis of that, after which we would -- we would apply the rather strict 2254 standard to -- to the result of that hearing?              No, I understand that.    So your -- your answer to Justice Souter would -- would not be that -- that you can conduct a hearing if the State should have conducted a hearing?              What you should do if the State should have conducted a hearing is send it back for the hearing.              Mr. Mercer -- Mr. Mercer, I guess we could resolve the case by saying if there was any error it was harmless, but we didn't take the case for that.   That wouldn't be very helpful to the bar, would it?   I mean, I thought that the important issue here is -- is the one you've been discussing, whether -- whether, in fact, you're bound to stick with the facts that were -- were adjudicated by the State.              So let's not do that, then. Let's -- let's decide something.             Good.               Excuse me.         The issue is not whether it's unreasonable or not.                      The issue is whether it's an unreasonable application of -- of clearly established Supreme Court law.               Reasonableness or unreasonableness is out of the question.                      You -- you first just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is it conceivably an unreasonable application of that.                        And the -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't decided the question of whether this is reasonable or unreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.               That's right.         That seems to me --
07-1356 +++$+++               When does -- when does the Sixth Amendment violation occur?              Do you -- do we have any other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching testimony, a constitutional violation results?                  It's parallel to the Fifth.             Ms. Saharsky, I am still a little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a constitutional violation.          General MCAllister said that in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow -- allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that is the actual constitutional violation.                 Isn't that the case other than in the Miranda situation?                I mean, suppose you have a generally coerced confession.                   Would we -- would we permit that to go in?               Exactly, but why -- why is not that the case with the right to counsel?               But its real meaning is that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?               Its root purpose is that counsel is guaranteed at trial.              And here we're saying it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's refuting a lie by the defendant.               So you say that -- you say the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?              That's right.
07-1372 +++$+++              That -- that would not?             Would it violate the Admission Act if the legislature had not said -- said we are giving it to them because we want to, because we think it's a good idea.        No, we are giving it to them because we think they have a right to it.             And we feel that we must give it to them because it's theirs.             Would that violate the Admission Act?              Did you answer my question just then?              Please, let me put my question again.     Let's assume that the legislature does not say, we want to give it to the Native Hawaiians because we like the Native Hawaiians or because we think they deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.               I think it would be.              Is -- is it the function of the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?              Would there be any problem -- certainly there is noted the legislature deems there to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that basis.   But do you -- do you think there -- there might be some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of Hawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and -- and giving away land on that basis?
07-1410 +++$+++                Is that in IMLA or is that in the Rehabilitation Act?                The other side says that certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not exist in this lease.        Is that accurate?                With the forms?
07-1428 +++$+++              They would not have discriminated against any particular --             -- white or -- or majority applicants in -- in that selection, which is what occurred here.   You had -- you had some applicants who were winners, and their -- their promotion was -- was set aside.   That doesn't exist in these hypotheticals at all.   It's just an abstract question of which of these two systems should be adopted.             What -- one of the briefs said that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of the briefs said part of the claim is that some of the things that this test tested for were not -- were not qualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven, although they might be needed in other fire departments. The test had not been localized.                Wasn't that part of the -- part of the objection?               Can I hear his answer to this one first?    I'm getting confused. (Laughter.)              They are at war with one another.              How can one avoid --             If it looks like or if the employer just in good faith believes?             When I say they're at war with one another, I mean they become at war with one another when you say that all that is necessary to permit intentional discrimination is the employer's good faith belief that if he didn't intentionally discriminate, he'd be caught in a situation of disparate impact.              At that point, they're at war with each other.              I'm sorry.              And a reasonable response to that, is your position?              Not just in response to that.              A reasonable --             And you would say that -- and I'm asking the same question the Chief Justice asked earlier -- you would say that if it had come out the other way --             And if there had been a disproportionate number of minorities who -- who passed the test --             You would say that it's neutral to set that test aside?             I don't think you'd say that.             It's whether it is -- it is neutral to set aside a test simply because one race predominates.             How you can call that race-neutral I -- I do not know.              Isn't that a controverted issue of fact?    How can you possibly get around that?               I mean, one side says what you say is just pretext; the real reason was just politics.   Isn't that an issue of fact that has to be tried?
07-1437 +++$+++                  You have to get rid of Quackenbush, too, don't you?                 Throw that overboard, too?               Well, that's right, but what if we want to get rid of it? (Laughter.)
07-1529 +++$+++                 I thought that the rationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply deemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed -- has expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or even to be represented by counsel.                 It isn't clear that, which is already a stretch, to assume that simply because I said, you know, I would like to have counsel, if the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you talk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's automatically coerced. But now you're saying, even if the defendant has never expressed even a desire to be represented by counsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact even if he doesn't know about the appointment of counsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed to be coerced.   That seems to me quite, even more extravagant than Jackson.                 Right.          Right.   What has he elected here?                 Why?     Why would one do that?             It is that, whether or not the defendant initiates the contact.                     I mean, in civil matters, it's contrary to the ethics of the bar to interrogate the party on the other side when you know he has a lawyer, and that would be the case even if he initiated it.    You wouldn't think of negotiating with him without consulting the other lawyer, saying, "Can I talk to your client?"       So that doesn't stretch over to this, to this situation. We're not applying bar ethical rules.                  We're applying, supposedly, a rule that determines when a confession is coerced.        All right?            That's what we're doing here.             Why couldn't we solve your practical problem that we don't know in many States whether the defendant accepted appointment or not, by simply saying it is not enough to simply accept appointment of counsel; you must have requested counsel. To merely say, "Oh, that's great, you appointed me counsel" --             You must have requested it. And that would be in accord with the holding of Michigan v. Jackson and would solve all of your -- all of your practical problems.                What happens under Michigan v. Jackson if I have never requested counsel?                  I've never asked the court to appoint counsel, but I've gone out and hired counsel of my own, right?                Is it clear from Michigan v. Jackson itself, or --              We wouldn't be saying that. We would just be saying that it is unrealistic to think that a confession is coerced simply because the police initiated the conversation so long as he said:                    Okay, I'll speak without my counsel present.                    That's all we -- I don't see how it would infect any of these other areas.     It would just say that's -- that's one bridge too far.     This is prophylaxis on prophylaxis.              That's true, but not much else.                That's a different question.              You have to assume that his voluntary relinquishment of it is somehow coerced.                    I mean there -- there is no way around that.                   The man has said:     I know I have counsel, but that's okay; I'll talk anyway.    And you say:      So long as the police have initiated that conversation, we will deem it to be coerced.     You can't get around the coercion aspect of -- of this matter.     But that question is whether that is at all realistic.              Mr. Verrilli, I don't understand your response to Justice Ginsburg.                       I mean, it seems to me, if this thing was going to come in anyway, how could you possibly say it was harmful and not harmless error?              What difference does it make whether it's introduced in the case in chief or whether it's introduced to refute the defendant's assertion that he didn't do it?
07-1601 +++$+++                I would have thought you would have similarly answered Justice Kennedy's question differently and would have said that just because something's wasted doesn't mean that it is waste.                     I mean, you may waste part of what is delivered, but what is spilled is -- it doesn't seem to me to be waste.
07-208 +++$+++                 But why is it necessary to have a special rule in order to prevent the trial from descending into a farce?          Why couldn't you simply apply the same rule of competency that you apply for whether the defendant can be tried, and then if in fact his self-representation begins to turn the trial into a farce surely the court would have the power to prohibit his further self-representation.                Certainly, turning a trial into a farce is a basis for the court's action; no?              The problem with taint would be his own fault.        I can't imagine that he would success on appeal claiming he tainted the jury.                    And the advantage of waiting is that by waiting to see if in fact he will turn the trial into a farce you avoid the risk of depriving him of his right to represent himself, which is certainly a very important constitutional right.   Why didn't you wait to see whether he's going to be able to pull it off or not?              Well, there must be precedents.    I'm sure under the old rule, if I can recall it the old rule, where you have a single standard for both the right to be tried -- the -- the ability to be tried and the right to represent yourself, there must have been instances in which the person who was representing himself was unable to cope and the trial was -- was turning into a farce.                There must have been instances.    What did they do?              Proceeds, that's what I thought.              What is your test that you're going to apply ex ante?               Whether he's able to coherently --              Yes, what's the test?              It's really a vague test, isn't it?                But surely his total ignorance of all of the trial rules, the hearsay rule and the other details of conducting a trial, is a great disadvantage.    But we allow him to toss that away so long as he knows he's tossing it away.                     That the judge instructs him:    You're ill-advised to proceed on your own; you're not a lawyer; this is, you know, a complicated process; are you sure you want to represent yourself?   And if he says yes, we say, well, you know, you've brought it on yourself. Why can't we say the same thing about his supposed inability to communicate effectively, unless and until he turns the trial into a farce?              What would the standard of review be?   I'm a reviewing court.                The judge has not allowed this person to represent himself.                   What's the standard of review?     Abuse of discretion or what?              Abuse of discretion?              And what's your test, the same test:   Inability to communicate no matter how idiotic?   I mean this man is living in a fantasy world. He understands that he's on trial, but his whole world is just -- he not only believes in Martians, he thinks we are all Martians, or something like that. I mean --              Why pick on just the ability to communicate?        It seems to me there are a lot of defects that can turn the trial into a farce.                Do you worry at all that if we adopt a separate test for the ability to represent yourself, that the inevitable effect will be for the test for being able to be tried to become less and less rigorous?                After all, there's no harm done so long as the person can't -- is not allowed to represent himself. I think there may be some value in linking the two, so that -- so that the court knows that if he finds the individual capable of being tried, he may have to begin a trial with this individual representing himself.              If it gets to be bad, the court can terminate it and say, you know, you can't represent yourself.     We're going to bring in counsel.              Sure, it could be done if the trial is, indeed, turning into a farce.              Well, why not just change the rule about what you can do, once the trial is under way?    You say sometimes it's not a farce.              It's just that this person is obviously incapable of making a coherent defense.    Why not wait to see? What I object to in the proposal is making these judgments ex ante on the basis of -- I don't know -- psychological testing or past behavior or anything else. Give it a try.         The person wants to represent himself.      It's his constitutional right.      If, indeed, it turns out that this is turning into a sham, fine, bring in a lawyer to represent him. But doing it beforehand on the basis of your prediction as to what the trial is going to turn into seems to me not to give enough respect to an individual's desire to represent himself.              Mr. Fisher, what if the defendant here promised to sit silent during the trial as the defendant did in Godinez?                Would that be -- would that render everything okay? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER              But, he could certainly sit silent.    Having decided to represent himself, he could, if he wished, just sit silent.                Maybe he writes badly.               How fair does a trial seem to the public where the defendant stands up and says, Your Honor, I want to represent myself?                   I do not want this attorney.    I want to defend myself.                 And the judge said, sit down, we have a psychological evaluation of you.    You can't represent yourself. How fair does that seem to the public?
07-21 +++$+++                Before -- before we get to that, can we talk about standing a little?                    Who are the -- who are the complainants here?               Courts below are sometimes wrong.               Well, they still have to identify individuals who are members.                    Now, what does it take to be a member of the Democratic Party here?               I thought -- I thought they took the position that anybody who voted or intended to vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.               Is there any way in which you can say -- and I thought this was the theory of associational standing -- that this individual has voluntarily given this organization the right to represent that person for particular purposes?               But that doesn't mean that I'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me for all sorts of purposes.          And these people can bring their own individual challenges.               I mean, I'm not questioning their ability to do it.                     But, but why is the Democratic Party their representative?               That organization had members.     I mean, you did join that organization.               And they identified members who would be, who would be annoyed by the noise.              Excuse me.       Even in its own right, it has to identify somebody that's a member or not.              Exactly, Democrats in particular, I suppose.              Well, did you have anybody who said, I don't have a voter ID?              I plan to come in this next election, I plan to vote, and I don't have a voter ID card?              Well, do we know that that religious exemption won't be made?              Do we know that that religious exemption won't be made?                 Nobody's asserted it.              No, no.          I mean in this case.   In this case you're claiming there's a problem for people who, for religious reasons, don't want to have their photograph taken.            Do we know that if that's the reason that they assert, I can't get the photograph, the State will say you can't vote?              It's not a burden if you're not indigent?              17 miles is 17 miles for the rich and the poor.              The people who are dead or have moved away would certainly not be objecting.              I wasn't talking about that.   I was talking about whether there is a genuine threat of fraud which the State is moving to eliminate --   -- and your assertion that, you know, it's not much of a problem because the person whom you're impersonating would find out about it.                I mean -- but that's certainly not the case for people who have moved away or people, you know, the people in the graveyards that are still on the rolls.              I'd say likely.               Who do you do with illiterates who don't have a signature?                 Do you match "Xs," or what?               Aren't there going to be problems under any system you imagine?             Well, if you want to talk about increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our judgment does more harm than good; whether -- whether the remedy for -- for the inconvenience to a small number of people is to wash away the whole statute, which in most of its applications is perfectly okay? Why don't we do that weighing of benefits and burdens of increments versus needs?
07-210 +++$+++               But that doesn't even comport with common-law civil cases.                     I mean, for a long time courts have allowed someone who's been euchred by a competitor's misrepresentations to his customers.           An old New York case that was discussed in the briefs that I used to teach in contracts class, where he told somebody that the horse was no longer for sale and it was still for sale, and the person who wanted to sell the horse at the higher price should have -- to buy the horse should have had a cause of action, even though the representation was not made to him.              Oh, I see, I see, I see. Okay. MR. DeBRUIN:        So in this case, we allege both a violation of 1962(c) and (d).                      1962(c) prohibits conducting the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.                  That pattern may consist of fraud, violence, bribery --              Why -- why is it -- I really worry about adopting a rule which would produce the result that whenever anyone makes a false statement in an official form, someone who is deprived of a business opportunity, or at least can say so, can bring a RICO action. MR. DeBRUIN:        Justice Scalia, I would say two things:    First of all, I think it's critical to realize that Congress enacted RICO to protect competitors.    One of the principal motivations behind RICO was to protect legitimate businesses that are injured in their business or property by reason of a pattern of racketeering activity as defined under the statute.   That's number one. Number two, there are important restrictions that this Court repeatedly has recognized.                     It's not enough that there be a single act.                  There must be predicate acts that are a pattern of activity. "Pattern" doesn't just mean two.                It means a continuing threat of continuing criminal activity.                   There must be proximate cause under Holmes and Anza.                   All of those restrictions exist.      And only if the plaintiff can successfully navigate all of those things, proving not common-law fraud but indictable criminal activity, proving a pattern of continuing criminal activity, proving proximate cause, only then can the plaintiff make out a RICO violation.
07-214 +++$+++                You're saying, in addition to being a claim, that's not enough reliability?            It has to be a claim that's presented to the government?               And all that (c) does is tell you what a claim is.          So that, even if it's not a claim against the government but just a claim against a subcontractor, that still can be the basis for liability so long as it's presented to the government.             Does the other side concede that point, that you have to prove loss to the government?    I don't think they do, do they?             I don't think they do.              You could say that the missed funds which are in the hands of subcontract -- of contractors, harms the government, even though it doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed. That would work, without saying that the government has lost any money.              Well, suppose the government gives money for building schools, okay, to a State and a fraudulent claim is submitted as -- in connection with the construction of the school. The government has been cheated in that the money it gave for a school is not going to the school; some of it is going into the hands of the fraudulent contractor.             I understand that, but that's a different point.             I am talking now about the point of whether the government itself has to suffer any harm other than the fact that the money it gave was not used for the purpose for which it gave it.                 That alone, it seems to me, could be harm.              Am I correct in this that without the claim definition, the statute would not cover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to the contractor which is known to be passed on to the government ultimately?              Without that definition, the claim would be made against the contractor, not against the government.              And, therefore, wouldn't be a claim.
07-219 +++$+++                And we thought so in Prentice.              Well, I had not understood you to concede that -- that the land rule was different from the maritime rule.        I gather that in many States it's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to be.              Which was a land case.                You would say one of those factors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?                Even if it is not pre-emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors that you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose.
07-290 +++$+++               I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a -- as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State- managed.                   But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons -- that was the way militias were destroyed. The two clauses go together beautifully:                 Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.              Blackstone thought it was important.   Blackstone thought it was important.                    He thought the right of self-defense was inherent, and the framers were devoted to Blackstone.                     Joseph Story, the first commentator on the Constitution and a member of this Court, thought it was a personal guarantee.              They got nothing at all, not everything they wanted.             They got nothing at all. So long as it was up to the Federal Government to regulate the militia and to assure that they were armed, the Federal Government could, could disband the State militias.              So what, what was the function served by the Second Amendment as far as the militia is concerned?              And as I recall the legislation against Scottish highlanders and against -- against Roman Catholics did use the term -- forbade them to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking about their joining militias; they were talking about whether they could have arms.              Mr. Dellinger, let's come back to your description of the opinion below as allowing armor-piercing bullets and machine guns.                 I didn't read it that way.         I thought the opinion below said it had to be the kind of weapon that was common for the people --              -- that is common for the people to have.   And I don't know -- I don't know that a lot of people have machine guns or armor-piercing bullets.   I think that's quite unusual.                But having a pistol is not unusual.              How many people in the country?              I don't think it's common.              Or a law on the carrying of concealed weapons, which would include pistols, of course.  doesn't it?              Doesn't "well regulated" mean "well trained"?        It doesn't mean -- it doesn't mean "massively regulated."         It means "well trained."              You turn on, you turn on the lamp next to your bed so you can -- you can turn the knob at 3-22-95, and so somebody --              You mean you can't have any more arms than you would need to take with you to the militia?   You can't have a -- you can't have a -- you know, a turkey gun and a duck gun and a 30.06 and a 270 and -- you know, different -- different hunting guns for different --              You can't do that?      I mean a State could say you don't --              You can have to have a 12 gauge and that's it.
07-308 +++$+++                  Mr. Jay, is the government running with the fox and chasing with the hounds?                 You want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no, no, no, that doesn't apply.              Why?     Why shouldn't the two go pari passu, as we say?                 Oh, yes, they make the same mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same, the same mistake.                 I mean, it's either, you know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the other pot.    And both sides want to -- want to split them up, but why don't they go together?               Right.          I thought you were making a second argument, that even if they were entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be entitled to interest.        You don't make that claim?               I see.               Right.               Right.          Right.   Okay.              Plus interest.              Wait what very narrow exception?    It didn't apply the exception.                Don't the two go together? If you could bring an injunction action, surely you don't have to pay the tax.              Well, that's what she is saying.   She is saying that those conditions exist here. That this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore, she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through the tax provisions.              Well, you could say the same about the tax on oleomargarine.                   It is a perfectly valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts.                   And here the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.
07-312 +++$+++               I mean, you could say this was Congress, right?              That's what the whole case is about.              He wants a reason why that might be.   Do you know many instances in which Congress has set up a system in which you cannot determine whether a State tax is valid or invalid until some future event at an indeterminate time which may be three years later?    Is that customary --              -- for someone not to know whether the tax is payable or not for sure until three years later?              Isn't that a good reason?              What harm is done?       Could you tell us in just a few words, what's the harm? That's what Justice Breyer's concerned about.              What about the solvency of the person who has tentatively been declared exempt from your tax; so, therefore, you can't go get him right away?   This is not the ordinary citizen.               This is somebody who is on the edge of bankruptcy.                You would normally want to get your money out of him as soon as possible before he squanders what is left, right?              And would it -- would it not happen with some frequency that, even though you could have collected the tax three years earlier, by the time it turns out for sure that there's never going to be a Chapter 11 confirmation --              Mr. Makar, you were going to address, I take it, the assumption that Justice Breyer has asked you to make, which is that the language here is ambiguous.             And your position is, I take it, that "confirmed" means "confirmed"?              Sometimes don't they want the transfer to be effective whether or not there is a later confirmation?      I thought that that was the assumption here:   That some of these transfers they want to be effective whether or not a confirmation occurs later.              Is that spelled out somewhere in the -- is its text somewhere in these materials?               Not the full, not the full section, though.               Just little snippets of it.
07-320 +++$+++               Mr. Herman, can the government respond to political speech?                  The government can have a position on smoking cigarettes, it can have a position on a lot of things, but can it have a position on whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party should win the next election?              Isn't that a distinction here?                Do we usually evaluate restrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of whether the chill that was imposed by the government was actually effective in stifling the right?                If the person goes ahead and speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the government was chilling his speech nonetheless?                Isn't that's what's going on here?              The government says that in fact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the $350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents. Something like -- I don't know, 14-2 or something like that in the last election, is that right?             Yes.             Of course, that could mean that the millionaires have already been elected and are now pulling up the ladder after them. (Laughter.)             Right.               But that wouldn't level the playing field.    I mean, the other side, the millionaire, won't take the public funding and he'll spend his millions and whoever gets the public funding -- or are you saying the public funding should match whatever the other side pays?               Well then --              Do you think that's a valid constitutional objective, to level the playing field?              Do you think we should trust our incumbent senators and representatives to level the playing field for us? (Laughter.)             What we're talking about in leveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the amount of speech that each side has, to make sure that each side has the same amount of speech.                 Is that -- is that what's going on here?             Are we -- are we talking wealthy people here?      What's the average price of a home in the United States?      I think it's a good deal above $350,000, isn't it?             It doesn't limit those restrictions on your candidate.             It simply makes the imposition of the restrictions uneven.              Doesn't it prohibit -- I thought it prohibited him from raising funds in the amount from as wealthy donors as his opponent can now go to?   Don't those limits on contributions continue to apply to him?             Who is more incorruptible than the millionaire, right?             The ultimate incorruptible. (Laughter.)              Well, it advises the other side that they should get ready to raise more money.              Well -- I mean if you say all of the rest of the statute is okay, that's certainly reasonable.   If you're going to let the guy go above the limits that would otherwise apply, it's useful to let him know in advance so he can start, you know, beating the bushes, right?
07-330 +++$+++               I could have sworn that I've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which the claim is that the sentence was increased on remand vindictively.   I'm sure I've seen cert petitions like that.    And you're telling me that the assertion of vindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be increased on remand? But all you have is a court of appeals case for that.              Who asked this question? We're going to get a totally different case here. (Laughter.)              I thought it was sort of an important part of your case that the cross-appeal rule was an established rule.           You now knowledge that it's not an established rule?                 Not just jurisdictional but well-established.                 But you say it is a well-established at least rule of practice.              And what's to be said against that?   How many courts of appeals do not apply that?              Well, they --              They didn't apply it under this statute.   I am saying, apart from this statute, what courts of appeals in other cases deny the existence of a cross-appeal rule?                Ms. Maynard --              It seems to me many of these horribles really exist, however we decide this case.   I don't know that anybody says that if there is not a firm rule requiring the -- a cross-appeal, I don't know that anybody says that the court of appeals must search the record and correct any errors below.              The statute talks about the general --              The general cross-appeal rule --              It happens all the time, that there's an error in the judgment which the court of appeals does not -- does not reach because there's no court -- no cross-appeal.          It's totally unexceptionable.              (E) also contradicts (f) --              -- (2)(A) and (B) because in some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the appeal has been brought by the wrong party.
07-343 +++$+++                Our jurisprudence just requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be -- to particularly heinous crimes.            And one could say that rape is in and of itself particularly heinous, rape of a child of 12 or under.               How would you describe a particularly heinous rape of a child under 12?            What would make it particularly heinous?              Suppose -- suppose the State says that all recidivist rapists of children under 12 will suffer the death penalty.                  Does it have to narrow that class further?            I mean, the need for narrowing depends upon how narrow the class is described in the first place.       Right?              I mean, if the law says you have to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other factors that you just mentioned, if the law said that, would you come in and say, "Oh, no, you can't just give everybody who commits that crime the death penalty"? You have to narrow the class.              That's a --              Two people who think even the death penalty for murder is no good, they're going to form the majority of people who consider whether a lawful death penalty can be imposed for rape.              I think at least in those circumstances, you have to discount the people who would not allow the death penalty under any circumstances for any crime.              He --              He -- he is not considering the issue that is before the Court.                     The issue before the Court is whether -- whether a permissible death penalty can be imposed for this crime.                     These parties say there's no such thing as a permissible death penalty.   I mean, it would be -- if that wrinkle isn't there, we should iron it in pretty quickly. (Laughter.)              That's nice.              I say that's nice.         We're in effect -- in effect prohibiting the people from changing their mind.              -- about what justify's the death penalty.              Didn't we say in Atkins that it's the trend that counts; it's not the number?              The trend -- the trendy expression hoist by your own petard:                      The trend here is clearly in the direction of permitting more and more -- of more and more States permitting the capital punishment for this crime.              They don't even have to say "the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court." They can pass a law that seems to contradict a prior opinion of ours; can't they?              Abraham Lincoln should they could, anyway.              Do you really think that if this Court held in the present case that the death penalty can be imposed for the rape of a child under 12, do you really think that the trend would not continue, that there would not be more States to enact such a penalty?              That there would be more?              That it would not.                Isn't there a Federal treason statute?                And that doesn't require murder; does it?                Do you think that's unconstitutional?                Do you think treason is worse than child rape?              Well -- What would they be?              How do you do view recidivism?    I mean, I assume even if you don't oppose the death penalty, you're going to get a good number of years, right?    So you are going to be 40 years in prison, come out and do it again?                  I don't think so.              I mean, it is an unrealistic condition that you have raped a 12-year -- a child twice.    The first time you do it and are convicted of it, you'll be sent up for long enough that you won't have the chance to do it a second time.              I don't understand the difference.   If you have a general murder law with an aggravating factor of killing of a law officer, okay, the jury can decide from the whole category of killings of law officers who gets the death penalty and who doesn't.   Why is that any different from what happens when you have a statute that makes it a capital offense to kill a law officer, without any further qualification? It's exactly the same result.                  It goes to the jury.   This person killed a law officer.                 It is up to you whether you give him the death penalty or not.
07-371 +++$+++               You don't need a reason to file a FOIA request anyway, right?                   Just the naked curiosity justifies your obtaining the documents, right? I mean this is a lawsuit that does not require a reason except I want the documents.              You've got them.            I'm entitled to them.              I mean somebody could have walked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit, right?              Although it is not really just your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?               What are your clear rules? Give me -- set it forth clearly, what you think it takes.   Number one, do -- do you have to know you're going to be bound at the time the first suit is brought? That isn't the requirement, is it?               Right.               So what are your tests? How many?   Five?   Four?       It is not a totality of the circumstances, test though, right?               You have some criteria. What are they?               Agency?              Okay.              Okay.              A representative that they agreed to?              As in a class action, where they have the -- the ability to bow out if they want, right?              Yes.     I mean, and the individual's ability to withdraw from the class, if he doesn't want to be bound by this suit, right?              That is crucial.              Can we?              Even if company is represented by the same law firm?               I think you'd also say that if the company paid for the suit.                  The company just -- "I don't want to be in control of it.                     I don't want you to sue in my name, but I think this is a good thing for you to do, so I'll pay for it."               No.    No.      The company says, "absolutely I do not want you to represent me."                    That is in -- in a letter.      Okay? So it's clear that the law firm is not representing the company, but the company thinks that it's a good idea to have this lawsuit and yeah, I'll bankroll it.              I think you've got to give that one away. (Laughter.)
07-411 +++$+++               We've said that regulation does include regulation by adjudication for purposes of -- of Federal pre-emption laws.               Why would it -- why would it be different for -- for Indian law.              Yes, I understand, but I'm just talking about the first one now.                    You say it is not -- it is not regulation, right, under the first?                   And that's -- that's the only point I'm addressing.                   Why should regulation through a process of adjudication not be considered regulation for purposes of our Indian law where -- whereas, we have made clear in several cases that it does constitute regulation for purposes of Federal pre-emption under statutes that pre-empt state regulation?              We could have said the same thing about the Congress.            Congress just said -- just said "regulation," and we interpreted that term to include common-law adjudication.                 You don't really mean "actual consent" by "actual consent," right? (Laughter.)                 Maybe you should use a different term, like "implicit consent," maybe. (Laughter.)              Oh, so one of your answers to an earlier question suggests the same point that you now seem to be making, although I don't -- I don't recall it from your brief.   Apparently you think that it would be different if this antidiscrimination law of the tribe had been set forth in a tribal ordinance.                Is that right?   Would you say your client could have been held to it if it had been written, rather than simply a -- a portion of tribal common law?              That's not what I asked. That's not what I asked.         I asked whether you would acknowledge that your client could be bound if it had been written.               Well, that doesn't make any difference.    We shouldn't place any weight on the fact that this was a common-law regulation, rather than regulation by a statute or ordinance.                     You can't have it both ways.    It either makes a difference or it doesn't make a difference.               But you just told me it didn't.               You just told me that even if it were written down, you would still need what you think is express consent.              Can a State distinguish when it grants a corporation status between non- Indian and Indian corporations.  transaction the obtaining of back-up liability on the part of the individual Indians who, who owned the corporation?    Didn't they guarantee the loan?              No, but it does give the whole thing a decided flavor of dealing with, with Indians on the reservation.               You're dealing with a corporation that, that's majority owned or entirely owned.   Is it majority or entirely? I believe it is certainly 51  There is a question about                 And then you get guarantees from, on reservation Indians.               It smells like dealing with Indians on the reservation to me.                    Of course, this certainty that you're -- that you're asking, your client could have obtained that certainly by inserting a choice of law provision providing that any disputes would be resolved somewhere else, couldn't it?                 In the absence of that, why should we bend over backwards to give something that has the smell of dealing with the Indians any other name? Your clients can fully protect themselves by a choice of forum provision.                Is it a contract claim?                Is it a contract claim? Was -- was -- was the claim a claim for discrimination in contracting so that it was part of the contract claim.                It's a freestanding tort action, is that what it was?
07-440 +++$+++               Or the incarceration. Would your case be different if after the magistration the -- your client was free to go?                  The court said, you know, this is what you've been arrested for and charged with by the policeman who brought you in; we'll -- you know, good-bye.   Whereas in this case, he was required to make bail.   Suppose he hadn't been required to make bail, supposing he was free to go?               Right.               So Texas -- assuming we agree with that, Texas made one of two possible constitutional violations.           Either it was unconstitutional for Texas to require him to make bail, or it was unconstitutional for Texas not to provide him with an attorney.    Why should -- why should we find that the latter was the problem rather than the former?               Well, there certainly is if you're not charged.      I think it's a very strong point in your favor that he was required to make bail, because I don't think you can hold somebody without charging him, just say, you know --               The fact -- the fact that he was held suggests that he was charged with something.             Sure.             So maybe, maybe Texas was wrong about that, that it shouldn't have required bail. Maybe that was what was unconstitutional, rather than its failure to provide counsel.             Why doesn't it solve your -- the problem that you're obviously wrestling with, if -- if we simply said there is a right to counsel, but it doesn't attach until there's a significant stage of the prosecution which then follows?             I mean, if you have some proceeding afterwards, yes, then you do need a lawyer, but the mere fact that you've been brought to the courthouse and made bail and let go does not require 500 counsel to be provided.           Only -- only when there is some later proceeding, which is an essential part of the prosecution, must you have counsel.             Why wouldn't that solve the problem?               That's fine, but --               But you only need counsel at significant phases.               Right.                Yes, but it's so wrapped up with how we decide this case.               I mean, if I think that counsel has to be appointed right away for -- for Justice Breyer's 500 demonstrators, I'm going to give a different answer to the first question.                    But if I know that counsel doesn't have to be appointed until the prosecution proceeds to some significant phase where an attorney would be -- would be really helpful, then -- then I can -- I can be quite more sympathetic to your -- to your argument.             And that stage would arise immediately as soon as the magistration was completed, right?             He'd have to have counsel appointed immediately --   -- to advise him whether to ask for this hearing or not.              Do you know any other case in which we've held that it's a critical stage of the proceeding where nothing has happened, but something could have happened if the defendant had asked for it?              I don't -- I find it hard to describe that as a critical stage of the proceeding.              When the trial occurs, it is a critical stage.              I have no doubt.              But you're claiming that his decision of whether to ask for that or not is a critical stage.   And I just don't know any precedent for saying that something that hasn't happened is a critical stage.
07-455 +++$+++                 General, could -- could Congress pass a law that said if you wear a wristwatch during the commission of any crime, you get another 10 years?              Surely it depends on what the felony is.     If the felony is the filing of a dishonest tax return and -- and you have a can of gasoline with you when you mail the letter, it seems to me quite as absurd as saying wearing a wristwatch in the course of a felony.        That's what troubles me about this. I'm -- I'm tempted to -- I think everybody is tempted to distort the "during" to -- to mean something else, simply because the consequences of performing a completely lawful act wearing a wristwatch, carrying explosives -- given the broad definition of explosives, I guess it would include having -- having some cartridges, explosive cartridges?              That's perfectly lawful, and you get another 10 years for it just because you're -- you're mailing a letter to the IRS at the same time.              This isn't a very good case.    If you wanted to bring a really absurd case, you could have picked a better one than this, because there really is something of a connection.                 And maybe gunpowder doesn't include the little bit that's in a cartridge either. You think it does?              Well, it was going to be - it was going to be inaccurate as to one or the other of one or two.    If you said "during," that would be -- that would be inaccurate as to one. And "in" is accurate as to one but inaccurate as to two.        I guess they should have said "in or during" or "in which." They should have added "fire," too, right? (Laughter.)
07-463 +++$+++               In a particular case, I suppose.             I don't understand -- I don't understand your response.             If -- if someone has an interest in -- in stopping a particular action that would be governed by -- by -- by this general regulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is -- is threatened proximately by that action, that person could certainly bring an action seeking to stop the action on the ground that this regulation is invalid.             And that would govern that particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent for invalidating the regulation in other cases.               I -- presumably other courts would -- would similarly say that the regulation is invalid.             Suppose the statute says anybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of the due -- due process clause.              Would that statute be valid?             The Article III requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?              Mr. Kneedler, I don't even agree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice provision confers standing, because it's close to the APA.              Close -- close to the FOIA. In FOIA, an individual citizen demands a certain document which the law entitles that person to.               This is a concrete deprivation --              Of something concrete. And --              Well, I thought you were doing it.    And I certainly don't --
07-474 +++$+++              Rational-basis review normally doesn't inquire into the actual motive, for example, of the State legislators who impose such a tax or impose such a restriction.              We simply ask:   Could there have been a rational basis for this?               Now, are you willing to abide by that test?             Listen to what I'm saying. Not whether you could decide that, given all of the facts of this case, the criticism of the co- workers and all of that, whether it is conceivable to say that this was done on a rational basis.              That isn't the rational-basis test. It's just sitting back without these factual inquiries, just as we don't inquire factually into why the State legislature acted, just asking:                  Could there have been a rational basis for the dismissal of this employee?                No, no, no, no.        I'm not working with this person; he is not going to affect my efficiency.     He's under somebody below me but I just don't like him.              Right.              Right.               Suppose the government -- suppose the government comes in and says, we don't want to take a position as to -- as to what the reason was; it could have been any one of the following seven -- you know, the wheat market collapsed; she came in late five days; some of the jobs she did she didn't do well; she dressed inappropriately on the job; her co-workers didn't like they are -- you know.                 And -- can the government do that?             How far -- does it have to pick a reason?    You're --          you're --             So long as there is conceivable reason, the court would grant summary judgment?                That's what I thought, too.             All those facts are true facts, but the government isn't claiming that any one of them was the reason.        It just says here are the conceivable reasons why -- why she might have been fired.   We really don't know which one it was.             But here are seven perfectly conceivable reasons.                What do you mean, to negate it?   To negate it as the actual reason is what you mean.                But the government is not purporting that -- to say that it's the actual reason.                The government is saying had she been dismissed for this reason, and we really don't know whether that was the reason or not, but had she been dismissed for this reason it would have been rational.             Well, I didn't understand your position to be that, but that -- -
07-499 +++$+++               Mr. Pincus, could I ask about your description of the Government's position as saying that it's purely objective and that there's no mental factor whatever.        Is it clear that the Government not only would not take into account coercion, the fact that it was done under coercion, but also would not take into account the fact that the individual even knew?              -- that he was persecuting somebody?               Has the Government taken that position here in in this case?               I guess I should ask the Government?               I could think that that's wrong without thinking that you also have to take into account whether there was coercion.               Well, but it's very -- - it's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require knowledge of the act.        Indeed, if the person doesn't know what he's doing, you know, he may be insane, but he's not a criminal.        Whereas, it is not automatically clear that the fact that the -- you killed somebody because otherwise they'd break your arm would -- would be a justification.       I mean, it seems to me the two are quite separable.               So you wouldn't balance. So, you know, gas these 20,000 people or we will kill you?               You gas the 20,000 people, right, and that's okay?              Well, to give the devil his due, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's every court of appeals that -- that has looked at this provision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it means, right?              So you are faulting the BIA for -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable interpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the resolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an ambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to address the matter has said?              Why do you think that's clear?     What's -- what's the text you rely on?              Do I have it in front of me?              Well, gee.           I mean, if this is central to your case, don't you think I ought to have the language in front of me somewhere?              Wonderful.                It's a "see" citation, right?                Well, I mean, you know, it's just not a flat citation which would say that governs.   It means this is a relevant case that you should look to.   And you don't deny that it's relevant. You try to distinguish it, but it's certainly something you should consider, no?                And that's all you have to say that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?                That's not very much.               It's a "see" cite again, isn't it?               All right, that's good.             You say "Citing Matter of Laipenieks"?             Citing it.         It says "citing Matter of Laipenieks."        Do you know if they cited it just flatly or was it a "see" cite?             Do you want to bet?                What -- what happens to him?   Does he -- does he stay here or --                Until some other country other than the one that will persecute him will receive him, is that -- is that it?                Oh, really?             Okay.              Your unprovable question upon unprovable question.            I mean, to say that one question is really, really hard to figure out is no justification for laying on another one.               Mr. Pincus, I didn't -- I didn't get the bottom line of your exchange with Justice Breyer.   Is it your position that there -- there has to be some -- some coercion defense, but it's up to the Attorney General to say what it is?                 I mean, he could say only if he were threatened with death?               And only if you were threatened with torture, not if it was threatened that your family would be exterminated?                 Where do you get that discretion in the -- in the statute?               Any old coercion defense he can do -- make.   So long as there is some coercion defense, that's all you want.             Some coercion defense?             You said -- you never get past step one of Chevron.          You say that this statute is clear.   You say it's not ambiguous.             I think it's pretty ambiguous if, you know, there is some old coercion defense, but we don't really know what it is.             It seems to me if you are going to say step one is clear, there has to be some coercion defense that -- you know, of -- of a substantial nature that the Attorney General cannot fritter away.              Mr. Pincus, who has the burden of proof?    Assume there is an exception for coercion.              The applicant would.          And -- and what -- how do you decide?                 There's not going to be any evidence on the other side, I assume.                    The applicant's going to say I was coerced.                    And -- and the only basis for rejecting is -- a sufficient basis is just, I -- "I don't believe you"?             And do they have shifty eyes? (Laughter.)

07-513 +++$+++                 I thought negligence is irrelevant here.   I think if the police department was wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing for shear causality, not for negligence.                If negligence made the difference then we'd have to go into these factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.                I know you were answering his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's consistent with your argument here.              You've injected the word "negligence."              Alone, but --                -- there is dual causality.              It isn't a matter of simple negligence.             Just so I have your theory firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's part?    The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong. It wasn't negligence.       You would still say that that is police error, and you would say that that counts against the admission of --                 Exactly.         You give something, you get something.               If you adopt a negligence theory, the --                 -- the noose is not as wide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder to calculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiry into whether there's police negligence or not.                 A much easier rule, was there a warrant or not?          If there wasn't, end of the -- end of the inquiry.             Isn't there probable cause here?             He thought he had a warrant; he had probable cause to arrest.                It doesn't seem to make sense, though.   Why should we separate the two?                If the policeman is mistaken about whether he saw this guy picking somebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that case, the search is -- the product of the search is admitted.   In the other case he's mistaken about whether there was a warrant.        Why do you want to draw a line between those two?             That's crucial to your case --             -- really, that you -- that the police will not keep good records unless -- unless we let the criminals go.             And that's the theory of the exclusionary rule as --             -- as has been expressed in writings in some of our prior cases.                    Things have changed a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary rule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much more professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to think that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that you propose, police -- police departments will just willy-nilly not keep track of warrants.                    I -- I just don't think that's true.        That's not professional policing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the -- the severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this area at this date seems to me excessive.              You don't think that --             I agree with that.    If -- to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide that today is just unrealistic.               We have to decide today whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial investigation of the procedures of the police.              And a major -- major trial.                 That's your bottom line position, it has to be a negligent error?                 What is the position you're arguing for?                 You want to adopt a rule that's only when it's a negligent error?               May I ask one question, Chief.               Your -- your comment seems to assume that these warrants just lie there and the police only use them incidentally.                  I have always assumed that when a warrant is out, part of the job of the police is to -- is to arrest the person.                   Isn't that the case?
07-526 +++$+++                Of course, I suppose if the phrase "now under the jurisdiction of the United States" did not have any clear meaning when the statute was enacted, it -- it wouldn't have any clear meaning for the future, either.     So you don't -- you don't solve that problem by reading "now" to mean "then," right?             Yes.      I'm saying it doesn't help if you do what the Government suggests.                    That doesn't give any clearer content to the meaning of being under Federal jurisdiction.             It is still going to have to be worked out somehow.           The question is whether you work it out and apply it as of the time of the statute or work it out and apply it time by time.              Where -- where were you reading from?    I --              That's what's causing me confusion there.    You're talking about -- I wish we would just use the statutory numbers, but do what you like.              Thank you.              What section are we talking about -- 19?    Or are we talking about some other number?                I assume that you think "Indian" modifies "organized band" and "pueblo" as well.
07-542 +++$+++                  That's not a long time. What -- what was the situation when the Fourth Amendment was adopted?   Do you know?          If you stopped Thomas Jefferson's carriage to arrest Thomas Jefferson and you pulled him off to the side of the road, could you -- could you then go and search his carriage? I'm struck by the fact that there is no effort in your brief whatever to take this thing back any more than 27 years.         Now, you know, it could -- it could well be that it has always been considered reasonable to search the person and to search the conveyance from which the person has been taken. If that's the case, I could say, gee, it's always been considered reasonable, end of case.              But -- but you -- you give me nothing to hang my hat on.              That's a reasonable rule. What isn't a reasonable rule is to say at the same premises as long as the officer is there and the officer is at risk.    I mean that is just -- it's just silly. It's -- it's simply not the case.                 And -- and if you bring that forward as the justification for this rule, I'm going to say, you know, get rid of it.              Realistically, he is not at risk.   The guy is handcuffed in the police cruiser, and so I want to go and search his car.                      What -- what risk to the officer is being avoided?                I wouldn't.       I'll bet you that in most of those cases the -- the felon got out the other -- other door of the car while the policeman was searching the vehicle. (Laughter.)              Once you -- once you eliminate the -- the need to show that the officer's safety was threatened why -- why would you limit the search just to the passenger compartment of the vehicle? Why don't you let him search the trunk, too?             I know -- I know you're not but it just doesn't make sense to me to -- to abandon the requirement that the -- that the officer's safety be threatened and yet to say oh, but he can only search the -- the passenger compartment.                 If indeed there is reduced expectation of privacy for the automobile, you arrest somebody you can search the automobile; what's wrong with that?               You've arrested this guy for -- for reckless driving.             He was going 25 miles over the speed limit, okay?        And you're going to search his car for evidence?     Of what?               You're going to allow the search nonetheless.      Let's assume he is handcuffed in the back, so officer safety is not at issue; but you say we want to be able to search a car for evidence. Evidence of what?               I understand that.               You have to link -- if you're going to use that rationale you have to link the reason for the arrest with the likelihood that there would be any evidence found in the car that would support the arrest.               Oh, so -- so you, you avowedly say that once you arrest somebody you can rummage around for evidence of a different crime, right?              Why -- why can they impound it?     Suppose they stop and he pulls over to the side of the street where there is parking, all-night parking. What authority would they have to drag that car away?              He says, "Let me lock my car."     You know, "I park it on the street all the time. It's a lousy car any way.            Nobody wants to steal it." (Laughter.)                I can see some situations where -- where, for public safety or other reasons, you have to remove the car from where it is, and I guess the best thing to do is to drag it off to the police impoundment yard.    But in other situations, I -- you speak so blithely of impoundment as though -- as though that's an automatic remedy.             I just don't know that it is.              So -- a fine-line rule.      I mean -- and you can instruct all the police officers in your department, when you arrest somebody, have them stand right near the car while you search it.                Okay? Make sure that he's near enough that, you know, he's a threat to your safety. (Laughter.)              That's certainly a bright-line rule.

07-5439 +++$+++                  Who would be a medical doctor -- and medical doctors, according to the Code of Ethics of the American Medical Association, can't participate.              Mr. Verrilli, this is an execution, not surgery.        The other side contends that you need to monitor the depth of the unconsciousness. When you expect to bring the person back and do not want harm to occur to the person.            But they assert that to know whether the person is unconscious or not all it takes is a slap in the face and shaking the person.              That's their contention.              With regard to the trial court's failure to make findings about the availability of people to do this and about the possibility of -- practical possibility of more effective and less painful drugs, was that a failure to ignore evidence that you produced?             Did you introduce evidence to show that indeed medically trained personnel were readily available to do the things you say?             I'm very reluctant to send it back to the trial court so we can have a nationwide cessation of all executions while the trial court finishes its work and then it goes to another appeal to the State supreme court and ultimately, well, it could take years.             You wouldn't want that to happen.              We have been discussing this as though that is a constitutional requirement. Where does that come from, that you must find the method of execution that causes the least pain?                   We have approved electrocution, we have approved death by firing squad.     I expect both of those have more possibilities of painful death than the protocol here.                   Where does this come from that in the, in the execution of a person who has been convicted of killing people we must choose the least painful method possible?                   Is that somewhere in our Constitution.              No, I don't agree with that.     The concern was with torture, which is the intentional infliction of pain.               Now, these States, the three-quarters of the States that have the death penalty, all except one of whom use this method of execution, they haven't set out to inflict pain.               To the contrary, they have introduced it presumably because they, indeed, think it's a more humane way, although not one that is free of all risk.                No --                Unnecessary and wanton, unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.                Well, then, you're changing your position. You said -- you just said earlier that we didn't have to find the least painful way.                But if you're not using the least painful way, you are inflicting unnecessary pain, aren't you?              Can you rectify that?              Hanging certainly would, right?              Is that a hard question? Is that a hard question, whether hanging would, whether you had experts who understood the dropweight, you know, that was enough that it would break the neck?             Hanging's no good.   What about electrocution?             It has to be, it has to be painless?                I would think you'd have to show it's unusual, not painless.                 I mean, cruel and unusual is what we're talking about.                      There's no painless requirement in there.                Where does this unnecessary pain requirement come from?                Dictum in our cases, right?                Dictum in our cases.
07-544 +++$+++                Do that again, will you?             Why do you say in light of the jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity that the jury had found this?             I mean "in light of the jury finding," why don't you just drop that.
07-552 +++$+++              Say it again?        What is the common ground?               Well then, this is not really a very significant case, is it?                    Because I presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of the rewards.    So it's no big deal, I mean, really.             Go ahead, I'm sorry.             What if all of the claimants assign their claims to something called an agglomeration trust and the -- the person who's bringing suit here brings it as a trustee?                  He has no interest in it personally and he is compensated the same way, the same way this agglomerator is compensated.                 He has no personal interest.      He could sue, couldn't he?               So once again, it's no big deal.   I mean --             What do you do about -- about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of Federal regulation?      They're just sort of out of luck? Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they can take their claims to?           I mean, this is a fluke that there happens to be this Federal agency they could have gone to.    Certainly our principles of standing should not depend upon that fluke, should it?

07-581 +++$+++                Is this included in the question presented anyway?               Does it have anything to do with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?               The Second Circuit simply said you could not deprive an individual of the right to a court trial.               And the issue is whether -- now, if -- if we held that you can require the individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we could confront the question of whether, if the union is in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal, that would invalidate it. But it has nothing to do with the question presented:     Is an arbitration clause which clearly and unmistakably waives the union member's right to a judicial forum enforceable.                I -- I hate to get into this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the union and -- and the employees.               What does that mean?          Does that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?              Mr. Salvatore, I -- I didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this particular contract, which is not an issue of national importance.    Why -- why must we decide the case here? Could we not simply decide that the Second Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of Title VII claims?    Why couldn't we just decide that? And then if there is any issue of whether such concession to the union deprives an individual of even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?             And the Second Circuit could look into all of these details.             And inquire into the New York law that you're talking about now and that I don't recall being in any of the briefing.               Mr. Salvatore, would you -- would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on his own?               He has got an arbitration instead of a lawsuit.               Article 7, no.               You said Article 6.       Isn't it Article 7, if it's on 47a?               Oh, I see.       Okay, so you are on 6.   I got you.              Where does that appear?              Where does that appear?
07-582 +++$+++               Did it -- did it reconsider its policy?    In the first order, I would -- I would have gathered that it had, but its second order said basically, we've never had a policy that single use of these expletives is okay.           Which is it?         Are they changing their policy or not?              The latest order, the one that's up here, says that all of the statements to that effect in the past were simply staff statements and that the Commission had never held to that effect before.               But I think it rewrote that in its last order, and I think it even explained away the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as categorical as it might appear.               Which is, indeed, why it's used.              Although they don't, I gather.              Because they find it offensive, I gather.              They had a 5-second delay at the time these things occurred, didn't they?              And it wasn't -- it wasn't that they weren't fast enough or something?              Right, right.                It depends on whom you are dealing with, right?              This Paris Hilton incident was scripted.     The use of the indecent word was almost invited, wasn't it?              But it was sort of an invitation.     I mean, before she was introduced, said, "Now we're on live television, you have to watch your mouth", or something like that.              It was a setup.              But you didn't fine them, anyway, did you?              Oh, it's funny.   I mean, bawdy jokes are okay if they are really good. (Laughter.)
07-588 +++$+++                "Reduce" in any event is -- is not -- is not the same as what you are arguing.                You are arguing reduce to the maximum extent reasonably possible.   The word "reduce" alone doesn't convey that. The word "reduce" would just mean, you know, if you -- if you knock it down any amount, you have reduced it. But you are saying "minimize" requires more than that.     It means reducing it to the maximum extent reasonably possible.        Isn't that what you are saying?              Just to reduce.              I didn't understand that to be your position.     You -- you don't think that "minimize" even means that you reduce it to the maximum extent reasonably possible?              You think any reduction constitutes minimizing?                 Yes.                 Let me say it again and you tell me whether you agree.            I had thought that what you meant the meaning of "minimize" was is that you reduce the -- the harm to the maximum extent reasonably possible, not merely that you reduce it to some extent.                 Of course, "reasonable" includes everything.              Ms. Mahoney, I -- before you go any further.       I am not clear.                 I -- I did not understand that for 30 years the only test has been a grossly disproportionate test.                You seem to accept that as true.              Wholly disproportionate?              And you're -- you're happy with that?              Okay.       You think they can use a wholly disproportionate?              And you'd be happy if they continued to do that, but you wouldn't be particularly happy if we prescribed that as the only available test? Is that the --

Can you testify to your own knowledge that this is what the analysis showed?             And he would have to say, no, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can tell you he was a very reliable person.                   How would that -- I don't understand how that would work.               Mr. Fisher, how many States do things the way -- the way you would have them done? I mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice laws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the information?              Well, they bring in witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but --                 Mr. Fisher, I am interested in the history since that's what the Court held in Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause is not what we would like it to be, but what it historically was when it was enshrined in the Constitution.   As a matter of history, was there a business records exception, not from the hearsay rule but from the Confrontation Clause?                 Why isn't that a business records exception?      I don't --               Oh, wait.        You say it's -- that business records would often or usually not be testimonial?               Would have been nontestimonial.   So they'd come in on that basis, not because they were business records?               For the indictment, not -- not as -- not as independent evidence in the prosecution.   It would form the basis for the indictment, as I understand what the history is.            It would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death was thus and so.              Have you found cases where the material was admitted as a public record despite the fact that it was a public record created for prosecution?              Well --                 So you say they could introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that this was cocaine?

I'm not following you.            Is there -- is there an exception to the hearsay rule so long as the hearsay is brought in, in rebuttal?                    Is there a rebuttal exception to the hearsay rule?             He is thinking about Cambridge and not England. (Laughter.)             Do any of them have anything to do with the Confrontation Clause?               And besides which, the question that Justice Breyer was asking was already answered in Crawford; wasn't it?               A case from which he dissented.   But we did say that the meaning of the Confrontation Clause is the meaning it bore when the people adopted it.             Instead of intent, the dying declaration rule required knowledge by the declarant that the declarant was about to die.             Right?             And the evidence of truthfulness was apparently that the person was about to enter the next world.              And most of us don't lie at that particular moment.         Whereas, in the Confrontation Clause situation you have a totally different situation.              You jumped off in Crawford, I thought.              I had thought that the common law rule is that you have to have rendered the -- intentionally rendered the witness unavailable with regard to the particular trial that's before the court. Not rendering the witness unavailable for some other litigation.              Do you know of any case where it was some other litigation that --              I didn't think so.

They would have wanted the whole thing to be a dead letter.           There are a lot of people who didn't like this statute because it was a gun control statute.               Well, if it's a compromise with the people who wanted no statute at all and you come out with a statute that covers one-third of the States anyway, I mean that's, you know -- that's the deal.               How do we know -- how do we know that?              But it also substituted this structure that we are -- that we are discussing today.   Didn't that come in at the same time?              So, why -- why say it's only the former provision that was the compromise and not the addition of this later language?                You can't.       I mean, you have the "that," and the "that" applies to both (i) and (ii), and this is part of (ii).                I think you've got to either say "that committed" or -- or put in an "is" -- "that is committed."        It just doesn't parse, and that lack of parsing is much worse than the one that you -- you point to in the other side's reading.                    Yes, it's not usual to talk about committing a use of force, but it happens sometimes.      It's -- it's not the most elegant language, but there are many examples of such usage that have been brought forth by the other side and by some of the amici.   So they have something that -- it's not elegant, but people have spoken that way.                    Nobody speaks the way you want us to speak:            "An offense that committed by a person or an offense that" -- "committed by a current or former..."         Nobody talks that way.              Nobody.              I wouldn't agree with that. You'd still have the "that" up above.                  You would have to have a hard return and take out the "that" or -- or that (A) is a misdemeanor, "has as an element" and then a hard return, and you have to add "and is committed." You still have to add language besides the hard return.                 I want to follow up on Justice Kennedy's inquiry about the rule of lenity. Don't you think the rule of lenity is particularly important when you're dealing with conduct that is not malum in se?   I mean, to say that, well, we are not going to apply the rule of lenity to a statute that posits an increased sentence for kneecapping or for some violent conduct, the person knows he shouldn't be doing that stuff anyway.      But this imposes a -- a -- a penalty for conduct that no one would think is unlawful. This fellow is -- wasn't it his father's gun he was taking to sell at a gun show or something?                 Well, he could have ten, couldn't he?                 Why?                 But -- but for this language that you say makes his owning of a firearm unlawful, it wouldn't be unlawful at all, would it?                 He would have no reason to think he couldn't have a firearm.               Should be.       Is that right?               A misdemeanor -- a misdemeanor offense.      And -- and -- and he should suspect that because he committed a misdemeanor, he cannot have a firearm?               I don't think anybody would assume that.   Indeed, there are some who assume that you -- you cannot prevent the owning of a firearm for a mere misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony.               Make it clear. Make it clear, so that when -- when his lawyer pleads to the offense, he doesn't have to read in a little (iii) where there is not a little (iii).              And he -- well, you did not plead guilty or you are not accused of the offense of using violence against a family member.     You're just -- just accused of -- of using violence, a misdemeanor.              What -- a serious violent offense.    Are there -- is there felony assault and battery?              And this was misdemeanor assault and battery, wasn't it?              So it's not that serious an offense.    That's why we call it a misdemeanor.              Then he should have been charged with a felony, but he wasn't.                    He was charged with a misdemeanor.              I think -- I think that people are governed by the law that is passed, not by the law that Congress intended to pass.              So, really, if a lawyer reading this would not think that it applied, I don't care what Congress intended.            If -- if the law doesn't say that, the person is not governed by it.                 You think a person could be governed by it despite the fact that it doesn't say that because Congress intended it?              Of course.                You have to add words.    It is unavoidable.   To come to your reading, you must add words to the statute.        To adopt the reading of the other side on the other hand, you need not add a single word. You just have to resign yourself to the -- to the usage that is unusual but not unheard of, that a particular use was committed.      And the other side gives a number of examples, as does the brief by -- by linguists, a number of examples where that appears. So it's an unusual usage but not an unheard of usage.   They don't have to add a single word or a single hard break in the text.                You have to, to get to your construction.              You'd would have to put a "that" --              You'd have to put a "that" at the beginning of (ii) as well, wouldn't you?                 It makes it easier to identify it.     You don't have to go back and look to see whether this particular assault conviction was an assault on a family member or not.                   It's there on the face of the indictment.          Pretty important, it seems to me.
07-610 +++$+++               But, of course, they wouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some kind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme.                  They -- they contribute to the national union, and in exchange the national union defends their interest just as it defends the interest of other unions.                  You didn't address that -- that pooling argument.              It doesn't seem to me fair to call it "subsidizing" if, in fact, that's what's going on.              I don't know because that wasn't inquired into by the court below.                 I guess we really -- we really don't know, do we, when -- whether the local union can make any demands upon the -- upon the national union for -- for litigation defense?                  Yes, but it's based on the experience of the whole -- the whole cohort of insureds.                  And the Chief Justice's question says:     Can a -- can a -- a local that is certainly on the basis of past experience not going to need this insurance nearly as much as other locals -- can it enter into an insurance arrangement with other locals to buy the insurance for all of the locals even though it knows that it won't benefit very much from that insurance policy?               That was -- he was trying to help you.               You should have said, yes, Chief Justice. (Laughter.)             Well, it isn't banned. It's just -- just -- you know, you don't force the nonunion member who indeed may be anti-union to pay for it.   And he doesn't want to subsidize the union librarian.   He doesn't like unions here.               He doesn't like unions in Hawaii.       And for the government to force him to -- to support the union is, I thought, part of the reasoning behind --

07-636 +++$+++               We know what's going to happen on remand, though, don't we?                     Doesn't the Fifth Circuit already have case law on -- on that question?             Sorry.           Does this appear somewhere in the materials?            It's always helpful.             That's not your point.          It would seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an exception to the assignment or alienation.             And your point is this has been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO exception.   There is nothing in here that violates anything in the statute.             So whether he could have done a QDRO is in your view irrelevant.                 Your basic case is the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on assignment or alienation, that provision has no application here, there has been no assignment or alienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.              Was this waiver only part of the divorce degree?         Do you agree with your friend on that point?              That's not separate and apart from the divorce decree.
07-665 +++$+++                I suppose it depends on what the Government speech consists of, what it is the Government is saying about the Ten Commandments.            If the Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word of God that's one thing, and if the Government is saying the Ten Commandments are an important part of our national heritage, that's something else.               I think 38 is the cut-off point.                Is this a challenge to the Ten Commandments monument?                I thought this case did not involve an Establishment Clause challenge.                       Why are we --             It goes to the same thing, doesn't it?    I mean, whether it's the Government stating the message or whether it's the Government creating a limited public forum for the presentation of only those messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the same thing, doesn't it?              It seems to me the Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of other things that in -- in many States people are free to do.    The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?              It's not only absolutely entitled, it has to do so.          It -- it has no choice, does it?             You can't run a museum if you have to accept everything, right?               Well, maybe they can't do it in museums, either.        I mean, yes, we've been doing this for a couple of hundred years, but maybe we've been wrong all along and maybe the Government can't run museums.   It's possible, right?              It's a brave new world.
07-689 +++$+++                 Do you have racially polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote as 40 percent?    I mean, you say, we apply the normal Gingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover is fairly high.              But you still think that we can confidently say this is racially polarized?              Well, we -- what you propose is going to inject courts into the drawing of districts much more frequently than they -- than they already are injected.     The reality is that one of the factors -- you mentioned contiguousness and county lines and so forth, but one of the factors that legislators always take into account is incumbent protection and the incumbent is always going to rather be in an 80 percent district than in a so-called 40 percent coalition district. I think you are unrealistic to expect State legislatures to draw districts that way, where everybody will have a chance.      The whole object of it is that nobody will have a chance, just the incumbents.                That's what is going on.               Well, that's fine, but you just can't wave a magic wand.              It -- Congress also intended primarily to leave it up to the legislatures under guidelines, to be sure.              And when you have a choice of one 80 percent or two or even three 40 percent, it's clear to me what the legislature is going to -- going to choose.              We will be injected into this very political game much more frequently than we now are.   I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles thing as simply a self-protection prescription for the courts, where you can look, you can be clear and say, you know, close enough for government work. But if you want us to figure out whether there could be three districts, two districts instead of just one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing the whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into the courts.    And that is -- that is not something that I, for one, favor.

07-77 +++$+++               Are there any other district cases that require preclearance except those that redistrict the, the State?              There is a law to be cleared if you -- if you assume that the existence of a law to be cleared occurs before that law has been tested in the courts.    In the hypothetical we've been discussing, just as in this case, there was a State law and if you assume the State law is valid before it's gone through the judicial clearance process, there is a State law change when the clearance process results in striking down the law.         I don't -- it seems to me that the two situations are pretty parallel.              On the other hand, I can also see the attorney general saying:                     Why should I preclear it?    It hasn't even been determined to be law in Alabama yet. Does the Justice Department preclear stuff that is -- that is in the midst of litigation?              Where they are doing the districting or --              Do you know of any cases where -- where a piece of State legislation has been in the middle of litigation where the Justice Department has precleared it?              It seems like an exercise in futility.              It would have been able to be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory intent, certainly.
07-772 +++$+++                Why just a homicide?         What was -- what was the indictment here?                    What was he tried for?               Why wouldn't assault with a deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you have to know that it was first degree murder or second degree murder?   I don't know how you get from the text of the Washington statute that all you have to know is that it was a homicide?               But -- but he wasn't prosecuted for homicide.         I mean, the crimes are much more specific --               -- first degree murder, second degree murder.               How does that appear from the statute?   If I read the statute, I would have thought that you have to have knowledge that he was -- would negligent homicide suffice?             Where is that?           Is that in the charge to the jury?             It's not in the court's charges.              Did -- hadn't other Washington State courts made a similar error in their interpretation of the Washington statutes?              And the same -- and hadn't the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard the same way and using "In for a dime, in for a dollar" to mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if you were in for beating him up that's enough for holding you liable for homicide?              Including this one in an earlier case.              The only reason I raise it is, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on the point.     It asked for further instructions three times on this precise point, what did -- did he have to know.   And all the trial judge did was say read, you know, read my instructions, which essentially recited the statute.     And what all of what you've just acknowledged shows is that reading the statute doesn't help a whole lot.     It doesn't clarify.                   It doesn't, it doesn't correct any misimpression that the prosecutor could have created.               Let's look at -- where is that?               In the white?                It's not objectively unreasonable to say the opposite.
07-773 +++$+++                 I have the same problem that Justice Souter does, especially since section 2 refers to equity.     It says they will be irrevocable and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. Obviously this -- this section was meant to apply to equitable actions.               You wouldn't dismiss them in law for a -- a ground that only existed in equity?                I don't know.          When it says they are enforceable and makes an exception only for grounds that enable revocation in law or in equity, I would -- I would think that the general command was meant to apply to both law and equity.             Say that again.        I didn't follow that.              Why -- why wouldn't 1332 require complete diversity and require the court to assure itself of that anyway?              I thought you said it did have a look through, an automatic look through, itself.              I see.           I see.   You are -- you are -- you are limiting it to the amount.
07-8521 +++$+++                Why not?        Why not?               That would be a subsequent -- a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings, his retrial in state courts.              Excuse me.       I have lost you.   Where is the "appropriate"?               I don't see any "appropriate."              It says "shall represent the defendant throughout every subsequent" --                 every subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings.             Yes, right.             Right.             Well, it says "and all" --             Right.             "Other appropriate," but as far as what's covered by the first clause is concerned, "appropriate" doesn't apply to that.             "Represent throughout every subsequent stage of available proceedings, including pretrial, trial, sentencing, motions for a new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari.                     There is no "appropriate" in any of that.             "And shall also represent" -- and "other appropriate motions and procedures," but that doesn't cover the earlier stuff.              Well, but -- but, you know, it mentions trial proceedings, trial, motion for a new trial, appeals, applications for writ of certiorari. And then, in the next clause it just says "and all available post-conviction process."                     Now, you would acknowledge that going back to exhaust claims that had not been exhausted before the State courts would be post-conviction process or not?              "Subsequent stage" does not apply to this clause.      I'm reading the clause "and all available post- conviction process."              Okay.              Right.             Ms. Chavis, what do you do about(a)(1)?    That also is not limited by its terms --             -- to federal prisoners. Would you argue that it says "in every criminal action, which defendant is charged with a crime that is punishable by death."             So even in the original State trial, he is entitled to a federal defendant; is that right?             Why not?         It doesn't limit it to Federal trials.             Right.           It says he "shall be entitled to the appointment of one or more attorneys."             So what?          I mean, it still is -- is unqualified.             And part of your argument, not your only argument but a large part of your argument, is since it is unqualified in (E), the last clause, it has to include State.                Well, you could say the same about (a)(1).                Oh, but -- but --                So -- so if the State doesn't provide counsel, the Federal Government will provide it, and the States can recede from their obligation to provide counsel, right.                Why?      Why?   So long as he has counsel, we don't care who pays for it.              What -- what about expert services?   I think most States don't provide for that.              The Federal Government will provide expert -- compensation for the use of experts when the States won't?              Under (a)(1)?              Sure.              It seems -- it seems to me, counsel, that the mere fact that it doesn't mention "federal" explicitly is -- is not a very strong argument unless you are going to take the position that even (a)(1) applies to federal and state.                      And -- and really what you are -- the only strong strength to your bow is that it says "executive or other clemency."                      And -- and there -- there seems to be no federal clemency except executive clemency, I guess.              I guess. Can Congress declare something that has been a crime no longer a crime and set the guy loose?                        I don't know.     Is that "clemency"?              It says here the President can.     It doesn't say Congress can't.                   Does it say Congress can't?             And we know that they read this text carefully before they voted for it, right?             We don't know any of that.             These are all assumptions. That's all.

07-869 +++$+++                Are there -- are there in counties some charitable drives that occur annually and that permit employees to donate to those charities through deductions from their wages?                 And would they presumably be covered by this?         United Fund drives, so-called, my -- my recollection is that usually the contributions to that simply come out of -- are deducted from the wages. And if they existed in the counties, presumably they would have been covered.             But we don't know if they would.                 Oh, it's only political activities?                 I see.          Well, none of those would allow that --               Would -- would they include contributions to an organization that makes contributions to political parties --               -- such as a right-to work-organization?              Does the State give some particular favor to unions?           I mean, does it allow -- what -- what is the situation?             Can you be forced to contribute to the union even though you're not a union member?              But unions do have a special prerogative which -- which no other organizations, as far as you're aware, have in the State, which is to have money deducted from people's payrolls?               Yes.      The point of my question is it doesn't seem to be terribly discriminatory if indeed the only organizations in the State that are given the right, whether by Federal or State law, to deduct, private organizations, given the right to deduct from the salary a municipal or private employer pays.    It doesn't seem to me particularly discriminatory to say that, moreover, in making those deductions, no part of it will be given for political activities.    I mean you're only addressing a narrow class, but it's a narrow class that has a special benefit.             What about a Hatch Act? Does -- does -- does the State allow State employees to engage in political activity?             I don't know -- I don't know what that means.             That's interesting.    Why not?
07-901 +++$+++               Well, but it -- it, by reason of the unusual law at issue here -- -I think it's unusual, I don't -- I'm unaware of any other State that has one -- the sentences -- the defendant has an entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently unless a certain additional fact exists and that additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than by the jury.    So that if you take seriously what -- what we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the defendant is entitled must be found by the jury -- if you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't apply here.              How many others?   Do you know?              You know, this fact can -- can turn out to be the most significant fact for the defendant.    I mean, it could lengthen his sentence enormously.    It's more important than many of the other facts that we leave to the jury.              But you could say the same about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power where at least there is an entitlement by law to a certain lower sentence.         And there we said you can't leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that trigger that law exist or not.             So I gather from your argument that you would -- you would be taking the other side and you would be saying that it has to go to the jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?               There it's attached to a particular crime.    Do you really think that we should have a different result in that case from this one?               You could say the same thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up to them and they considered a wide array of facts.               So what?   We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by law and say they can't do more than this, once you do that, that fact has to be found by the jury.           And that's what's going on here.               But you could say the same in Apprendi.    It was a judicial determination how much of a sentence you were going to get from ten years to life.    It wasn't up to the jury.               It was up to the judge.               And yet when you constrain the judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than 20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a gun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be left to the judge.      It's a matter of law, and the facts must be found by the jury.            And I don't see any difference here.     I mean in both cases it was traditionally done by judges.             It's a lot easier to limit it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to sentences.
07-9712 +++$+++                Well, I used to teach contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a breach of contract.     That would have been a breach on his part. Now, the government has conceded the breach of the plea agreement.       I don't -- I can't understand why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it. Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of deciding what the -- what the remedy is?                Ignore the reality that there was a breach?               I mean, you know, if the government said, we will ask the court to sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know, suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the government really supposed to have to go before the judge and say, "Your Honor, this man is really remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower end"? It seems to me it's a basic principle of contract law that a party to a contract cannot take action which makes it impracticable for the other side to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what your client did.   The government couldn't practicably go in and make that argument when he had demonstrated himself to be an unremorseful criminal.               Oh.                Where is that in the record, do you know offhand?               Where the plea agreement is?                Thank you.             Why wouldn't it suffice to give your client everything that he was entitled to if the case were remanded to a different judge and the government were required to go before that judge and make the commitment that it undertook in the plea agreement?             Why wouldn't that be a perfectly satisfactory remedy?               Well, you have to say that. But let's assume I don't agree with that.                 Let's assume I agree with Justice Alito that his entry into it was voluntary and all that's happened is that one of the commitments on the part of one of the parties has not been complied with.       Why isn't it an adequate remedy for that problem to send it back to a new judge and have the government come before that judge and make the same commitment it was supposed to under the agreement?                It doesn't -- it doesn't retroactively render the government's promise a misrepresentation.      Every time a -- a party to a contract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been guilty of fraud.     "Misrepresentation" would mean the government had no intention of complying with it when -- when it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert that was the case, do you?               So you are saying, if -- if I understand you correctly, that even if at the trial your client's lawyer had objected and had -- and had said, Your Honor, the government promised to recommend, you know, a lower thing, what the trial judge would have to have said was, the plea agreement is invalid.               And the trial judge could not say, oh, yes, the government has to make that recommendation. You are -- you are saying it is invalidated by the mere fact of the government's not having done it, right?               So no objection need to be made or can be made, right?               Wow.              Well, that's inconsistent with the answer you gave me.              The answer you gave me is that automatically the guilty plea is washed out -- automatically.              It is automatically washed out?              And, therefore, he cannot -- he cannot sit around and wait to see what happens.   What happens is -- whatever happens, it's invalid.   The plea agreement is no good.               You have to have a new trial.              Voidable -- then your answer to me would be different.                It's -- it's not void. It's voidable, so that he can play dog in the manger and wait and see what happens, and then if it's in interest that -- in his interest to void it, he does.                  If it's in his interest not to void it, he doesn't.
07-984 +++$+++                 Fill material trumps effluent, in other words?                But it can contain it so long as it is -- as it -- as it is not transitory.                I mean, isn't it arguable that the best place for -- for really toxic stuff is at the bottom of a lake so long as it stays there and is not carried --             Is nontoxic covered by 402?             Nontoxic is covered by 402. You -- you can violate the effluent guidelines by -- by pouring into the waters of the United States even nontoxic materials, isn't that right?             And under 404 it'S only toxic.             And that's the big difference.
07-9995 +++$+++                You don't need a good reason for a peremptory challenge.               That's the whole fun of a peremptory challenge:        You don't need a good reason.              Exactly.         And for some reason, I just think this person is not going to vote for me.    I don't know why.         I just don't think so.             I don't want this person sitting on the jury.                    That's all the reason you need.              Well, if you --             The authority to challenge preemptory challenge rights entirely?                    Right?             So this is not a hard question.             And, therefore, it could take the much lesser step of allowing the trial judge, if he has any suspicion that a peremptory-challenge right is being used in violation of Batson, to disallow it.   What is wrong with that.
08-1008 +++$+++             Have they applied it? If I recall your brief correctly, you say that the New York courts have applied it to causes of action arising under other State laws.       Is that right?            Can t a statute be both? Can a statute both establish a substantive limitation and also establish a rule of procedure for New York courts?   Why can't a statute say, New York courts will not entertain any action, including those arising under foreign law, that are class actions seeking penalties? And also, no New York State cause of action which seeks a penalty can be sued on in a -- in a collaborative action?   Couldn't you do both in the same?            Well, you are begging the question.     It's a general instruction.          But can't -- can't the instruction be interpreted to be both?
08-103 +++$+++              Can -- can I ask you, one of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to have gone to the Copyright Office first.              And therefore would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come back to the court.             I don't --               No, I didn't -- I didn't think it related to the third sentence.               I -- I thought she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and then rebring the suit.       If it was jurisdictional, just a jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit could then proceed.               You would be --               You'd be able to come back anyway?               That's what I thought.               That's what I thought you'd say.               Yeah.             And -- and --             Well, you shouldn't use loose language, especially when it's the same loose language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by all the courts of appeals and all the district courts.             For years and years.              But how -- how would we get to hold what -- what you say is the law?               It seems, to me, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we agree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this case -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the district court. That's the end of the case, and so why do we have to engage in the further discussion, well, ordinarily, the district court must raise it on its own and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily -- you know, the appellate court should. Why do we have to get into that?              Which means we shouldn't. (Laughter.)             Well, that's normal, but not invariable.             Unless it is plain error.             It's pretty plain that the things haven't been registered.              I mean, right?   And it's pretty plain that if they hadn't been registered, the district court should not have proceeded with the case.   So I don't know why it wouldn't normally be plain error in -- in the court of appeals.
08-1065 +++$+++                 You're not answering the question clearly.     Are both the prosecutor, in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable? Can't you answer that?         Yes or no.                Good.      That's what I thought your answer was.                Well, she's more concerned about the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be treated just like a police officer?                In the case?             And how do you get the policeman who has fabricated the evidence?             What -- what does that prove?   What does that prove?           I don't understand why you bring that up because it shows that the fact that there aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second Circuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second Circuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your opponent suggests. Is that --             Yes.       That's -- that's just what I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied that way, there would have been more than 17 cases in the Second Circuit.             Okay.
08-108 +++$+++               You think he knowingly stole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones, would that be the parallel?              You left out the "knowingly."    Once you put in "knowingly" --                 You are making it very hard for me to vote with you, I must say.                      I thought you had a pretty good -- a pretty good case.                      But if you are going to say somebody who has five identity cards, faces of individuals, presumably they are real individuals --               I thought that was the hypothetical.   Five different -- the person has five identity cards of real people, and -- and you don't know that he knows that its the identity cards of a real person, but he used it.               Yes.      Yes.               Of course.
08-1107 +++$+++                Well, why would we say that?   Just because it wins your case and it solves your problem?   I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is that "place" doesn't mean "State."               And to talk about the whole State of California as the principal place of doing business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would have said, the principal State in which business is done.               You don't want to throw away that good argument, do you? (Laughter.)             That means that its principal officers and their families have to move.             That's the biggest disincentive it seems to me.
08-1119 +++$+++             Wait.        It doesn't mean is it likely.   "In contemplation of" means that the reason you are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy.                 You don't see any causal connection in that phrase?            Well, that's true.        That may be true enough.      But -- but the act must be taken because you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.            That's a different question.             What if you leave "abusive" out.     Let's accept your point that "abusive" is not there and the government is reading in out of nowhere. What's -- what's the matter with the statute then?               It just prohibits giving advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody incur more debt.     What's unlawful about that?               But that's not in contemplation of bankruptcy.               If the only reason the lawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this -- that this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no good.   Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why it's -- why it's unconstitutional.            So it's a stupid law.            Exactly.         And that's why it's a stupid law.            Now, where is the prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution? (Laughter.)              It's only lawyers who are protected against vague criminal statutes?              So then -- so then there is no reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just to make it constitutional.             That's fine.       If you -- if you are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a fine argument.    But don't -- don't bring in the fact that, well then, moreover, if it's applied to attorneys, it's unconstitutional, because if it's applied to anybody it's unconstitutional according to your argument.             This is a proposal for a commercial transaction, right?               You are trying to get a consumer to hire you.        And the First Amendment standards for proposals for commercial transactions have always been more -- more lenient than other First Amendment contexts. We -- we -- we regulate the content of advertising all the time.            I don't know --            I don't read the hypothetical that you have given as coming within the statute.   I think what -- what it means:              Incurred debt to pay an attorney, I don't think it means debt to the attorney.   You are not worried about the attorney cheating himself.               Making himself an additional creditor.       That's ridiculous.               What it talks about is inducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody else to pay the attorney.           You know, and that seems to be perfectly reasonable.               That's right.               Why -- why would you worry about the attorney, you know, hurting himself?               It makes no sense.
08-1134 +++$+++              Only -- only -- only if the bankruptcy court disregards the law.               I mean, it's -- it's clear that the bankruptcy court should not have done what it did here.       The only issue is, it having made that mistake, can it -- can it subsequently be -- be undone in the manner that's -- that's sought here? They haven't reduced three to two.              The three -- the three remain three.             The bankruptcy court should not do this.          There are a lot of commas. What comma are you referring to?            Where is (c)?   You have been talking about 523(c).          I can't find it in any of the materials.            Why don't you put it in an appendix if it's going to be part of your case? I ve got to search through your brief for it? What page in your brief?           Don't bankruptcy courts read the law?           So you ve got to assume that every bankruptcy court is going to violate the provisions of the statute.          Why, of course, they are supposed to police --
08-1175 +++$+++             Are the Florida Supreme Court elected?     Are they elected judges?            Are they elected judges, the Florida Supreme Court?          How -- how long is their term?    There s a retention election when?          Every 4 years.        And they'd have to run for their retention election on the ticket that "We've expanded Miranda for Florida purposes," right?           It told them entitled to confer with counsel before answering questions, right?           Wasn't that -- wasn't that the warning given -- given in this case?              You are entitled to consult counsel before answering questions?          Well, once we say this is properly given, my goodness, here's -- here's an instruction approved specifically by this Court.           I mean, I think they should use that, don't you? I mean, the other one they are going to have to guess about, but this one is approved in a case involving Florida by this Court.           So you -- it's pretty attractive to use that one.          Well, you have to say it's okay.     You are arguing that it's perfectly okay, so why do you hesitate when you are asked, you know, could the State go back to doing it?          You should say, yes, of course, they -- they might; we don't think it's likely, but they might, and if they did, it's perfectly okay. Isn't that your position?          It's not your position?            And the Constitution requires it, right?            Well, Miranda supposedly says the Constitution requires this warning, and if the warning must be in a standard form that everybody uses, the Constitution must require a standard form that everybody uses.
08-1191 +++$+++                I guess there's also the issue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not a jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case. I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't get to the merits.                But you are not -- you are not pressing that?              Well, it seems to me that isn't worth anything, right?            I mean, that's -- they haven't conducted a rulemaking or anything.              They just -- just appeared in court.             Right.             Except that they don't come out on your side anyway, do they?             We are only talking about this case.    I mean -              We are only talking about this case, right?     If we send it back, we send it back to have this case decided and they'd come out against you in this case.              So what could -- and that is going to change the Second Circuit's view of things, the fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it has been reconfirmed, although on different grounds, by -- by the government?              There is no reason to send it back.             Well, but -- but Australia says:   Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two. And we should be able to decide that and we don't want it decided by a foreign court. You are talking about a misrepresentation, if there was one in this case, made in Australia to Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide that issue; and here you are dragging the American courts into it.                Not to these plaintiffs.                You -- you have to join the misrepresentation to the plaintiff.                The only misrepresentation to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an Australian company.              But that -- that isn't the issue.   The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is: We want to determine whether there has been a misrepresentation or not.              We don't want the determination of whether there has been a misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation to be determined by an American court.
08-1198 +++$+++           But that's the same before courts.    That's no different.          I mean, yes, a court has to come to a decision, but so does an arbitrator.               And I really -- I really don't understand what it means to say that the contract does not cover it.              I mean, the -- the contract either requires it or does not require it. And if the contract is silent, either the court or the arbitrator has to decide what is the consequence of that silence, in light of the background, in light of -- of implied understandings.              Is the consequence of the -- of the silence that a class arbitration is permitted, or is the consequence of the silence that it is not? But those are the only answers.            The contract requires it or the contract doesn't require it. I don't know anything in between -- the contract is silent.    If the contract is silent, it's up to the court or the arbitrator to decide what that silence means.          Do I have to agree with Judge Posner on that?      I mean I -- I don't --          You would -- yes, you --          But --          Mr. Waxman, I hope you are going to have time to go through (a), (b), and (c) --          -- as you started to do.          Thank you.          Yes, I bet you were thinking you'd be able to.
08-1200 +++$+++                 I really don't think that the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the -- the word "intentional."         It seems to me it's the word "violation," because violation -- when it says the violation was intentional or unintentional, does "violation" mean the act that constitutes a violation of the law, or does "violation" mean the -- the fact of violating the law?             Does litigation constitute debt -- debt collection activity?             Okay.            If you ask and they answer.

How does 8(b)(3) read?            What is it in 8(b)(3) that would exclude this from the labor board's --
08-1224 +++$+++         What -- what -- what power conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure that sexual predators are not at large?          But you said no.        I mean, there is no constitutional power on the part of the Federal Government to protect society from sexual predators.     And, you know, once the Federal custody is at an end, it seems to me that's the only power you could be relying upon.        But it's fully reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State.        Well, but they don't fall through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies the State into which this prisoner is to be released: We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be sure that he doesn't harm society.              Because that's a State police function, it's none of our business.          General Kagan, you are relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right? You say:   But  necessary and proper  doesn't mean it s necessary and proper for the good of society.              It means it s necessary and proper for the execution of another power that the Federal Government is given by the Constitution. Now, why is this necessary for the execution of any Federal power?      The Federal criminal proceeding has terminated.     The individual is released.           You could say it's necessary for the good of society, but that's not what the Federal Government is charged with.   Why is it necessary to any function that the Federal Government is performing?              It has completed its performance of the function of incarcerating this individual until he has served his punishment.         General Kagan, I -- I find it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which this person is to be released, and they try to release him in the State where he -- he will in the future reside, and said, we are about to release this person in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious mental problems, and we think the State ought to consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult to believe that an elected governor or an elected attorney general would ignore that letter.        The governor is going to say that at the next election:           It would have cost too much to put this guy up.        You know, it costs $65,000.         I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed with -- with the argument --         I mean, this -- this is a recipe for the Federal Government taking over everything.         The States won't do it; therefore, we have to do it.              It has to be done, and therefore the Federal Government steps in and does it.          What about release from the Army?   Would that -- would that also -- if I want to turn this -- this person after discharge at -- you know, loose upon the society, could the Federal Government commit that person?          And I'm sure you didn't. (Laughter.)
08-1301 +++$+++           Well, it's not as though he was authorized to make something a crime which wasn't -- which wasn t a crime.          He was authorized to say you have to register.           You -- you re saying it has to take place not just after the offense, but after the obligation to register.          Which is what the statute says.            Well, assuming it does depend on the purpose of the statute, what would the purpose -- it wouldn't cover his transportation as an infant.     What does he have to be, 20 years old?          Or 15 years old?         Or is it 20 years before the offense or 25 years before the offense?               I guess we could make it up, couldn't we?          But which the States didn't enact.            And would that be the case after SORNA, that some States would have less extensive coverage than others?            Well, unless that could be the case, then I don't see what is achieved by -- why you worry about somebody moving to another State in order to evade the registration.            I mean, if the new State requires you to register just as much as the old one, what are you worried about?          Fail to register entirely?          Perhaps Congress --            It's conceivable also that Congress was -- was not confident that the States would be as active in prosecuting violations as the Federal Government would be.           But I was interested in the second, which mentioned other provisions in this -- in this very statute that -- that use the present tense.             You have to change the language "is required to register" to "has committed a" --
08-1314 +++$+++        Why would -- why would the Federal Government do that?     I mean, trust juries to supplement whatever -- whatever the Federal rules are, but not permit State agencies who -- who studied the matter with experts, to supplement what the Federal rules are?       Why does that make any sense, to just say, oh, you know, we -- we don't want the State mucking around in this area, but of course juries can do so?     Why does that make any sense?       I don't -- I don't doubt they made it.     I'm just curious as to why it could possibly have been?       Unless I -- unless lawyers bring suits before -- before juries, maybe.       Why is that different from Geier?     Didn't the automobile manufacturer in Geier - wasn't -- weren't the manufacturers similarly left to do, choose for themselves whether to have one type of constraint or another?       Your judgment here doesn't apply to the entire Mazda fleet, supposedly, right? Just to the car that caused harm to the plaintiff?       What about the next case? Let's assume a similar case.     Is that jury bound to come out the same way as to whether there should have been a shoulder constraint or not?       Geier came out against you. Why are you appealing to Geier?
08-1322 +++$+++              What authority does a court have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney?              Doesn't -- doesn't the government setoff depend upon who owns the money under State law?     I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership. And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does the government have to do the setoff?
08-1332 +++$+++                Mr. Richland, a little earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of --               Oh, the appendix to the petition.             I guess we don't decide our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of privacy from everybody.       I think -- I think those cases say that if you think it can be made public by anybody, you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy. So when the -- when the filthy-minded police chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not -- it s not offending your right of privacy.              You expected somebody else could listen in, if not him.             I think it is.               Is reasonable expectation of privacy a judge question or a jury question?             Excuse me.       You said they did get to the off-duty text messaging later?             You know, if they were on duty 24/7, there weren't any off-duty messages, were there? (Laughter.)             Suppose we find a right of privacy.   Is that the end of the case?                   I mean, wouldn't you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --             What s the government's position on the unreasonableness of the search?             Maybe an easier way, huh?                Mr. Richland, do you take any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?               Why?              Whoa, whoa.      I'm not sure you re doing the city a favor by making Arch the city's agent --              -- as opposed to an independent contractor who is doing business with the city.              You sure you want to live with that?             Oh, okay.
08-1341 +++$+++             You don't want us to do it, right?   You want us to remand it so that they can do it, right?   Is that --          Well -- well, but the same constitutional analysis includes step four, which is whether it undermines confidence in the result.              And don't you think that some constitutional violations more undermine confidence than others?          I suppose if the instruction told the jury in a criminal case that you can find the defendant guilty if you think it more likely than not that he committed the crime, that might be different, don't you think?
08-1371 +++$+++               But doesn't -- doesn't the one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with that you automatically comply with everything in the nondiscrimination clause?              Yes, but -- but the latter, the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that argument is not available to you.              Well, you should -- if that was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence of different treatment of other groups.                And there -- as I --                 There is none of that except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your brief, as I --                 I wish you would.          You are going to waste your whole time just discussing this stipulation point.       Let's assume -- let's assume that --   -- the latter is the policy.          You could have --          -- a student organization, I suppose, of that type.                   It wouldn't include many people.     But if there were such an organization, I assume that they would have that -- that belief required, right?            You say you --          Where -- where is the stipulation?             Wait a minute now.         A diversity --                 This -- this was not the policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that correct?                 It -- when they were refused participation in the -- in the student organization program, they were not told about the all-comers policy.              Anyway, as I understand your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature of CLS.     You would make the same argument of unconstitutionality with respect to the student Republican Club, wouldn't you?              Or --              This was the basis -- your distinction between status and belief was the basis for your saying that the original policy, whatever -- whatever we call it -- what is the name of it?              The written policy -- when it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was complied with by CLS because it would not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on the basis of belief.               CLS doesn't have any -- any belief that marriage is between a man and a woman?               No, no, no, no.               But he wants to marry --              Could you talk about -- I had understood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a policy of excluding people with homosexual disposition, but that it was only homosexual conduct.              Well, you -- but your complaint said otherwise.          Your -- your --              Oh, okay.
08-1394 +++$+++            What 49 and 50?    Of the government's brief?          So either this was too little or Martha Stewart was too much? (Laughter.)
08-1402 +++$+++         But we don't have any urns here. (Laughter.)         What's wrong --         Yes.      What's wrong with a rule?        With a rule?       With picking a number, rather than leaving it up to the courts of appeals or the district courts to use different numbers, different times?         I don't have to review all of these cases all the time.              Why don't we pick a number?     You want 10, right?         Yes --        That's why Las Vegas makes a profit, right? (Laughter.)         Do you have to be a -- a resident of the district in order to serve as a juror in the district court?         You have to be?         So then if this system were not in effect, and if Grand Rapids had to take white jurors from other counties as opposed to a larger percentage of black jurors from Grand Rapids, then you d have a claim in Grand Rapids, wouldn't you?         Well, you -- you d have a jury pool in Grand Rapids that wouldn't reflect the larger number of blacks in Grand Rapids.        So you re damned if you do and damned if you don't, right?
08-1423 +++$+++        Where do you get that in the text?     I mean, that's lovely, and you're saying that what Justice Breyer suggests makes perfect sense except for dictum and legislative history.     Does your position make any sense with regard to text?       Where?     Where is that limitation in the text?       I'm talking about your -       -- your limitation on exclusive rights abroad versus nonexclusive rights abroad.     Where can you possibly find that in the text?       Oh.     Well, that's the end of it for me.       You don't really mean - your position is that "lawfully made under this title" means that -- means "would have been lawfully made under this title if this title governed."     Isn't that basically what you are saying?       Okay.     But there is another provision of the statute -- I forget where it is - which says that in so many words.       "If this title had been applicable," right?     We say "applicable."     Much prettier.       And nothing in the text that supports your position.       You pulled out of the sky this distinction between having created exclusive rights abroad and having created nonexclusive rights abroad. Where does that come from?       You use -       I don't know why using -       Did the legislative history suggest what part of the text this -- this novel suggestion was based upon?       Let me write that down. (Laughter.)
08-1438 +++$+++        But did it use such language as "appropriate relief"?       I mean, that's the question.     Our cases say it has to be clear to the State when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to. And in these other cases I think it was clear.     I don't think it's clear with simply the word "appropriate relief."       Yeah, but -- but, I mean, that means either that the Federal Government -- that the State government is liable for damages just as municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to suit for damages just as the States are. I mean, that -- you don't know which way that cuts, do you?       Well, maybe let's talk about them, then.       Well, I can conceive of a case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA consists of a State statute that simply deprives the individual of his rights under RLUIPA. What State official would you -- would you sue?     It seems to me you couldn't sue the State legislature, so it would make sense to have an injunction against the State.       The word "appropriate" - the word "appropriate" would -- would suggest that to me.     If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I would read "appropriate relief" not to include monetary relief. And we have said -- the language from our cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in favor of the sovereign.     That's -- that's a high test.       And -- and although I might sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory text.       You -- you deny that it has to be unequivocal?       Was that contested in Barnes?       Was the liability for compensatory damages contested in Barnes?       Just punitive.     And there is a lot of discussion, the assumption that they were liable for compensatory, but it really wasn't litigated, was it?
08-1448 +++$+++        What's a deviant -- a deviant, violent video game?     As opposed to what?     A normal violent video game?       There are established norms of violence?       I mean, some of the Grimms' fairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)       Are they okay?     Are you going to ban them, too?       That same argument could have been made when movies first came out.     They could have said, oh, we've had violence in Grimms' fairy tales, but we've never had it, you know, live on the screen.     I mean, every time there's a new technology, you can make that argument.       Because the average minor is halfway between 0 and 18, is that 9 years old? (Laughter.)       I'm not concerned about the jury judging.     I'm concerned about the producer of the games who has to know what he has to do in order to comply with the law.     And you're telling me, well, a jury can -- of course, a jury can make up its mind, I'm sure.     But a law that has criminal penalties has to be clear.     And how is the manufacturer to know whether a particular violent game is covered or not?       I -- I really wouldn't know what to do as a manufacturer.       What about excessive glorification of drinking, movies that have too much drinking?     Does that have an effect on minors?     I suppose so. I -- I am not just concerned with the vagueness.     I am concerned with the vagueness, but I'm concerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.     And it was always understood that the freedom of speech did not include obscenity.     It has never been understood that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of violence. You're -- you're asking us to create a -- a whole new prohibition which the American people never - never ratified when they ratified the First Amendment. They knew there were -- you know, obscenity was -- was bad, but what's next after violence?     Drinking? Smoking?     Movies that show smoking can't be shown to children?     Does -- will that affect them?     Of course, I suppose it will. But is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit day by day to decide what else will be made an exception from the First Amendment?     Why -- why is this particular exception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested are not okay?       No, I want to know what James Madison thought about violence.     Was there any indication that anybody thought, when the First Amendment was adopted, that there -- there was an exception to it for -- for speech regarding violence? Anybody?       -- then -- then the State of California has no objection, right?     So long as the parent buys the thing, it's perfectly okay.       Yes.       So -- so that's basically all this is, is a -- a law to help parents; is that right?       You should consider creating such a thing.     You might call it the California office of censorship.     It would -- it would judge each of these videos one by one.     That would be very nice.       But do we let government pass upon -- you know, a board of censors?     I don't think so.       Excuse me.     If it has a plot, it has artistic value?     Is that going to be the test for artistic value?     Anything that has a plot?       Well -       Yes, one factor to be considered, sure.     But you're not telling us that, so long as it has a plot, it's okay?       You can't have artistic videos that involve maiming and cutting off heads and eviscerating people, and pouring gas, right?     So long as its artistic, it's okay.       Artistic for whom?     For a 5-year-old?     What a 5-year-old would appreciate as great art, is that going to be the test?       I don't know what she's talking about. (Laughter.)
08-1457 +++$+++                Is it your position that all of the actions of the board, including those taken by the regional offices and by the general counsel and by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the membership falls below three?              Well, it has a separate - a separate authorization for these three -- three-person adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?             Okay.        But that's a different argument from the argument you were starting off with, which, as I understood it, was once the membership of the board falls below the quorum of three, by reason of that, the three -- former three-member panels, of which there are now only two left, cannot act.     Is that your argument?              The membership of the board?             The membership of the board?              I understood that argument and I thought that was the only one you were making. But you are making a broader one, that it also happens whenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears.              So the regional offices can't function, of the NLRB?              Can the board pay salaries?             I'm really reluctant to rely upon this first argument that you are making, because I really don't know what it does to all of the functioning of the board.             I didn't understand that. Would you -- would you make that argument again?             Isn't there another difference?    Is it not the case that the decisions of these panels can be appealed to the full board?                  Are they automatically final?           Can the board not revise the decision of one of its panels?              You've got to tell me more than you believe it.       What is the case?             The adjudication is final.             There is no appeal to the full board?              That's -- that's a totally different argument from the one that relies upon the size of the board, right?              Even if the board were still properly constituted and had a full five members, if one of the three members to a -- a board should die, it would no longer be a three-member board and could no longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the delegation, right?             Well, you are shifting arguments.   You can't keep jumping back and forth between the two arguments.           The one is that the appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be three.   And when it falls below three it's only two. And I don't know that you have a response to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter argument, except -- except that it's a different statute.             If there is no legislative history, it could be true. (Laughter.)              What's the use of having a five-member board, then?          I really don't understand what -- what has been accomplished -              -- if you have a -- you are changing, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no good, we thought that's unfair.                We are going to make to five.   But then we allow the five to convert themselves to three for finally deciding all the cases.                  What - what has been accomplished?              Nothing.                What -- I am really confused now. Is it or is it not the case that the full board has the power to review a decision of one of these panels?   Before you said no; before you said it's final.                But that is -- that is my question, whether they -- they can review it before it is rendered, is that what you are saying?             They can review it before it is rendered.     Okay.              Excuse me.          Just the - just the representation cases, not the unfair labor practice cases?              Wouldn't the -              Yes, I understand.
08-146 +++$+++                Why do you say that section 2 -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says State law determines whether somebody not a party to the arbitration agreement can -- can enforce it.             Including enforceability by whom?               If he can do it under State law?
08-1470 +++$+++              Wait.       Do -- do we have any case that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long?             And that there can't be a waiver after 2 and a quarter hours?          And, therefore, there s no clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a quarter hours is too long.          Isn't that the name of the game here?           I don't understand how this person could just sit there for 2 hours and didn't want to be interrogated and doesn't say:               You know, I don't want to answer your questions.           He just sits there, and some questions he doesn't answer.             And he does make a few comments, anyway.           Why shouldn't we have a rule which simply says if you don't want to be interrogated, all you have to say is "I don't want to answer your questions"?          That's nice and clear, wouldn't be any problem at all.             That was never said here.   He, in fact, submitted to having these questions asked of him.          Why should the police have to play this game of, you know, an hour and a half, 2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 5 hours, 7 hours? Why don't we have just a clear rule:               You re read your rights; if you don't want to be questioned all you have to say is:     I don't want to be questioned.           Is there any difference between -- between waiving your right and a failure to assert your right?           Is every failure to assert a waiver?           What about before that? What is happening before that?         He hasn't asserted his right.   I mean, he hasn't said I --          He has done neither.          He has neither waived nor asserted.        Well, you re saying there -- there s a difference, I -- I assume, between not waiving and positively asserting your right not to be interrogated?        So, if -- if he had -- here he simply refused to sign the -- the Miranda form, right?             Which would have -- which would been the -- the waiver.              And -- and you re saying it's his later behavior that -- that showed that, in fact, he waived.   What if instead of just refusing to sign, he had said, I do not want to be interrogated?             Okay.             So -- so he has the right to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right.               If he neither asserts the right nor grants the waiver, the police can continue to try to obtain a statement from him?           Unless, I assume, that you -- you -- you acknowledge that if the interrogation had go on -- had gone on for so long that it had become coercive, then that -- that -- that last statement would not -- would not be a voluntary waiver.
08-1498 +++$+++           Well, it hasn't criminalized speech.     It has criminalized providing aid and assistance to these organizations.                 Most of that aid and assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of speech, but it happens to include speech as well.          I think that s quite different from a law that is directed explicitly at speech.            That's not the right -- that's not the right number three.                The right number three is you cannot advise and assist an organization that is seeking to overthrow the government.                That's what is at issue here, not --           -- not independently promoting the objectives of these terrorist organizations.                Your -- your clients are free to do that.           But when they assist the organization by providing advice, that's a different matter.            Okay.        When they provide a benefit, right?           Well, we -- we can cross that bridge when we come to it.         This is an as-applied challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice and assistance that your clients want to give.           It's not a New York Times editorial.           It depends on what "coordinating" means, doesn't it?             And we can determine that in the next case.           The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist organizations.    And the theory of the legislation is that when you aid any of their enterprises you re aiding the organization.        Hamas, for example, gained support among -- among the Palestinians by activities that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, all sorts of things.         But that is what fosters the terrorist organization and enables the terrorist activities.     Why isn't that a reasonable connection? Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot be separated from assistance to their terrorist activities.           I think it's very unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations with the Communist Party.         Those cases involved philosophy.     The Communist Party was -- was -- was more than a -- than an organization that -- that had some unlawful ends.     It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of extreme socialism.     And -- and many people subscribed to that philosophy. I don't think that Hamas or any of these terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical organization.           That may be, but people joined it for philosophical reasons.           They joined it for philosophical reasons.       These terrorist organizations have very practical objectives.            And the only reason for joining them or assisting them is to assist those practical objectives.           Well, in a way there is. What about -- what about aiding organizations that are acting criminally, killing innocent civilians, with regard to one of our allies?     And we re seeking to gain the assistance of these allies against those terrorists who aim their terrorism at us, and yet --           -- we -- we are supposed to allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations that are directing their violence against them?           Why isn't that a sufficiently serious reason for the government to do what it's done here?
08-1521 +++$+++           Mr. Gura, do you think it s at all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the Privileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it under our established law of substantive due process?          Is it easier to do it under privileges and immunities than it is under substantive due process?          No, no.      I'm not talking about whether -- whether the Slaughter-House Cases were right or wrong.     I'm saying, assuming we give, you know, the Privileges and Immunities Clause your definition, does that make it any easier to get the Second Amendment adopted with respect to the States?          And if the answer is no, why are you asking us to overrule 150, 140 years of prior law, when -- when you can reach your result under substantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you re bucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty -- (Laughter.)             Well, I mean, what you argue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure, but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence. Why do you want to undertake that burden instead of just arguing substantive due process?             Which, as much as I think it's wrong, I have -- even I have acquiesced in it. (Laughter.)          Well, what about rights rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people? Would -- would that do the job?          That happens to be the test we have used under substantive due process.          Yes.           There s a lot of statistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule saves lives or not, whether it results in the release of dangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but the confession can't be used.           We don't -- we don't resolve questions like that on the basis of statistics, do we?           Well, why would this one be resolved on the basis of statistics?             If there s a constitutional right, we find what the minimum constitutional right is, and everything above that is up to the States.          If they want to have, you know -- I think we mentioned in Heller concealed carry laws.     I mean, those are -- those are matters that we didn't decide in Heller.        And you may have a great deal of divergence from State to State.                 And on that, I suppose, you would do statistics, wouldn't you?                Or the legislature would.          For the judges.       For the judges.          But they would be for the legislatures.          I guess we -- I guess we have applied substantive due process with regard to the necessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with respect to the necessity of permitting abortion on demand.   We have not adopted a more rigid rule for the Federal Government than we have adopted for the States in either of those instances, have we?            It doesn't trouble you.
08-1529 +++$+++            Of course, I don't look to see what Congress intended.         I look to see what the statute says.   I don't know that we -- we -- we psychoanalyze the text of a statute on the basis of what the Congress at that time knew.           The text says what it says.            That s what it says.           Of course, we're -- you know, we re talking here as though Congress is a perpetual unchanging institution.             Why would it have done this for Public Health Service employees and not have done this for Bureau?         It wasn't the same Congress that passed those two Acts.          The one may have been a stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in one case. I don't see any reason why we have to philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.             Just as a matter of curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out of the same committee?       Or can one assume that the Public Health Service may have come out of one committee of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out of a third committee of Congress?
08-1553 +++$+++           Yes, but not --         Not every -- where you are dealing with -- with intermodal transportation, not every receiving -- not every rail carrier would be the receiving rail carrier.   I mean, this --          Your client is the first rail carrier to receive, right?          Excuse me.        What -- what are you referring to now?          But why -- why doesn't the (2), (a)(2), the delivering rail carrier -- if what you say is true, that should be the delivering rail carrier delivering in a -- in an adjacent foreign country.          That -- that limitation is strangely missing from (2).           Okay.        Wait a minute now.           The paragraphing you say is wrong?           Right.           So all -- you re saying that -- I think what you re saying is that all we have to use the statutory statement that nothing was meant to be changed or is to say, well, that paragraphing in 3 is just wrong, right?          The indentation.          I'm losing you.    73a?          Okay.
08-1555 +++$+++           Is head of state immunity implicit in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as well?           So why can't this be a -- a different body of common law?           No.    I mean, you re saying they -- they left head of state immunity to the common law, did not incorporate it in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.   Why -- why should I believe that they did not do the same for -- for agent of state immunity?           Can -- can you get to the text of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that you -- that you assert embraces this personal immunity?          -- that the suit is about. And you said where -- where the immunity exists is at 604, which says a foreign state shall be immune, but 1603 defines a foreign state, which -- which says that it includes an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state. And then it defines agency or instrumentality in a way which, it seems to me, does not include private individuals, but rather just artificial legal persons.           Well, I -- I would find it extraordinary that it would go out of its way to say that it includes the Department of Defense but would leave up in the air whether it includes the Secretary of Defense.   I mean, I -- I -- it seems to me much more likely that you would understand a foreign state to include the departments of -- of that state than that you would assume a foreign state to include individuals who happen to be officials of the state.             And there was no uncertainty about -- about individuals?          Well, entitled to it, or -- or able to obtain a letter from the State Department that would confer it upon them?          I mean -- well, I mean, prior to the FSIA, you -- you had to get it from the State Department, didn't you?            Even the state, for that matter?          And what -- what if the State Department came in and said no, no sovereign immunity here, what would the court do?            Would the court be bound by that?          So they didn't have to say yes, but if they said no, that -- it pretty much carried the day?          Well, you -- you don't assert that to be -- to be the law now, do you?           Has -- has that been carried forward --          -- under the FSIA?
08-1569 +++$+++           Well wait.       There s -- there s some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part as well.   There s sentencing stuff in (A).             You can't say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals with sentencing.          I mean, (A) says, "shall be sentenced to 5 years."        Or to 7 years, or to 10 years. So there s sentencing stuff in (A).          So does -- so does the language of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language:               if the firearm is brandished ;  if the firearm is discharged  -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying the firearm.     There has to be a conviction before those things apply.          So that makes (A) the same as (B).     And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A) are just sentencing elements, do you?            But still and all, if -- if Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital (B) should have been "if the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above," and then pick it up, "is," so forth. Right?   I mean, that would -- would be more precise.           Yes.           I guess I agree with you that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an element, too.            Right.            Isn't the old one in your brief, too, in your --            It's 3a of the government's brief.           All right.       Okay.           All right.             Well, except that with -- with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot say with respect to (B) that whether it's a short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally been a sentencing factor.         To the contrary, it was an element.             Let's -- let's talk about the guidelines.     Without the application of (B), the guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence, wouldn't they?             The guidelines -- do you think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that would be upheld?             Do you think it would be upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?          Where -- where is the life sentence maximum, by the way?           I -- you say this is a minimum.   It's just a mandatory minimum because the maximum is specified to be life.           Where is that specified?          Where -- where do you get the life maximum?   I -- I'm reading through, and there's -- it mentions nothing about life.          And if it mentions nothing about life, then these are not mandatory minimums.           To the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.          I don't find that implied at all.   I don't see why it's implied.          That's right.     That s --           That's her question.           I think what you are exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not impose a new sentence at all.             It just says there will be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be added to that sentence.       Then it says you ll add 7 years; you ll add 25 years; you ll add 30 years. Those are not mandatory minimums.           Those are add-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive crime to which (c)(1)(A) refers.             That way, the whole thing makes sense.           I ll amend what I said. It is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime referred to in (c)(1)(A) is above what is specified in -- in this statute.       But if it -- if it is below that, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for 15 years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, you get 30 years, that's an add-on.           I got it.           It's also on 3a of the government's brief.         Right.           Right.           It says  in addition to  at the end of (c)(1)(A):      Who, in furtherance  & possesses a firearm shall, in addition to the punishment provided for by such crime of violence, be sentenced to  5 years, 7 years, 10 years.        And then if the firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since your -- I assume that that introductory language "in addition to the punishment provided for" is implicit in (B).   It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit in (B).          Yes.          In addition to the term that s -- that exists for the substantive offense.          That's the right answer.            We have tall lawyers today. What is this, tall lawyer day? (Laughter.)
08-192 +++$+++                What is the purpose -- what is the purpose of saying who uses a communications facility?    Is that purely a jurisdictional hook?                Your argument sort of assumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that facilitating is the same as aiding and abetting.                If they meant aiding and abetting, it's a classic criminal law term, they could have said aiding and abetting. They didn't.   They used a different term, facilitating. Why should I think facilitating means aiding and abetting?              What -- this statute does not just apply to facilitating a drug offense.                   It applies to any of the felonies covered by subchapter 2 of the relevant chapter.         I agree, it seems a little strange to have what is a misdemeanor by a buyer converted into a -- into a felony just by use of the phone.   What other situations under other felony provisions would arise that create a similar oddity?                   Do you have any in mind?               I don't understand what you're saying.     The use of a phone may be more difficult?
08-205 +++$+++               Do you think Congress could prevent foreign individuals from funding speech in United States elections?              Private individuals, foreigners who -- who want to --              Well, it's not different. I asked it because I thought it was related to the question you were answering.             It -- it covers totally -- totally owned corporations, too, doesn't it?             I mean, if I owned all the stock in a corporation, the corporation still can't --             It didn't say it would come out differently.    It just said, we're not deciding that case, right?             I don't mind citing that. Bellotti didn't decide that.             I -- I -- I thought that Buckley had narrowed the statute precisely to magic words and still found it unconstitutional as applied to corporations that made independent expenditures.             Isn't that what happened in Buckley?             And some of the plaintiffs were corporations.            Don't keep us in suspense. (Laughter.)             There are -- there are two separate questions that -- that have been raised in opposition to your position.           One is -- one is that we should not resolve a broad constitutional issue where there are narrower grounds, and that's the question you are responding to. An entirely separate question is the issue of stare decisis, and you acknowledge that stare decisis was not involved in New York Times v. Sullivan, but the first question obviously was.
08-214 +++$+++                Is any of them called punitive damages?     Do you know of any case in which a court has --               And punitive damages, of course, requires that you first find the guilty person to lose the case.     So what if a person makes these terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive damages.               We've got to call it something else, don't we?                Whose dissent was that?         I have forgotten that.         Whose dissent was it?                Do you recall?    Stewart?             Excuse me, that the maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the punitive damages claim could be made?
08-22 +++$+++               Who says?        Have we ever held that?              A guarantee against even --               "Has always endeavored."               "Has always endeavored." "Has always endeavored."               And there are rules in the States that do endeavor to do that.               And you claim that there is such a temptation here because of gratitude?               You've been around Washington a long time.       How far do you think gratitude goes in -- in the general political world?                 Yes, but that -- that person contributed money to my election because he expected me to be a fair and impartial judge.              And I would be faithful to that contributor only by being a fair and impartial judge.           That is showing gratitude.        I should do what he expected me to do, and I have no reason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases in order to come out his way.              What I expected he wanted me to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful to him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by being a good judge.                 It isn't a matter of honor and sacrifice.   You talk as though what gratitude consists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but that is not necessarily what gratitude consists of. Gratitude consists of performing the way this person would like me to perform.          Now, in this case, I will acknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based upon more.   This contributor never even met the judge, did he?              They're certainly not good buddies.              And his contributions, as I understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that -- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in favor of the plaintiffs' bar.             And if -- if the contribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to me it would simply be that this other candidate would do what he promised in his campaign and that is not be an activist judge and not distort the tort law of the State.              No, they don't say that.              There are only two categories of cases, only two categories.                 One -- one is where the judge is almost the aggrieved party in conducting contempt proceedings against someone who is contemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is cases where the judges have a financial interest. That's far from this broad category of whenever there is a possibility of bias. I was appointed to the bench by Ronald Reagan.    Should I be any -- should I have been any less grateful to Ronald Reagan than -- than the judge here was grateful to the person who spent a lot of money in his election?                Two categories are the only categories in which it has applied that.                Nice, clear, and true.             Are you going to tell me why I shouldn't have been grateful to Ronald Reagan?             And he had a lot of, a lot of issues coming before me while his presidency continued.              Was their standard the same as yours?     I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in this case.     The various amici and -- and you come up with, you know, a wide divergence of standards.              And all of them say:    By the way, these seven factors or five factors or six factors, whatever they say, are not exhaustive; There may be others as well.              Right?              But not the only central factor.              You said it's one central factor.              You really have no test other than probability of bias.             We can't -- we can't run a system on -- on such a vague standard.              Not -- not for situations that have such an infinite variety as -- as the appointment of judges and the election of judges and -- and as funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund or joining some agglomeration of -- of other institutions that fund. The -- the variety is immense, and you give us nothing to hang onto except, you know, case by case we're going to have to decide whether there's a probability of bias.              Don't you think it would be easier to solve the problem, as some States have done, not by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever judge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but simply limiting the amount of contributions that can be made?     Isn't -- isn't that a much more sensible solution?              And some of them are doing that.              I thought they closed the 527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much above the individual limit.              Wait, you can't have it both ways.   I mean, if your response to the first question is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't respond to the second question would it make a difference if he was term limited by saying, no, it wouldn't make a difference.
08-240 +++$+++         Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that you don't really object to the recognition of constructive termination,  if that phrase is used the way it is used elsewhere in contract law?        Gee, I thought -- I thought that if you had a lease and the landlord fails to provide heat, that you can move out and he will be deemed to have constructively evicted you.        Yes, but what happens after that?     Don't you take the position that the station owner then has to refuse all other elements of the contract, right?        Now, wait, wait --        I thought you said there is a termination by the company if it fails to provide one of the three basic elements, right?           That is a termination?           What response has to be made by the station owner?      Anything?           He can continue to take the other two elements?           Yes or no?           And there has still been a termination?          Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is all one contract, isn't it?             You are saying --          You're saying you can terminate a third of the contract?          And they are not contingent on each other, so that at any time the company could terminate one of them and stick the station owner with the other two?          Not continues to be.        You must continue to be.          That sounds like a very strange way to write the contract.         I'm not talking about writing the statute.    I'm talking about writing the contract.         Do you really think that that's how those contracts should be interpreted?         What does the company have to do in your view to effect a genuine termination and not a constructive termination?        Why isn't that constructive termination?        I mean, the conduct is you stopped sending me the gas you are supposed to send me.        Well, I don't understand what your number two consists of unless it consists of an act that the other side would call constructive -- or the government would call constructive termination.        Yes.        I think there s always an unclear line between those two.
08-267 +++$+++                  So therefore one could say that that point wasn't decided in the case, right?                Mr. Shah, could you tell us what the government's position is on whether, when somebody has been discharged from the service and then a conviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in the service is set aside, can he be retried in military courts? REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
08-289 +++$+++               Excuse me.      I am not following this exchange because I don't understand whether the -- the statewide percentage is the statewide percentage of English learners or the statewide percentage of all students.                If you can't answer that, I think Justice Breyer can.          But I would like to know what comparison --                I don't.        That's -- that's exactly true.   But --               I assume it's --               I also assume the State law does not require that any -- any judicial decree with respect to a particular district be expanded to the whole State.   It seems to me you could comply with the State Constitution.       If and when a judgment is rendered as to the district, it would then be, under the State Constitution, the responsibility of the State executive to make sure that the other -- other districts are equalized. But why the attorney general had to come into the Federal court and say, do it to the whole State, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I can't understand that, to tell you the truth.              The fact is he wanted to be thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?              The State attorney general wanted the decree.              Yes, but didn't -- didn't the court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they have a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act.                     But didn't the -- didn't the district court find that the funding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons that were mentioned earlier?              Well, I -- I agree with that.   I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State attorney general wanted that done.              But that's -- that's water over the dam.    That's not what this suit is about now.             Which would be good enough to fix Nogales.   So you are quite right.                 There is a vast difference in each district.                But that attorney general wanted enough money to fund the whole State the way you have to fund to -- to fix Nogales.                  That's what he wanted.             It is no content to the equal child -- No Child Left Behind.                     There is no content to it.    All it requires is testing.             You can't say how much it's going to cost.
08-295 +++$+++                Well, there is a distinction between jurisdiction and whether the action taken by the bankruptcy court comes within the statute. But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap. I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy clause and there is jurisdiction.               But what if the bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a certain amount of money and it's conceded that this company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court says, this is a national problem and this other company ought to contribute.              Do you think that would be within the bankruptcy power?              They can do anything under the bankruptcy law?              Okay, that's fine.   I'm not arguing about that.      I'm arguing about the principle that you are asking us to accept, to wit, that this challenge cannot possibly be based upon jurisdiction. Surely there are some things that simply do not fall within the bankruptcy power.              Isn't that true?              Okay.       And that --              Well, what you are saying is this does fall within the bankruptcy power.                   But don't tell us that it is not a challenge based upon the jurisdiction of the court and based exclusively upon the statute.   It could be based upon both.              But you acknowledge that that's not true.    You acknowledge that they couldn't have issued the hypothetical order that the Chief Justice proposed, even if that was necessary, even if Travelers said, we will not kick in the money up to the limits of our liability unless you make us immune from all traffic accidents.        You acknowledged that that's no good, right?
08-304 +++$+++               But under your proposal a State that itself is guilty of fraud can, in effect, immunize -- if not immunize itself, at least render the information unusable by conducting a hearing.                 It would be a -- would it be a civil hearing?      A deposition -- you would consider a deposition to be a civil hearing?                 What -- what provision would it come under?                 Documents are -- documents are a hearing?             Meant more than hearing?             That's an argument that doesn't go very far with me.           I mean, "hearing" means hearing.              Well, I think there would be a good lawsuit as to whether "congressional report" includes a GAO report.        I think that's a lawsuit.        I don't think it's at all as clear as you suggest.              Yes, well, that argument does not scare the government.              I think the government would like to read "administrative hearing" in the first -- in the first phrase as being limited to Federal administrative hearing as well.            And that was on -- on the basis of the first, the first phrase rather than the second?              Stars and Stripes, maybe.             We should stop calling them clauses.   They are really phrases.             Phrases.            Part of the random nature of the whole provision, right?              When we say everybody's working in a certain context, how -- how many people is everybody?     What percentage of the House and of the Senate were involved in these committees that were drafting these bills and that issued the committee report?             But what your claim is -- is that the government -- the Federal government is not the only person harmed?             And, therefore -- you know, we should listen to them, so long as they don't -- they want to come out this way, you are saying the State and local governments --             -- are significantly harmed.             Which the Federal government doesn't care about, right?
08-305 +++$+++                Of course, (ii) through (iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicit requirement of (i).               (i) is only at most a negative implication, which -- which one would not draw in light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.                 Of course, the parents here didn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after the school district had found that their child didn't require any special education, did they?                 They -- they put him in a private school without even consulting the schools.                 Saying by the way, we can get some money.   How much -- how much money are you talking about imposing on the school district here?                 A month?              Maybe -- I'm sorry.             This school does not have to come up with an IEP.         It could tough it out and say, we're going to rest on our belief that this child does not need any special education, right?                   And unless the school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special services.             Could the district appeal? That's the end of the road?           Can't the district say the hearing officer is wrong?             And if it does, does it have to take any action in the interim.               Which is --                Would you be surprised to find a court decision which says that when the reason that the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement that he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the district's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a plan, that subsection (2) does not apply?                You can't profit by your own malfeasance.               But you -- you don't think -- you don't think a court could say the only reason these people could not comply with (ii) is that the school district made it impossible by not complying with the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they -- they can recover for the private placement?               I think it's more than conceivable.   I know a lot of courts that would hold that.
08-310 +++$+++               Yes, but you -- you want us to ignore the -- the State tax.               Do you really want us to do that?    I mean, it would be the easiest thing in the world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing it at the State level, to authorize the municipality to do it.   I don't want this case to come back here for a second time.              Now -- now that the municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used to impose, don't you think you have to count both of them?              You are going to get a fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds.                  All it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.                 Including a -- a cruise ship is covered.    I --              Was your answer to the Chief Justice that if there is a tonnage tax imposed on everything including -- including ships, it would still violate the Tonnage Clause.              Is that right?              It's my -- it's my hypothetical.     I made it up. (Laughter.)              Do you think it would be okay?              It's only discrimination that counts?              Well, there's some -- there's some fight about that, obviously.                       There -- there is no fight about the fact that this tax is based upon how long the ship remains in port, right?              Right.           How many days it remains in port.              Which means, the argument could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use of the port.    And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing taxes on ships that bring in goods.               But you don't think a daily -- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port violates the Tonnage Clause?               Is this anything else than that?                Not felt by the other States, felt by the consumers in other States. Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil.                All of whom are going to be outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, right?                It's a neat tax, you know, get somebody else to pay your taxes.
08-322 +++$+++               Well, has preclearance been denied to you?             But you're subject to preclearance and you cannot make changes without going to the Attorney General and asking for his permission.             Is it any different from, from a -- a Federal law prohibiting certain speech?              Do you have to subject yourself to the -- to the penalty for that speech before you can attack the law?              I don't think so.
08-351 +++$+++           It wasn't granted then, and it still hasn't been granted.          So you have nobody before this Court with a live claim, neither the original named plaintiffs nor a certified class.          So who's here?            What were they seeking to have enjoined?          But -- I -- since they defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can  - can they possibly have any claim left with regard to an interim hearing?          And they -- and they can do that before the -- before the time period has expired?           The statute is a dead letter if you allow a Slocum action.             All you -- all you need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute says you have to wait for -- you know, that the government has 40 days, is meaningless.           Exactly.     It's a way of defeating the statute.              But the statute says the government isn't dilatory until -- until the time period, 40 days.    It has 40 days.             What does that mean if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days?              Before the 40 days?              Oh, okay.     Well, that's a different story.    These people are asking for a hearing before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40 days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't satisfy what they are asking for.             It doesn't have to do anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.             But you say if it -- you don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you -- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a Slocum action.   I mean, which is it?                One or the other?            Ten years?            Ten years?            You ve -- you ve given up the position, then.     You've said time does matter.           So we are just arguing over what the time is, whether it's 10 years, 1 year, or 40 days, right?            It may be, but that's a different argument.     It's -- it's not an absolute. It's -- we have to consider whether the time period is reasonable, right?          Well, what were they seeking to enjoin?           Suppose a situation in which the property taken is really essential to the -- to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it -- a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every day.    And -- and there is really no reason why the -- why the government has to wait that long. Is there no procedure by which he can say, you know -- do it quickly.          You don't have to wait so long.    I'm the owner.    I'm the only owner.       I can -- I can prove that.    Let's have a quick hearing.          I thought they didn't.           I thought some didn't have it returned, but there was a settlement.          The mootness was not a result of any settlement between the city and --          Your -- your friend said the opposite.    I mean --          I don't understand.          They got all of their property back?          No, I don't understand. They got their cars back, right?          The people who had money at stake, what happened to the money?          A settlement?          So you have at least one case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement. You have at least one plaintiff, and you can't get the kind of remand for mootness that you are asking for.          But we don't do Munsingwear orders where -- where the mootness is a result of a settlement.
08-441 +++$+++                Excuse me.      That -- that statement may be wrong depending upon how you read Price Waterhouse, might it not?         The first statement, that we've never imposed such a requirement.                I mean, if you think Justice O'Connor's opinion was the determinative opinion in Price Waterhouse, then -- then we had.               It was dictum.      They may have been wrong.                Could -- before you sit down, I -- I have been trying to figure out Justice White's opinion in Price Waterhouse.                    I mean, indeed he -- he voted to -- to remand the case, as did -- as did the four in the plurality, but for a very different reason.   They remanded because -- "We reverse the court of appeals' judgment against Price Waterhouse because the courts below erred by deciding that the defendant must make" the proof of he would have been fired anyway by clear and convincing evidence.                That -- that was the basis for their reversing and remanding. That was not Justice White's, because -- he said "because the court of appeals required Price Waterhouse to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reached the same" -- "in the absence of the improper motive.        Rather than merely requiring proof by a preponderance of the evidence, I concur in the judgment reversing this case in part and remanding. With respect to the employer's burden, however, the plurality seems to require that the employer submit objective evidence."      And he disagreed with that.
08-453 +++$+++                Excuse me.      The same rule would not apply in Michigan and Hawaii, anyway, even under the Federal Government.             The Federal Government acknowledges that Michigan can have its own law --             -- and Hawaii can have a different law.    All the Federal Government is arguing is:   We want to be the ones to enforce the separate Michigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?              You don't deny, do you, that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce the State laws?              So this provision isn't really contrary to what you are saying.                You are just saying the State can do it as well?              I thought that was your position, that the -- that the visitation authority includes the power to enforce general laws.              Of the sovereign.     But that a separate action to enforce the laws of the sovereign does not necessarily mean that visitorial powers are being exercised.              So there would be no inconsistency, if you believe that.              Ms. Underwood, I -- I forgot the response you made in your brief.                  I know you did make some response to subsection (b) of section 484. How do you -- how do you explain that?              Yes.      Why -- why do they list those exceptions, unless one would think that everything is covered?              I suppose if -- if enforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably ought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any more heavily than we have to upon the States so that where there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say is the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not enforceable?              I mean that would --
08-472 +++$+++               General Kagan, before you go -- go on with your argument, you presented it as -- as though the issue before us is the -- the conveying of the land.   But is it? What this was was simply an affirmation of the prior injunction.      The court of appeals said the prior injunction had not been mooted by the -- by the transfer of the land.      So isn't really the issue whether that -- that prior injunction, when the land did indeed belong to the government, whether that prior injunction was valid?             Right.             But didn't the court of appeals say no?             So -- so what we have before us is the court of appeals' affirmation of the prior injunction, which applied to a cross on public land.                Of course, if I -- if I thought the display wasn't unconstitutional, the transfer would a fortiori not --              It seems to me unreasonable to read the injunction to say the government shall not permit anybody to display a cross on that land no matter who owns the land.     I assume the injunctions meant you will not permit the cross to be displayed on this parcel of government land.
08-479 +++$+++                But I -- I think you're really caught in -- in a dilemma here.                 Your answer suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search in this case.               But people have been known to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities.                 What is the -- what is the principle under which you would allow a strip search but disallow a cavity search?               Had it been --               Had it been the case that, as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping ibuprofen, weren't they?             I guess they might pop aspirin as well.   I'm not aware that one gets a high on either one of those.      Somebody in -- in the school had gotten almost fatally ill about a year before this incident; isn't that right?             On over-the-counter drugs.             A prescription, not over- the-counter.              Did the school know what -- what particular pills it was searching for?             Did it know that -- what -- what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or some prescription drug?             How did he know it was an OTC pill?             Just by looking at it?             Okay.             What was in it?    Did he say --               Any contraband, like the black marker pencil that -- that astounded me.                That was contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker pencil?               Oh, is that what they do?               They sniff them?               Really?              Could I come back to your distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search. What would you require before you would allow a cavity search?              No cavity search in school, no matter what?                I assume a school can assign a student to study hall.               That's not considered a government seizure.      Isn't that an obvious part of the parental supervision that a school exercises, sit here and stay there.                Schools do that all the time, don't they?              Well, I suppose you could say that about any strip search, couldn't you:                     That there is never a need for a strip search?                     You could always give the -- you know, the suspected felon, you know:   Here, change into this suit.                    And -- and we haven't adopted some such rule, have we?             Well, one of the defendants doesn't have qualified immunity.             So don't we have to, for that defendant at least, decide the constitutional question?             You -- you have to, under your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion specifically that -- that the student is hiding the contraband in the student's underwear?             Now, if -- if you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you search every other place, you search in the student's pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs, don't you have, after conducting all these other searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in her underpants?             All right.             Your logic fails me.             You -- you reasonably suspect the student has drugs.               You've searched everywhere else.    By God, the drugs must be in her underpants.               Excuse me.       That wouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just given us.     I thought you said there had to be specific indication that she was carrying it in her undergarments.      And what Justice Alito posed was not that, just specific indication that she had it on her person.     Is that enough?         Do you want to revise your test so it's not just specific indication that it's in her undergarments, but specific indication that it's on her person?     That's enough?               So there is a sliding scale for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?                Unless the people feel differently.                Some school districts have rules against --                -- simply forbidding strip searches on any -- right?
08-495 +++$+++               Mr. Moseley --              I don't -- I don't understand how you squeeze your -- your modified categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex machina which is intended to blunt the government's argument that very few statutes would be covered by this.   I don't see how you get that out of the word "convicted." Are you convicted of an offense involving more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than $10,000?   Does that cause you to have been convicted of that?   You are convicted of what you are charged with. You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not -- not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the jury to be questioned about.               -- your earlier -- your earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that -- that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true.               I mean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines are mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury determination.   We've said they are discretionary.               So if you don't have a jury determination, you can still sentence on the basis of the amount taken, even though that was not found by the jury.                I hope in rebuttal you'll address the argument about deferring to the agency's finding about what it means.              We usually do that.                You can save it for rebuttal.             To come back to the deference point, you say -- is this relevant to the criminal conviction?      He's convicted criminally regardless of how you read that.               You acknowledge it doesn't -- it isn't an element of the crime, and so to be convicted criminally you acknowledge you don't have to show the amount --              -- right?              Well, in that later criminal proceeding, they would have to prove it undoubtedly --              But this is not a later criminal proceeding; this is an administrative proceeding.    And why shouldn't it be up to the BIA initially to determine how to interpret this language for purposes of the deportation laws?                 But there -- was it not true that there the interpretation placed upon the statute by BIA would also be the interpretation necessary to secure the criminal conviction?                       And that's not the case here.
08-5274 +++$+++                  Excuse me.      What -- what -- I guess I'm not following this.               You say it would be true that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his own gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that would come within this?                 You say under the government's it would?        I don't think it would under the government's either.       Do you?                 Ah, that's different, yes.                  I guess it's also the government's view -- this is even weirder -- that it doesn't matter who brandishes the gun.                    The -- the bank guard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that also gets additional time served for the bank robber. It doesn't seem fair.              -- is something that should be punished more severely.             Excuse me?       That would be for the judge?                Which -- it's during the bank robbery.              Why?      You place a lot of reliance on this:    During and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.                     But that -- that's in the prologue, and it applies only to the matter covered in the prologue -- to wit, "During and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm." That -- that's what all that language "during and relation to" applies to.                     And then it continues:   "Shall," if that "in relation to" exists, "in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:" One, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than five"; two; and number three, what we're dealing with here, "if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years." I don't see how that language during and in relation to any crime of violence applies to anything, except the use or carrying of a firearm.              Why is that?     How could you -- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer than by ending the first, the introduction with a dash, and then putting 1, 2, and 3?               I mean, it seems to me that it applies to the portion before the dash.              How would -- how would a discharge not be during and in relation to?               Give me an example of -- of what you're worried about.              But that -- excuse me. That's not -- that's not covered.               Number 3 only applies to someone who has already been guilty of what's set forth in the prologue.              And that's the only connection that's necessary.           You have to have done what was set forth in the prologue, and it has -- has to be in the course of doing that.            But "the course of doing that" means just in the course of using a firearm in connection with the bank robbery.              Why do we have to find that the phrase "if a firearm is brandished" and the later phrase "if a firearm is discharged" require intentional brandishing and intentional discharging?                Why can't we limit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the firearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon or if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite undetermined whether it has to be intentionally discharged, or even intentionally brandished for that matter.              The definition of brandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put another person in fear.
08-538 +++$+++              Where would she say that, 100 percent interest in the equipment?               Would she say that in -- in column 3?             Column 3 says "Value of claimed exemption."             Well, I mean, you say that. But, boy, I wouldn't read -- I wouldn't read the -- I wouldn't read the -- the chart that way.             It has a column that says "Value of claimed exemption."             Right.           Right.           Except that the -- that the last column does -- it s very clearly entitled "Current market value of property" without deducting exemptions. There's no way to read that last figure of 10,718 except as her assessment of the market value of her cooking equipment.          That -- is that where she would write 100 percent -- in the third column, rather than the fourth?            Well, now, wait.      Why would the trustee object?      I mean, he would still be objecting to the valuation.     You say that he has no -- no obligation to object to the valuation. But if she writes 100 percent of value in the third column, that's what she's claimed, and then values it at something above the exemption, right? Above the permissible objection, he's still objecting to the valuation, isn't he?       No?            I see.
08-586 +++$+++               And for lawyers?              Lawyers have a fiduciary obligation to their clients; right?              So courts should review lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair result.             That's different from normal trust law, isn't it?             Normally where you are a fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was reasonable.             So Congress evidently did not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.                No, but he protects the company ultimately, because when investors leave the company that is charging excessive fees to go to other companies, the company that they are leaving sees that something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to its adviser.   Why doesn't that affect the company at issue?            Mr. Frederick, I don't understand your statement that they can't fire the investment adviser.      Maybe they can't fire him, but they can insist that he accept a lower fee, right?             Surely they can do that, can't they?              Can they insist that he accept a lower fee?      Can they do that.              Why?              Oh, no, that's something different.   Let's assume you have a disinterested board of directors, which is what the statute requires.             You tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't fire the adviser.     It seems to me, while they can't fire him, they can say:     We are going to cut your fee in half.   Whereupon they don't have to fire him.            He will pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser. Doesn't that work?            Well, it must be aware of the -- of the divergence between the fees that investment advisers charge to these companies and what they charge to other clients.             Isn't the SEC aware of that?            And yet has brought no suits against this industry?            For disclosure, just for disclosure.    But that suggests to me that the SEC may think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and that the comparison with investment advice given to other entities is -- is not a fair one.             But even if there is full disclosure, your position is in every case a court must decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.
08-598 +++$+++  
08-6 +++$+++                Would the other side concede the premise that he doesn't say that this is going to exonerate him?          That he has -- you know -- here's some -- some evidence out there.                   It may help me; it may hurt me.     I don't know which, but I'd like to see it.     Is that the only claim he's making?               If so, it's -- it's a lot less -- what should I say -- a lot less plausible a constitutional claim.                  There's some evidence that I'd like to look at; I'm not saying it will prove me innocent.    I'd just like to look at this evidence. Might, might not.     That's a lot weaker claim than what I had thought he was making, which is the claim that this -- this new scientific evidence will -- will prove my innocence.               Well, which is he doing here?    Is he saying the latter or not?               So it's not a constitutional claim of entitlement to evidence which he asserts will prove his innocence, but rather a constitutional claim to evidence which might or then might not prove his innocence?              Is that --               Well, we're assuming the premise, though, in the questioning.               That was not the state of the art at the time, was it?               He didn't ask for that.               Of course, that relief would require him to assert his innocence, wouldn't it? He would have to bring a habeas corpus action claiming that the State has no business holding him because in fact he's innocent? He doesn't want to do that?                    He just wants to say, I'd just like to see this evidence.                     It might help me.   It might not help me, but --              I thought you said the State has -- has indeed granted a habeas request.                  In that case, where it granted the habeas request, although it turned out that the evidence was destroyed, in that case surely the same situation -- the same situation existed.                 It is the case you are referring to.   I didn't -- I didn't make it up.                     You did.                 No.     I'm talking about the case you alluded to earlier where you say the State of Alaska had indeed provided DNA evidence or had agreed to provide it --                 -- but for the fact that it no longer existed.      Now, in that case surely the same problem existed that Justice Souter is -- is raising. That -- that person also, while claiming innocence, couldn't say for sure what the evidence would produce, but that didn't stop the State from providing it; did it?              I thought you said they were still pending.              You think we could attach that to the new constitutional right that we invent?               It would be a constitutional right to get it if -- if -- but if you lose, you get another three years?               Could we say that?             Especially, I would assume, one constitutional right in which you do not even have to assert your innocence.                 Well, you would still want to leave yourself open to make the objection that he had a chance to get this at trial and -- and -- and decided not to get it.                 Wouldn't those objections continue to apply?                 I mean, it -- it seems to me that -- that all -- all that you have to concede is that there is some means for him to get into court, with those -- those exceptions that other States make; and other States make an exception for gaming the system. So, so long as he can get in in habeas corpus it seems to me you can very well leave for later whether you are going to concede that even though -- even though he didn't ask for it at trial, he can get it now.                 Well, why give it away?                 -- any more than you gave away the fact that this is going to --
08-604 +++$+++             Do I understand you to say that that provision was not applicable here anyway?            Does the other side contest that?
08-6261 +++$+++               Excuse me.       He didn't make that argument, though.         I mean, his -- as I recall, his only complaint was that he had been promised that - that he wouldn't be -- he wouldn't be prosecuted.               And that was his only complaint below, wasn't it?             Right.             He made the constitutional claim below?              Excuse me.          It's not just the Southern District; it's also what, the State?              I got you.              That did puzzle me.    I was wondering if there's -- if there's coordinate jurisdiction.   Can the -- can the District prosecute for crimes that the Attorney General can prosecute for?              -- the States don't have the same compulsion that the Federal Government has, which arises from the separation of powers.              And - which -- which means that it is the executive that has the right to prosecute, and States are not bound by such a thing.   And they can perhaps allow private individuals to prosecute, whereas the only exception we have made from the -- from the chief executive's authority to prosecute is Young, which is a very narrow exception, dealing with the Court's ability to protect itself from contempt of its orders. And here the court had nothing to do with the appointment of this private party, right?             This wouldn't be allowed under Young.     I mean, if Young made anything clear is you couldn't appoint as a prosecutor an interested party.   And here is the most the interested party of all.                So don't -- don't -- don't say that Young would have allowed it.              Does -- does the Justice Department concede that the sovereign here is the United States?   Does the Justice Department concede -              -- that there can't be a separate prosecutor from -- from the Assistant United States Attorney and that is the prosecutor for the District of Columbia?              You don't understand them to be saying that?              Okay.              Is the District a territory?             You did raise, undoubtedly you say, the point that the only way in which she could be the prosecutor was as an agent of the United States?             And that it was unconstitutional for her to -- to represent herself.
08-645 +++$+++            How many --         I thought it has to be psychological harm to the child; isn t that right?         So psychological harm to the woman who can't work in the country would be irrelevant.         -- unless that would secondarily affect the child?
08-651 +++$+++           Well, we can't leave that for another day.     I mean, we -- we have to decide whether we are opening a Pandora's box here, whether there is any sensible way to restrict it to -- to deportation. What about advice on whether pleading guilty would -- would cause him to lose custody of his children?     That's -- that's pretty serious. What if pleading guilty will -- will affect whether he can keep his truck, which is his main means of livelihood, or whether -- whether it would be seized by the government as the instrument of his crime? There are so many pieces of advice which involve legal issues that -- that counsel can provide advice on.          Sure.          Sure.            But that's -- that's -- with due respect, that's ridiculous.                 If it's important enough to be required to be told to the defendant by his counsel, surely it's important enough to be advised to the defendant by the court before the guilty plea is accepted as -- as voluntary, which includes knowing  - knowing the consequences.         It's a very strange line you draw between what we are going to hold counsel to and what we are going to require the defendant to be advised of by the court.          I would think that the duty of the criminal lawyer is to make sure that the defendant's guilty plea is informed, it is an informed guilty plea.     That is the same obligation of the court in the colloquy, to be sure that it's an informed plea. And if you say it's uninformed for counsel not to go into the myriad collateral consequences, then I assume it's -- it's improper for the court not to go into those consequences.     They both pertain to whether the guilty plea is informed.     That's counsel's responsibility.          Well --            I thought -- I thought he was asked what was in the -- what was in the containers and he said marijuana.          Excue me, I'm not sure that parole eligibility could qualify as a collateral consequence.          It goes to the sentence. It goes to what the sentence will be, which is certainly part of the trial.          Why do you say that?    Why do you say that?     Or there has not been a revolution or what?    What -- how do you know?
08-660 +++$+++                  So that's the question, whether that's enough or whether the government's power to prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone enough?                 I understand that.      But -- but I'm saying there are various steps the governments -- the government can take, and I -- I think you have a point, that even though this case may be an easy one, we're going to have to decide in future cases how much -- how much activity by the government is enough activity to make the government a party.                And if it turns out the government is not going to come in, you can always dismiss the appeal.             Well, anyway, a rule's a rule and discussing all of these consequences is beside the point.   If, indeed, the government's a party, it's 60 days, right, and you say the government's a party?             And is -- is it your position that the government is a party to this case for all purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is it just some of them?             As opposed to the government's view, which does sort of pick and choose between --             Well, your argument goes -- is replying to the government the Respondent's argument that there is no sense in giving 60 days to the government, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes there is.             Even when the government has not actively participated.             So it really negates, you know, you're doing something that has no point.                It could have a point, to give the government 60 days, even in a case where it has not actively participated.                It may need that long to consult with other agencies as to whether to accept a defeat in this case or -- or on its own to conduct an appeal if the relator doesn't want to.             I'm sure the government will agree with that.       I'm sure that's one of the contexts in which they agree that the government is a party.             But there are some provisions that -- that seem to indicate the government isn't a party.    For example, it specifically provides that even when the government hasn't intervened, the government may request copies of the pleadings.                     Doesn't it have to make requests for them?             Well, why would it have to do that if it's a party?             So you're -- I mean, you're saying they are not a party for that rule at least, that requires the pleadings to be served upon the other party.             Right.              I'm not following you.      I'm saying if -- if the government is a party, Rule 5 would apply and the government would automatically get copies of the pleading whether or not it requested them.                So the provision in the False Claims Act that the government will only get copies if it requests them seems to indicate that the government is not a party.                Can I come back to the Rule 5 point just for a minute?            You say that the effect of the False Claims Act is simply to restrict what would normally be the right of the government to get copies of all the pleadings.      That's really not how it reads.                 It doesn't say that the government shall receive copies of the pleadings only if it requests them.                   It says the government shall receive copies of the pleadings if it requests them, as though without that provision it wouldn't have a right to receive copies.                   Isn't that the way it reads?                Well, that's what we are down here, you know. (Laughter.)                Precision.                May be for other purposes? I thought you told me before that it was for other purposes as well.                Okay.       Let's stay on track.               Where is that?       What provision is that?      I didn't focus on that.               Yes.      I am sorry.    I didn't mean to eat up your time with this.               I mean, where is it in the stuff that I have?               Yes, but that doesn't say anything about discovery in particular.                   I thought you were talking about some declination provision that -- that said the government is -- is not subject to discovery.             And -- and the fact that it cannot conduct discovery also involves the fact that it's immune from discovery, how do you get that?                And it is; is it not?             Oh, I'm sure it's the government's position.             But how can that -- how can that be if it's a party?             The declination provision doesn't say that.    The declination provision just says that it is not actively conducting the case.                  But how do you get its exemption from discovery?             I agree with that, but -- but it's -- it's for me a problem with your assertion that for all purposes the government is a party.                  It seems to me it is not a party for purposes of discovery, and there is no provision in -- in the -- in the False Claims Act that exempts it from discovery.             That's -- that's true, but that's not the point that Justice Souter was making. This is a self-denying position on the part of the government.    You would expect the government to come in and say, yeah, give us 60 days to think this over. They're saying, no, we'll only take 30, because they're worried if we come out your way on that issue, there are other issues on which they're also going to be considered a party, and it's not worth the risk.

Or is it just the issue of whether the lower court was wrong to dismiss your suit on the basis that this is a unitary operation?          I thought that was the only issue.          Well, why am I worrying about this other stuff?
08-67 +++$+++                 But we said -- we said in Ashe, didn't we, that you should take into account all the circumstances in determining what was decided in the first acquittal, all the circumstances.                 How can -- how can you close your eyes to the circumstance that is alleged here, that the -- the hung jury portion of the jury's verdict is simply inconsistent with the acquittal portion, and therefore you should not count the acquittal for double jeopardy purposes?                 Isn't this part of the total circumstances?              It shows -- it shows that -- that the point on which they -- you assert they were unanimous and the point on which you say later prosecution should be disallowed was in fact a point on which the jury was confused, because they would have come out the other way if indeed they were unanimous on the counts that -- that acquitted.                  They should have come out the same way on the -- on the hung counts.              The point is that they were deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked, assuming we don't inquire into -- into the issue that Justice Souter raised -- they were deadlocked and would not have been deadlocked if indeed they made the -- the acquittal finding that you're relying upon for double jeopardy.
08-674 +++$+++           Did the lower court reach that question?             Did we grant cert on that question?          He took the words right out of your mouth. (Laughter.)           You could call them all advisory opinions if you want.           Whenever there is another issue in the case --           -- for which we remand, you could say, oh, we're just giving an advisory opinion on the issue that --          Yes or no?          Okay.          Just and reasonable, or would comply with the public interest standard?          I mean, what's the use of having Mobile-Sierra if -- if they're going to reexamine the thing under the usual standard anyway?          You're saying, in effect, that Mobile-Sierra does not apply to an agreement between A and B that not only sets the rate between the two, but also fixes the rate that one of them will charge to C? The last feature is not a Mobile-Sierra -- is not eligible for Mobile-Sierra treatment.          Right.       But that's -- but that's not what the D.C. Circuit said.          The D.C. Circuit said that the entire -- there is no application of Mobile-Sierra at all.            Well, we -- we don't know that that's the other side's position.            I was going to ask him that.    Their position is that the third party can -- can attack the -- the agreement without being encumbered by Mobile-Sierra, but I don't know that they've said that once a third party does mount such an attack the Commission is suddenly also unencumbered by Mobile-Sierra.            I have assumed that their position is the Commission remains bound by Mobile- Sierra, but these third parties can -- can demand a court -- that a court apply a different standard.            We can --            I'm not sure that's any stranger than saying the Commission has one standard until somebody else challenges it, whereupon the Commission has a different standard.                 You don't think that's strange?          Yes. (Laughter.)             I like that.    That's very imaginative. (Laughter.)
08-678 +++$+++                Mr. Allen, except for the fact that you and I are lawyers, do you really think that the -- that confidentiality right is any more important to the proper functioning of society than, let's say, the protection of trade secrets?                 So that in a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no, turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to interlocutory appeal in that case?                  And if not there, then why here?              The same thing with a trade secret.     It is a suit between another company who is a competitor of yours --              And the Judge says, turn over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and you say no.    No interlocutory appeal, right?            Or do you say there should be an interlocutory appeal there?                Okay.      Let's talk about predictability.    Once you make an exception for waiver, there is already that limitation.                 It's not absolute. Maybe it can be waived. Secondly, you have to worry about a district court finding it to have been waived, even though it really wasn't.    That's another point of doubt. And, thirdly, you have to worry about the Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly found it to have been waived because we give, you know, weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district court. Once you -- once you factor in all of those uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know, about a fail-safe privilege at all.                     There are those doubts, and I'm not sure the doubts are increased enormously, by simply saying a district court may make a mistake without -- without your being able to go up to the court of appeals on that mistake.
08-680 +++$+++             Why do you say the rule is three days?    What rule is that?            Yeah, but you -- you are not arguing for a seven-day limit no matter what, even if he is held in jail, are you?             Right.            Would it be a good idea to say that?            I thought we liked clear lines in this.   I mean, the police won't know what to do.            You started to tell us why this case was important.         Would you -- would you finish that?   You said there were --               I -- I thought that you couldn't approach him.        I thought that once he's invoked his right to counsel, you can't approach him and say, would you like to talk now?            Right?           Isn't that -- isn't that the rule?             Well, if the incarceration is a continuation of custodial custody, to be redundant, if it is a continuation of the custody, then why wouldn't asking him whether he would like to see visitors who want to ask him about a particular crime, why wouldn't that be a violation of Edwards?             I'm sure they would.             So the -- the -- the scheme that Justice Stevens proposes wouldn't work.          You would be violating Edwards when you asked him if he wanted to see interrogators.              Or to the police who have to decide whether they can interrogate or not.
08-681 +++$+++                 That wouldn't be deciding it the same way twice.       Initially, they would just have to decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by clear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if they decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they have to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of the evidence.   So it's really a different call the second time.              That's true.              What do you claim that (f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?             Why would he seek to enjoin his removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard when he just seeks to stay the removal?                 I mean, does he have a bad lawyer or what?             Why wouldn't he go to the court of appeals, is the next question.                 That's a fluke.     I mean, that is a flukey situation.              And I find it hard to believe that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.                 Also a fluke.    We don't expect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.
08-6925 +++$+++              This -- this statute is a misdemeanor statute, isn't it?             Yeah.      And the only reason what happened here was elevated to a felony was that he had a prior offense.             So it's understandable that the slightest touch could -- could constitute a misdemeanor.             But we don't have to know what's more normal anyway, do we?             If -- if any conviction is possible under the element of the crime to touch, when there is simply slight physical force, your argument still stands, right?             Well, of course it's right. You don't have to touch somebody for an assault.             You can just threaten somebody.            Of course it's right.            Certainly not.                Isn't there a separate -- a separate battery crime, aggravated battery, in -- in Florida, which --                Well, this isn't -- this isn't a felony battery statute.                This is a misdemeanor battery statute, which has been elevated to a felony in this case only because the fellow had a prior.             But, besides the misdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony battery statutes in Florida, right?             And how -- how are they defined?             Misdemeanor does?             Right.               You -- you would have to have other States which only have a battery statute that is defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery statute in Florida. If they have a higher degree of battery, just as Florida does, which is a felony, then, if the -- if the prosecutor wants this fellow to be convicted of a violent crime, he -- he could charge him with that -- with that higher degree.               Are there any States that have only this simple battery statute, which is -- which is met by a simple touching?               No. No.          You mistook my question.              Are there any States in which the only prosecution for battery that can be brought is under a statute as broad as this one, which is -- is covered by even a touching?              Don't all of the other States that have a touching statute also have higher degree of battery statutes?              Do they use battery in the statute here?   I am looking for it.                   I don't -- I don't see the word "battery" at all.              Excuse me.       Under 1 it depends upon the elements, but what about 2 and especially the residual provision of 2, "any other conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another"?             I would think rape qualifies under that.            And many of the other crimes that Justice Breyer has been talking about.             I dare say that the next time somebody comes to argue before this Court that a crime is not included within Section 2 because it's not a property crime, I don't think that person is going to get one vote.            I thought you said they all had such -- such aggravated statutes in your answer to me.   Now you just said many of them do.               Which is it?
08-724 +++$+++ 
08-728 +++$+++             I don't understand -- I don't understand the government to be argue -- to be arguing that they are treated differently.            They are saying whoever -- whoever asked for the extension of time in order to prepare the motion gets it.            And -- and it's the time limit's suspended.            Well --              -- they made it very clear here that they think it applies to both the defendant and the government.
08-7412 +++$+++             No sentence can be -- can be imposed rarely?           When a sentence is imposed rarely, it becomes unconstitutional?           That's not your position? What --           It doesn't make it crueler to him.     I don't see why it's any crueler to an adolescent than it is to -- what -- where do you draw the line?     At 21?           And so if it s --          So he -- he could sentence up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of the person in prison?      That -- that would be okay?          Well, what's he supposed to do?   How many years can he give --          -- consecutive?          There obviously does.        What do you propose?   I propose, you know, 1 year before his life expectancy.          Oh, 1 year before life is also unconstitutional?          Two years before life?           I don't think -- the same kind of freedom that people on death row have?             I --          Aren't they released into the general population for exercise, for -- which I don't think death row inmates are.          Well, I doubt whether this varies.   I -- I don't know of any principle where if you are in for life, you are in solitary.            You assume -- doesn't your argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no longer a problem, we should let this person out.          But that isn't the only purpose of punishment that we've acknowledged.    One of the purposes is retribution, punishment for just perfectly horrible actions.          And I don't know why that value of retribution diminishes to the point of zero when it's a person who's, you know, 17 years 9 months old.            Most States didn t -- don't think so, or many States don't think so.          Oh, sure, but you can make that claim in Florida courts, can't you?          Can't you argue in Florida courts that this sentence is disproportionate and violates the Eighth Amendment, whereupon the Florida courts would have to decide?            Wouldn't they have to decide that question?          A line has to be drawn somewhere only if we accept your approach that there has to be a categorical exemption.         A line does not have to be drawn somewhere if you adopt the approach of, case by case, decide whether this is proportional, given how old the individual was, given the nature of the crimes, and all of the other factors.        You don't have to draw a line then, and that's the attraction of that approach.
08-7621 +++$+++            But Roper was decided under a regime, which I -- I think still exists, that death is different.     How could it possibly be thought to apply to this case, which is not a death case?           It said kids are different for purposes of the death penalty, which is different.           No, no.     The only Federal question in the case now -- or at least the preliminary Federal question, the threshold Federal question, is simply whether the State court was right about what Roper did.    And if we agree with the State court about what Roper did, then the State's bar automatically applies and that's the end of the case.           Oh, I don't -- I don't know about that.    We -- is the argument here that, unless Roper mandates this result, you don't urge that the Constitution requires it?        I don't think so.          Well, that's true, but once we analyze the question, if we decide, as the trial court decided, that in fact Roper does not demand the result in this case and, therefore, there is no exception to the procedural bar of Florida, which makes an exception where the fundamental constitutional right asserted was not established within the period provided for, once we decide that in fact Roper didn't establish it, you're out of court, it seems to me. Then -- then, automatically, the -- the procedural bar of Florida applies.           Did -- did you raise below your assertion that the exception -- that there is an exception for challenging -- for vacating sentences, that there is -- that that is an exception to the normal rule of 2 years  limitation?            Did you make that argument below?          All you have established is that there is a consensus that that sentence should be rare, not a consensus that that sentence should not be available, because most States make it available.            There are a lot of murderers who get life without parole.              Not every murderer gets -- gets executed.            So how can you say that these are worst of the worst?             Murderers are the worst of the worst, and they get life without parole.            Call them the "worse of the worse" maybe, but they are not the worst of the worst.             It depends on how horrible the crime is that they've committed, doesn't it?           But you say it doesn't.     It doesn't depend upon how horrible it is and how much retribution society demands.          This is non-homicide.       Six --
08-769 +++$+++               What do you mean by a "for-profit commercial market"?              You mean anything that is sold, right?              Okay.              Well, of course it is.   I mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say, since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity, the means, which is to prevent the communication, is okay.     It is targeting the communication of videos that depict this conduct.            Child -- child pornography is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been treated as part of that same traditional classification which there has always been permission for the government to prohibit.       This is something quite different. I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that bullfights are terrific and we should have them. I would -- I would not be able to -- to market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight is.   Right?    I would be able to talk and say, oh, you should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the most significant point that I want to make, get people to watch it.                Well, wait.       Wait.   I don't understand that.    Any depiction of bullfighting is educational?                And that is true because Congress said so?                Well, I guess a dogfight is educational, too.              So noneducational bullfighting would be prohibited?               If I market this just because I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting?              Okay.        It is covered.              "Or killed."        How do you limit "killed" to cruel -- you say in your brief that it's noscitur ex sociis.        But that's a doctrine that says when you have a string of words, one of which has various meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the words with which it is associated.                 So if you speak of staples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other fasteners, "nails" obviously doesn't mean toenails.                    It means a nail that is a fastener, the word "nail" having various meanings. "Kill" has one meaning, which is kill.                    And you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and other things.   Do you have a single case where -- where that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which on its face is absolutely clear?               What is that?               Exactly.               No, it's not susceptible to a wide -- that's my whole point.                 It means kill.               Some people think eating an animal is animal cruelty.          These people don't eat meat because it is the product of killing animals.              Well, it shouldn't have said that, then.              You don't have a single case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like "kill" is given a more narrow meaning because of other words that are different from that word.                But the first order problem occurs in states where it is not illegal.                      These videos are taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting or cock fighting is entirely legal.                      So, I don't know how you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think that violence in movie brutalizes people and causes violence in people's action. Why couldn't Congress, persuaded by these people say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict torture?   You know, these horror films that come out around Halloween, you can't depict that anymore.                     What is the difference between that and what you have done here?             Who knows.            Is that it?            A different category.     That is traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not protected.    And child pornography, as far as I am concerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned is obscenity.             His message is that getting animals to fight is fun.          That's his message.             To say he -- you know, he can convey that message in some other way, how else does he do it?             Simulated dog fights would be okay under this statute?               I don't understand.   Are you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this country and no market to be dried up, the videos would be okay?               Yeah; but we don't have any human sacrifice.   Nobody's doing that stuff.            So you could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.              How about the statute's term, "kill" --              -- what should that be interpreted to mean?             If you shoot a little low and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you didn't intend that.            But what about your response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter?                 I understand Congress wasn't directed at --
08-810 +++$+++            Right.       But -- but when the administrator has interpreted the plan incorrectly and the court finds -- the court of appeals finds that he has interpreted it incorrectly, it doesn't have to send it back and say, you know:              Give me another bid; try something else.     It says:           You did it incorrectly, and we find that what you should have done is this. Isn't that what normally happens?           So all a court can do in those trust cases is to say:              You've got it wrong, Sam; go back and do it again.              Right?           And he gets it wrong again, and he goes back to court; the court says:              Sam, it's still wrong; go back and do it again.           I can't believe that that's what the law is.           Well, why -- this is important to me, whether the plan administrator was interpreting the same language when this case was remanded back down.     Originally, he was simply applying the methodology that had been specified in 1990, right?           And the court said that was no good because you didn't give these people notice of it.   But that -- he had been applying that test not since 1990, but since 1980.           In other words, he had taken that to be a reasonable interpretation of the very summary language in -- in the plan itself, right?           So when it went back, why didn't he stick with that and say:                 Yes, they didn't have adequate notice of that, but that is still a reasonable interpretation of the original plan, even before we specified that.           Yes.           I understand that.          Why did he do that?   Inasmuch as the first interpretation was not adopted in 1990, but it was adopted under the same language that he is now interpreting in 1980, right? He was applying it between 1980 and 1990.                 That's what he thought he -- that's what he thought the plan meant in all those years.           After 1990.           Oh, I didn't understand.     I didn't understand it.           Well, your -- your brief says:   "The Plan Administrator has consistently applied the reconstructed account methodology since the early '80s."           "Effective April '90" -- "1990, the Plan language requiring this methodology provided as follows."        So I took that to mean there was no such language before that?           There was plan language requiring it before 1990.           Okay.           Okay.      That's -- that's what I thought, and I thought you said no when I asked that question, that this detailed description of the RAM didn't come in until 1990.           Oh -- oh, I see.           I got you.           So you claim -- you claim that what he is interpreting when it comes back to him is not the same text that they invalidated --           -- but rather it's the plan without this text.           The court of appeals said it s just an application of equitable principles --   -- not an interpretation of the plan.           Yes, yes.           One -- well, I thought you said what this affects is just the floor; it doesn't affect the level of the -- of the defined contribution.           But the court of appeals held that this one was inadequate because it did not say that you were going to take into account the time value of money.   If that's the reason it held that this one was bad, the same reason would apply to the plain vanilla.
08-861 +++$+++           When you say "no existing mechanism," could the SEC adopt a rule that would give the SEC authority to -- to stop it?          Well, I m --          I'm not sure that's the main point.    I think the main -- the main point is whether the FCC could stop it -- the SEC could stop it if it wanted to.          Never mind "Right now, it cannot."   If it issued a rule that said you need our approval --          It cannot issue such a rule?          Why not?           Well, why -- why isn't this simply relieving the board of responsibility, saying, you no longer have responsibility for -- for investigation and inspection in these areas?           They could do that, couldn't they?           Well, let's talk about whether it can't or not.      Why can't it?          Don't -- don't you think that's what it means, though, realistically?          When you no longer have responsibility to perform a government -- governmental act, you no longer have authority to perform it.             I don't think the government will think it has achieved a great victory if it comes out of this with the proposition that the SEC is not an independent regulatory agency.              And I don't think the government is arguing that position.            "For cause" doesn't mean for failure to obey the President's instructions, does it?            That's why it's called an independent regulatory agency, because it's not subject to presidential control.          I d love to say that. That would be wonderful.          This is not an argument you have made anyway.     Can we go on to the arguments that you ve made?          Thank you.             I hope your case doesn't rest on Freytag. (Laughter.)          I don't understand that. It's okay for them to appoint principal officers, but not inferior officers?          Oh.    Oh, I see.             I wish you had said that. You really had me scared there. (Laughter.)             You re saying they are not inferior officers and also not principal officers, but merely employees?             And who appoints -- who appoints the inferior officers at the -- at the SEC?             All those appointments are presumably invalid.             That would be a shame.           Say it again --           We don't assume that they -
08-876 +++$+++                You -- you don't ask for the first, do you?                 The problem with the bribe or kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend, unlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute for limiting it to that.             I mean, we -- we can't find a statute that says, "No person shall commit a bad act." We can't find that to be non-vague as applied to murder. Everybody knows that murder is a bad act.               Would that -- would that law be constitutional?             Mr. Estrada, let -- let me pursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the problem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that there is nothing in the text of the statute that would enable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes. Is there anything in the text of the statute that makes your proposal any better? I mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make this a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require injury to somebody.      But it defined a new kind of fraud, namely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest services.   That's the fraud.           That, in and of itself, under the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.            What if -- what if I think that even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to the point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to avoid constitutional problems. What if I think you don't avoid constitutional problems?            Why should -- why should I turn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the interpretation that you want?             Now, what about --
08-88 +++$+++                   I guess when -- when the last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had expired, I suppose the court could have refused to permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?                  Couldn't it say you -- you have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation, and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you -- you stay in the case?                  Does it make it not the State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what? Is -- is the court's misfeasance the State's misfeasance?    Do you attribute that to the State?              Ms. Rainville, you -- you began your presentation with a statement that gave me so much hope.    You said you were going to give us three reasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts of the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law. Okay?   You only mentioned the first.                     What are the other two?              Remind us of the first.                Well, that sort of gets us into the facts at some point.              I mean, that does get us into the facts. What's the third?              What would you think of a rule that said where most of the delay is attributable to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk?            That seems like a reasonable rule.            Whatever the delay is, if most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?              That would make it easy to decide this case because the -- the supreme court's opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the delay was caused by the defendant.
08-905 +++$+++               But you want to go beyond constructive discovery?              Well, I think there s a line between constructive discovery -- constructive discovery asks, when should you have known?            And the rule you are arguing for is something beyond that.              Under your rule, what happens when you are put on inquiry notice?            That's the point at which you should be conducting additional investigation, right?           And that's where the -- statute begins to run, at the point when you should have conducted additional investigation?           Yes.           Okay.           All right.           Well, excuse me.       To --           To say that, you must believe that there is substantial evidence of fraud when there is simply substantial evidence of inaccuracy, without --           -- without any evidence of scienter.     What evidence of scienter was there?            Well, but deliberate wrongdoing -- as I understood that, it was simply you didn't give adequate weight to the -- to the other -- to the other side of it.            That means it's -- that means it's wrong.    You can misrepresent something without having scienter to defraud.          Mr. Shanmugam, in Lampf we -- we had to choose between what statute of limitations provision, Federal one, we thought applied.           And we had two choices:     One was section 77m, which reads:         After such discovery  -- "after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence." That was one choice. The other choice was 78i(e), which simply said:   "unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation.            No statement of "or after it should have been made by the exercise," okay?     We chose the latter in Lampf. Now, you are telling me that there was no choice between the two, that -- that "after discovery" always means after discovery was made or after it should have been made?     What were we doing in Lampf, spinning our wheels?          I mean, I read this -- this statute -- and 1658 tracks, not 77m, which says "after discovery should have been made"; it tracks 78i(e), which says "after discovery."          Now, to me that means after discovery, period.          Well, just tell me what the difference it was between 77m and 77i(e)?          What was the difference, unless it was that 77m -- I'm sorry, 78i(e) -- absolutely required knowledge?           So there was no difference between the two --           -- and we were just wasting our time?
08-911 +++$+++            How does that -- how does that read?    I -- I recall the briefs say that, but I don't recall reading it.        Is it -- does it appear somewhere?           The -- the provision that -- that you contend provides the authority for the Attorney General's regulation.           I know.       Where is it, I'm asking?    Is it -- is it in the briefs somewhere? You know, it's nice to know what we are talking about.    When -- when you are relying on a section, it would be nice to have it in the materials. I mean, I guess I can send for it, but --          So it really doesn't matter what "under" means, right?           I mean, even -- even if you accept the other interpretation of "under," to wit, that it includes regulations pursuant to the subchapter, your point is that this regulation is not even pursuant to the subchapter.          I understand.       Yes.           Why -- why would it -- I don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is that it doesn't make any sense. Why would Congress want to exclude review for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney General is given the authority to make them discretionary and has done so? I mean, a discretionary judgment is a discretionary judgment.        Why -- at least if it's a legitimate one.     I can understand why you would say discretion which is given to the Attorney General under the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute? One is explicit in the statute, and the other is pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to make it discretionary. Why would Congress want the one to be subject to judicial review and not the other?           Yes, and I'm saying why is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised, since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it.              That makes some sense. And I -- but where discretion is lawfully exercised, why would -- why would Congress say, oh, when the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not allow it?     I don't understand why -- why it would want to do that.          Okay.          Well, you -- you don't -- you don't contest that the regulation can provide discretion.     You -- you don't say the regulation is invalid.          So it is a valid exercise of discretion, right?          Sure.
08-9156 +++$+++                 Of course, if they had introduced that evidence on behalf of the defendant, there would have come in the report they had gotten from -- who was it, Dr. Kirkland?                  Was that his name?                 Which said that, although he -- he indeed was in the lower range of mental agility, this did not affect his ability to discern right from wrong.                 He was not -- the Kirkland report was not a favorable report for the defendant.                 Well, but it didn't just say borderline intellectual function.                    It went on to say that did not affect his ability to perceive that he was -- he was doing something wrong here.             You know, if it had not added that I would have said, oh, yeah, let's -- let's pursue this further.      But they -- it seems to me they made an intelligent decision There was nothing here that was going to help them and there might be stuff that would hurt them.            No, no, no.       It resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of facts.            It focuses on the decision, whether the decision could have been reached --            -- without the use of any facts that had been found to be false.
08-964 +++$+++              Of course, the government says that the -- that the term on which it hangs its hat is the term  useful arts  and that that meant, originally, and still means manufacturing arts, arts dealing with workmen, with -- you know, inventors, like Lorenzo Jones, not -- not somebody who writes a book on how to win friends and influence people. What s wrong with that analysis, that that's what "useful arts" meant, that it always -- always was thought to deal with machines and inventions?          Even though the public can't use it, right, until the patent expires?          You know, you mention that there are all these -- these new areas that didn't exist in the past because of modern business and whatnot, but there are also areas that existed in the past that don't exist today.     Let's take training horses.        Don't you think that -- that some people, horse whisperers or others, had some, you know, some insights into the best way to train horses?        And that should have been patentable on your theory.          Well, why didn't anybody patent those things?          You would really have thought somebody would have patented that.          How old -- how old were those -- those cases?          Well, it was -- it was transforming sound into electrical current and then at the other end electrical current back into sound.                   I mean it met the transformation test, didn't it?          It clearly did.          Sound -- sound is not physical, and electric current is not physical?          Yes, I think so.          Sound is, too.          Sound is not transmitted over the wires.     Sound has been transformed into current, and current is transmitted over the wire and then transformed back at the other end into sound.           I think it clearly -- clearly would have been covered by -- by the test the government --
08-969 +++$+++              There is no such adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no such adjective as "choate."             There is "inchoate," but the opposite of "inchoate" is not "choate."             Any more than the -- I don't know. (Laughter.)             Exactly.        Yes.   It's like "gruntled."             Exactly.        "Disgruntled" and the opposite of "disgruntled" is "gruntled."              So why is this different? I mean, it's clear that "property" can mean that.            You acknowledge that it can mean the government's entitlement to money from taxes?              So it can mean that.     Now why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?              Is the word "property" used in the antitrust laws?              What does it say?                 And it -- and it's clear that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does not include the government's entitlement to income from taxes?             Yes, but that -- that's something different.        This isn't just the general, you know, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the State.     Here, what they're saying is:                 You caused people who owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of money.             Well, it might have been inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that, I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they?                   I mean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward. Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?             So worry about that later. I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that are very clear do not constitute property.            That's a different issue.            You're going to talk about that one, aren't you?            You've got it.              What is it, a user tax once it gets into the city?            Like automobiles.            Just like automobiles.      If you buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the State sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you have to pay a use tax.            And that's all it was alleged that these websites said, "tax-free"?              They said "tax-free"?            "Sales are tax-free." That's very clever.            No -- "no tobacco tax"?            But there is a tobacco tax, isn't there?    Don't you -- wouldn't you call that use tax a tax on tobacco?            Are there any sanctions for failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own, without having to go through RICO?            Isn't there some exemption, anyway, for a couple of cartons?            For what, two cartons?               It would probably cost them more to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't you think, to sue individual citizens after they get the names?             So you get half-treble damages.     What is that?      One-and-a-half damages.             But for -- no, no, your response is, but for, plus foreseeable, is not a definition of proximate cause.             You need more than that.                Well, that's wrong.       I mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though there is an intervening criminal act. Now, maybe what you want to argue is that that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as -- such as RICO.     That would be a reasonable argument.
08-970 +++$+++             What is similar -- what is similar work?           Okay.           Well, that has nothing to do with the -- with the quality of the representation, does it?           Why didn't it name those factors as -- as the determinative factors, instead of saying, and therefore they should get more money for quality?           Okay.        They advanced -- they advanced money for experts --          -- during the case.     The contingency, which we rejected as a -- as a basis. And what was the third one?          They weren't paid on --          Isn't that -- isn't that the same as contingency?            Well, I suppose the question under the statute is whether it would be a reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to determine that is to ask whether it would be considered reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another $10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy, he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner.          So we are going to -- we are billing him at the $500 rate, instead of the $200.     Would -- would that be considered a reasonable attorney's fee?               I didn t think so.          Or, indeed, you don't know that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the matter.   Presumably it does.           It's so great when it comes to him, he doesn't have to do much work.          You are saying we can never exceed the lodestar amount?           I mean, we have said in some cases that in extraordinary circumstances it can. What are those extraordinary circumstances, or do you think there are none?          Such as?       That's what I'm asking.          What are you referring to, if not attorney performance?           You think that s what we had in mind, huh?   You think that s what we had in mind when we said they are extraordinary circumstances?           -- but I would never have thought of it, and I doubt whether we did. (Laughter.)            Well, I mean, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. (Laughter.)
08-974 +++$+++           There s an independent violation without an impact?            I mean, it's not the impact provision that you quoted which makes that a violation.   It must be some other provision that makes it a violation.   What other provision is it?          Right.          Sure.          Well, that s because of an impending violation.          And that would be clear even though it had not been established much earlier that the test was invalid.        So a city could go along using a test that was an invalid test, not declared such; 10 years later, somebody comes up and says:         This test that is being applied to me is an invalid test.          What -- of what use is a statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates that way?
08-992 +++$+++              Where is that?          I mean, why do we have to guess about it?             Where -- where do you find that in its opinion?          Because I have -- I have the same -- the same problem.             What -- what about his -- his colleague who broke out with him?                    How do you -- how do you explain that.
08-998 +++$+++              There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to.                 You say that one - one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move for a revision of the confirmed plan.             What constrains the judge in allowing or not allowing the revision?                 Doesn't he have the same kind of discretion with regard to the revision that you're objecting to with regard to his establishing the payments?             But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and then you have to show that there were some extraordinary circumstances that justify a change.                    I don't see that there's any difference.             What your case comes down to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the plan initially but by revising it.             Maybe?             That was a friendly question.             Can I -             Can I come back to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan? Because as you say, the plan here would not have been confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always.               I mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the preceding 6 months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to have that -- that amount of money, there would be the opportunity to adjust.             In other words, is your response to Justice Ginsburg "always," that it will always be the case that where there would be an adjustment under this theory, there would not have been a confirmation in the first place?                Can I ask -- yes, there is one more question.                Can I ask whether 1323, which you have now invoked, does not provide the same kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting to? What -- what standards are there for granting or not granting modification of the plan?                   Is it pretty much up to the judge?              Well, then -- then -- okay. You are between a rock and a hard place.                  Either 1323 gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said, it's one way out, or it isn't.               Which is it?             Okay.        So any -- any amendment has to relate to a period -             -- subsequent to the filing.
09-10245 +++$+++        Can a -- can a sentencing judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives no -- no particular reason for that?     Would that be appealed as an invalid sentence?       Well -       Let -- let me ask my question a different way.     In deciding whether to approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to consider whether it is an application of the guidelines, whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines, whether it does not take into account valid reasons for departure from the guidelines?       Then, if that's the case, then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines, every single one, because the judge always has to consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea agreement.       Incidentally, and it sort of bears upon this discussion, are the guidelines mandatory when they are applied in approving a plea agreement?     In other words, does Booker/Fanfan not apply to the application of the guidelines when a judge is - is approving a plea agreement?     Do you think the guidelines are mandatory in that situation?       But Justice Alito's hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's no reason to believe that the government is interested in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in putting this person away for a certain amount of time, especially when another count is dropped and the government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years.     But if the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he is only going for a year and a half or a year, the agreement might not have been concluded.     So it really -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both parties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed, the agreement changes.
09-1036 +++$+++        Gee, I thought Bowles was a nice, clear case.     I mean, you can always find some distinction in the next case, and I thought the object of Bowles was to say if it's a -- if it's a limit on appeal, it's jurisdictional.     That would -- and that's, I gather, what the Federal Circuit took it to mean.     And I would have done that if I was down there, probably.       But doesn't -- doesn't the Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an appeal, does it?     It talks of a civil action.       I mean, you're right that -- you know, that there is -- there is a parallel in what's going on, but the statute does not call it an appeal.     It calls it bringing a civil action -       -- to challenge their decision.       You -- so -       Go on.       Although that -- although that would happen when he appeals from the -- from the veterans' appeals court, right?       But this one, to get to the Veterans Court, is 120 days, which is a lot of time.     Do you know of any other time limit that is that long?       No, for appeal.     For appeal.       Do you know of any other appeal statute that -       Well, the latter I can understand, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for -- I mean, when he loses below, he gets a notice that says specifically he has to file an appeal with this court, doesn't it?     Doesn't it say that?       So he sends it -- he sends it to the VA instead of to this court?       Would equitable tolling even cover that situation?     It would seem to me -- I'd say it told you where to file; you simply didn't follow the instructions.       Where is that?     Is that -       They don't navigate it entirely unassisted.     I mean, isn't there usually assistance from a nongovernmental organization such as the American Legion or -       That's right, but do they -- do they drop them like a hot potato once the VA portion is over?     They don't counsel about how to file an appeal?       And you think normally he isn't assisted -- he is not assisted by one of these people?       Well -       I'm not talking about a lawyer; I'm talking about advice from somebody at -- in the American Legion.       So whenever we have time limits in the future that do not contain any -- any explicit provision for waiver of failure to meet those time limits, you're asking us to find that all of those are non-jurisdictional?       Well, is it a filing requirement?     It's -- it's a -       It's an appeal.     It's a requirement for appeal. Whenever there is an appeal deadline that does not have an exception for -- you know, you -- you can get it extended for 10 days or whatnot -- whenever there's no exception, you want us to hold it's not jurisdictional?       Although you're willing to -- to allow that happen when there's an appeal from -- from the first appeal, right?       Well, why give them notice? I mean, isn't the very giving of -- of notice -       -- an indication that they are expected to do something?
09-10876 +++$+++        What about police witnesses?     What about not requiring the officer who - who took the confession or who witnessed the alleged crime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy?       Can't make it.     He's out on the beat.     So can we have him appear by television?       Why -- why is a lab technician different?       The State takes its chances, right?     I mean, as to how much it has to bring in, in order to persuade the jury?       Does not Melendez-Diaz also say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his intention to make that challenge, or his intention to make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the State will know whether it has to introduce any live testimony?       Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford. Wasn't the same worry raised in Crawford?       Said, yes, it may be something of a risk, but the States have managed it in the past, and there's no reason to think they can't manage it in the future.       Wasn't it the case that these tests are unusual in this particular jurisdiction?       Well, I assume that even if he doesn't remember, his testimony is not worthless to the prosecution.     He -- the prosecution can bring out his high qualifications, and he can testify:     It -- this is always the way I do it.     I do it this way all the time.     I don't remember this particular incident. All of that can be persuasive to the jury, can't it?       Not under oath, though, that's the only difference?
09-1088 +++$+++        Is that where the 6 and a half hours came from?       His records -       Which the California court had.       So it's not new evidence, then.     It wasn't new evidence before the Federal court.       If you're relying on allegations rather than the evidence, the allegation was even worse.     The allegation was zip.       No time.       Well, exactly, that doesn't help you.
09-11121 +++$+++        Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not clear on what you are proposing.     Is there to be one different Miranda requirement rule for all minors, or is there to be one for, what, 20-year-olds, 19-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 17, 16?     This one is 13, do we calibrate it that finely -       -- or do we just say, you know, what would a minor -- I don't know, a general minor regard as restrictions upon his departure?       I understand that.       So you mean 15, 14, 13, 1/2?     Right?       It's not -- if not calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?       Common sense?       And -- and -- and how - how is the law enforcement officer going into the confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or whatever?       Do you think that's clear?       What about mental deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors, deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as well?     Is there any -- any basis in principle for not -- I mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that it is a subjective inquiry whether the particular individual regarded him or herself as being in custody; isn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing?       No?     Why is age different from mental deficiency, for example?       You could say both of those things about the mentally deficient.     They may regard themselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have cognitive deficiencies.       Even -- even if you said no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis for treating a childhood any differently from these other factors.     So basically you're saying Justice Breyer would call it objective circumstances.     You know, whether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the subjective condition of the -- of the person being held in custody.     And I think, I don't think that's what we meant by the phrase "objective circumstances." But you want objective circumstances to include the character of the person being held in custody, whether he's mentally deficient, whether he's schizophrenic, known to the police, you know, whatever factors, right?     Those are all objective circumstances?       We need empirical data for that?       We need empirical data for that?       To show that -       -- the closer to adulthood a child is, the more like an adult he is? (Laughter.)       When the policeman sees him, he's dressed in baggy jeans, you know, down around his thighs, and when the judge sees him he's wearing a Buster Brown jumper suit.     You don't really think that it's going to be equivalent?       What if the parent tells them not to leave?     What if the parent says, you go and talk to this police officer?     If you did something wrong, I want them to know about it; talk to the officer.       No, no.     They're not an agent; they're acting as a parent.       Are you answering my question?       Is there a good faith -       Does a good faith mistake make it okay?     If, you know, the officer, in good faith, believes that it's not a minor and -- and proceeds accordingly?
09-11311 +++$+++        What's in between?       So we can assume that the conviction here did not involve any risk of bodily injury to anybody?       Right.       I don't drive in Indiana. I think that's pretty tough.       How can you say somebody is fleeing?     I mean, doesn't fleeing mean you're trying to escape the -- the officer?       And I -- I don't know how we could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in fact a majority of the cases that come into this first relatively harmless category did indeed involve situations that involved physical risk because, as everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's probably very often the case that the defendant is charged only under -- under category 1, where, you know, if he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't that so?       Yes, yes.     You want to say "yes." (Laughter.)       I presume that if -       And it may well be that in deciding whether to accept a plea bargain of being guilty of (A) rather than going to trial on (B), if your client has two violent felonies already on the book, you might take -- take the plea bargain under (A) lest you run afoul of the violent felony act.       I don't understand your answer to that question.     I would have thought that your answer, if you're insisting on a categorical approach, would be "no," that there's nothing in -- in (3) that requires any violence at all.     Just fleeing by visible or audible means, just -- just flees.     That's all it says.       That's a good question.       I suppose that if we agreed with you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon what other prosecutions for fleeing could have been brought.     If we agree with you that (1)(A) is negligible because there are other bigger ones for which he wasn't charged, we could leave open the question of what - what happens in a State that has only one crime for fleeing, and we would -- then we would have to confront the question that Justice Sotomayor has asked. But if we accept your notion that -- where you have a gradation that is adopted by the State, the lowest gradation cannot be determined to have a high percentage of bodily risk, right?
09-11328 +++$+++        Excuse me.     You lose me in the argument because it doesn't seem to me that we -- if we did apply the good faith rule, we would be denying retroactive effect to the altered judgment.     It continues to apply to matters beforehand, but it's a totally different question whether, assuming it is retroactive, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies.     It's a -- it's a separate question from retroactivity, it seems to me.       It's not a label at all. You're -- we're not denying the application of the altered rule to your client's conduct.     It applies.     But the question of whether, when it does apply, the good faith disregard of it by a police officer nonetheless allows the evidence to be admitted, it's a totally different -- we're giving full retroactive effect to the -- to the change in the law.       Mr. Kerr, I've been on the bench 30 years or so now.     I have never, never heard counsel come before the court and say that we should overrule a case without making the argument:     The facts of this case are not within the prior decision anyway. It just doesn't happen.       There was still not the argument you should overrule the prior case, period, with no effort to show why you could come out that way without overruling the prior cases.     I just don't know -       I'm saying they're nonexistent.     I'm not saying they're rare.
09-115 +++$+++        Why -- why is that a problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and the State statutes require, you have to show an intent to hire an unauthorized worker?     Isn't -- isn't that what the State statutes here require?       Right.       So -- so why is that a problem for -- for the business?     I mean he's safe so long as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized worker.       Well, I think what Arizona would answer to that is:     Well, that's the only option the Federal Government left us.       They excluded everything else.     We might have used reticulated penalties or, you know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they forbade that.     But they did allow us to enforce the law, immigration laws, through licensing, right?     So it all essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue, doesn't it?       That would be possible only because nobody would think that, with this scheme in place, the Federal Government would not enforce it.     Of course, no one would have expected that.     But what Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other States are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration.     And, therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it to occur under this statute, but expectations change when the Federal Government has -- has simply not enforced the immigration restrictions.       It could have named that, if that's all it meant.       It could have named that, that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it meant.     But it didn't name it; it said licensing generally. What did it intend to add to that?     Barbers' licenses?       Beauticians' licenses?       How would any of this have anything to do with the immigration laws?       But they're saying - that's exactly what they are saying.     We -- we have -       I think it's very common to talk about authority to do business within a State as - as a license.     You say "licensed to do business in" so many States.     It's a common expression. Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law limits the authority to do business within the State, it is a -- it is a licensing law.     It's a little harder extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but when you issue a corporation charter you really do two things.     You create the corporation and enable the limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you authorize that new creature to do business within your State.     So at least half of that corporation law is licensing, it seems to me. Now, if that's what I think, what -       Yes.     Go on.       You -- but you do not need the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation needs -   -- if you're an in-State corporation.       Excuse me.     Don't depart from that.     What does that mean, "enforcement shall be uniform"?       What does that mean, "enforcement shall be uniform"?       Is that any different from -       -- from what is the assumed situation with respect to all Federal laws?       Are Federal laws not to be applied uniformly.       I don't see the problem in -- in diverse adjudication.     Wouldn't there be a Federal question presented if a -- if a company claimed that it was deprived of the ability to do business because of a mistaken interpretation of Federal law, that the person it hired was not an authorized person?       Wouldn't that be a Federal question that -- that could be -       Doesn't the State law basis refer to the Federal law?       I thought it tracked it.       Excuse me.     You -- are you saying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been saying as well, that if you have a licensing law that permits the revocation of the license, the revocation is not a licensing law?       Suppose I have a licensing law which says if you do this, your license will be revoked.     Does that remain a licensing law?       Why make exception for licensing laws therefore if you can't revoke a license under it?       Once you're in, you can do whatever you like.     Do you think that is what Congress meant?     You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when you issue the license, but once its issued, they can do whatever they like; is that right?       And revocation.     Okay.     So that raises the question:     What does it make -- why does it make any difference if the revocation provision is contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a general State law which says all licenses that -- that are issued may be revoked for certain reasons?       So they should just -- Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to require what they now require when the license is issued, and to say, in each specific licensing law, that it can be revoked for the same -- on the same grounds -       That would solve the problem.       Would you -       -- read that section again?       No, no, that's all right.       Convicted by -- by a Federal Government that hasn't gone after many convictions.       That's the whole problem.
09-11556 +++$+++        Was -- was -- was the poisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous fruit the fact that this person who is contained in the records was the one driving the car?     Why wasn't that the -- why wasn't that the fruit?     I mean, the records were there anyway.     What -- what -- what new information came from the stop was the fact that that is the person who was driving the car.     Why -- why didn't -- why wasn't that what should have been suppressed?       I would agree with you on that fruit.     Did -- did you ask for that to be suppressed?       But that's not what's before us here, right?       Not -- not if you allow the suppression of the policeman's identification of the individual driving the car.     I mean, that -- nobody's contending that that can't be suppressed.     So if you can't bring in the policeman to say, yes, this fellow Smith, whose record we have here, was the fellow driving the car.     Once that's out, what incentive is there to make these suspicionless stops?       What I'm saying is, you're getting at it from the wrong end.     What should have been suppressed was the policeman's identification of the person who was driving the car.       Well, it -- it gets you nowhere to say John Smith.     You have to say John Smith was driving the car.     It's the driving of the car that you want suppressed.     That's not the identity.     I mean, John Smith, fine, you can say John Smith, John Smith, John Smith all you like at court.     It's -- it's not going to get a conviction. But when you say John Smith was driving the car, then you are eliciting testimony from the officer concerning information he would not have had but for the stop, that John Smith was driving the car, right?
09-1156 +++$+++        Mr. Hacker, the complaint did not rely exclusively upon these adverse incidents but also referred to a -- a study, a report by researchers at the American Rhinologic Society -       -- which -- which asserted that there was a connection.       So the -- is the question before us simply whether in isolation the adverse incidents would be enough, or is not the question whether those adverse incidents placed next to this study would be enough?       Why didn't they say that?       Well, I thought the - you're saying the complaint did not refer to the study?       Mr. Hacker, suppose Good Morning America made the same claim, categorically saying that this drug caused this condition, but did so simply on the basis of these adverse incidents, and they didn't have Dr. Janner's, or whatever his name is, reports, but nonetheless Good Morning America comes out, and on the basis of those incidents, saying Zicam causes whatever the condition is.     Would that have to be reported?       And if not, why not?       All right.     That's -       Fine.       These are unreasonable investors who are relying on some talking head on Good Morning America who says that this is true -       -- even though it isn't true.       No -       You haven't answered yes or no.     There's no basis for its being said on Good Morning America, but unreasonable investors by the thousands rely upon it.       No -       Don't -       Of course, if I may interject -       -- the FDA acts in the public interest, doesn't it?       And it doesn't make money by withdrawing a drug from the market.       As opposed to somebody who sues, who makes money on the lawsuit.
09-1159 +++$+++        Just -- just as a hypothetical, suppose -- suppose it was as Justice Ginsburg suggested; or indeed suppose this individual even before he was employed by Stanford at all, much less employed by a Stanford project funded by the Federal Government, entered into this kind of an agreement with somebody that he had been working for. How -- how would it -       How does that change when you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as an employee of Stanford when he was at this other company?     You could still say that -- that Stanford was not the inventor.       Plus the word "retained," don't forget that, too.       But this isn't vesting it in the United States.     This is -- this is speaking of the -- the university retaining title.     If -- if the government was going to make such a huge change from normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set forth clearly?     All they needed was one paragraph.       It says when you're working on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no right to your invention as an -- as an employee.     It automatically vests in the -- in the university.     I would have expected that to be set forth very clearly if -- if they were making such an immense change in patent law.       Excuse me.     I lost you.     Go over that again.       Yes, where is that?       Got you.       I don't understand that. Why can't the Federal government just say:     We're not going to fund your project unless you get assignments of inventions by all the employees working on it?     What's the problem?       And by -- and by the Federal 0 voluntary decision to provide funds.     I mean, certainly you can condition your grant of funds on that. I -- I really don't see the problem.
09-1163 +++$+++        Well, you had a different Congress.     I mean, the Congress that passed the law is not necessarily the same Congress that -- that failed to amend the law.     Are we to consider laws to be in effect only for so long as the Congress that passed them is sitting, and then the failure to make any changes in light of judicial decisions by later Congresses effectively amends the law?       That's an extraordinary proposition.       -- but there could be an infinitude of reasons why a law is not passed.       Do you know of any case in which the failure of Congress to amend a law in order to overrule a court decision other than a decision of this Court has been held to be an implicit approval of that decision?     Do we have a single case where we've said, oh, there was a line of court of appeals cases, and since Congress failed to amend the statute to take account of those court of appeals cases, Congress must have approved them.     Do we have any case like that?       I don't know of any.       Mr. Mann, I thought you disagreed with the premise of Justice Ginsburg's question; that is, that you assert that the language related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency is quite clear.       I thought maybe you were abandoning that.
09-1205 +++$+++        Of course, you -- you would say that the subsequent plaintiff is not bound if he was not given notice and an opportunity to opt out, even if he came back to the same court, right? It would be a stupid thing to do.       And he's probably going to lose, but you'd say he's not bound, right?
09-1227 +++$+++        Well, it seems to me there are certainly some arguments you could make as a defendant for which you have no standing.     You're saying there's no argument you can make as a defendant for which you have no standing?       Suppose I raise an Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that does not involve legislation and which our recent opinions say therefore does not violate the Establishment Clause?       No, you wouldn't.     All you -- all you would have to know is that the claim is based upon a statute -- is not based upon a statute and that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence says if it's not based upon a statute, it doesn't violate the Establishment Clause.       I'd say it's a Free Exercise Clause violation.     I don't think you need the Establishment Clause for that.       But that's a merits question rather than a standing question.     I assume we're not getting into those merits questions here.       All right.     But you're confusing me.     I thought we were just doing standing.       Well, why couldn't you have said the same thing in TVA, that, while companies are - are -- not -- yes, the Federal -- the Federal statute requires the companies to charge this price, but they might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and therefore you have no standing?       Why isn't standard standing doctrine able to give you the protection that you're looking after?     If indeed you can't tell whether the State did it because it was compelled to or because it wanted to, there was no causation and you don't have standing.       I would rather use that route of analysis than inventing the new one that you're -- that you're urging upon us.       Well, then let's use the one we already have and -- and not -- not have to get into developing one that I've never heard of before.       You're trying to drive vinegar out of the interstate market?     Do the people know you're trying to do this?     Can you really argue that this statute is designed to drive vinegar out of the interstate market?
09-1233 +++$+++        But don't be rhetorical.
09-1272 +++$+++        Well, that's what -       It might just be somebody going to the toilet, right? (Laughter.)       So, you have to suspect that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is trying to get rid of evidence.     And in order for that to be the case, you have to have smelled the marijuana?       Would the policemen have been able to do anything just because they had smelled marijuana?       Oh, yes, but they'd say Oh, heck, no, you can't come in -       -- do you have a warrant?       So basically the -- the police were taking advantage of the stupidity of the criminals; is that right?       That's terrible.     That's not fair, is it?       Well, after -- after they've heard the -- the movement inside or the flushing or whatever.     You can't just kick it in because you've smelled marijuana.     You -- can you do it, because you - you knock on the door because you smell marijuana, nobody answers, and you kick the door in?       Yes, but without that noise.     Just -       No, of course not.       Why -- why not?     I mean people -- you know, when there's a knock on -- on the door, is the normal human reaction to walk into the other room and shut the door?       I mean, that's peculiar behavior, isn't it?       Is that a common experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?       I don't recall it ever happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow and people open the door. (Laughter.)       They could say "Go away." They could do a lot of stuff.     But walk in the other room and shut the door?       Strange.       You don't know that they're destroying evidence unless you have reason to believe that there is contraband inside.     I mean, the -- the hypothetical is an unrealistic one.     They knock on the door, and somebody moves inside -- that doesn't give them any exigency -       Okay.     They -       Well, that's a different hypothetical.       There's a hypothetical in which they knock on every door under which they smell marijuana.       Perfectly okay?       It wouldn't technically be a Fourth Amendment violation, would it, if the police gave the impression that they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door?     Is that a Fourth Amendment violation in and of itself?       So your -- the -- the unlawfulness test would not prevent that then?       It would not prevent it?       Oh, whoa.     Maybe we have to come up with an unreasonable test, then.       Oh, it's perfectly okay for officers to do that?     To pretend that they have a warrant and "Open the door or we'll kick it in" - that's perfectly okay?       But why?     You say that what they've done is not unlawful.     Why would it be suppressed?
09-1273 +++$+++        Private enforcement.       Ms. Blatt, you said that there's not a whole lot of difference between your position and the Government's.     What is the difference between your position and the Government's?       That doesn't make much sense, does it?       What did the manufacturer promise in exchange for a contract?     You do need consideration.     What did they promise that they weren't already obliged to do by law?       Is this a contract with the Secretary or a contract with the United States executed on behalf of the United States by the Secretary?       On behalf of the -       It's in the name of the Secretary?
09-1279 +++$+++        Our cases assert, do they not, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly construed?       And we've said that on a number of cases.       I don't understand that. We're not putting a thumb on the scale.     Taking account of the fact that -- that Congress has many objectives in any legislation and that the limitations are as important as the -- the substantive end, nonetheless, when, having applied all of that, you end up with, gee, I don't know, it's ambiguous -- you say, even in that situation, we don't apply the rule that -       Well, but that's what ambiguity means.     It does -- it means -       Okay.     The Government wants to abandon the principle that we've set forth in our cases -       -- that exceptions to FOIA are to be narrowly construed.     The Government does not support that.       Even though we did?     I mean -       I'm happy to leave you where you put yourself.       Excuse me.     To go back to the Chief's question, you do not deny that the individuals who form the corporation, the officers and the employees, are protected by the right of personal privacy, and, indeed, you will -- you will edit any FOIA responses to protect those individuals, even though there are many of them, right?       But as individuals, not as -- not as the corporation.
09-1298 +++$+++        Yes, but then you go on to say:     Moreover, give us -- give us the payment for the additional money beyond the 1.35 that you've already given us -       -- plus this additional money that we've expended.       Well, why shouldn't we? I mean, it -- it seems to me if -- if, indeed, you say the government has come up with a defense that makes it impossible to decide who's in the right here -       -- why don't we just -- you know, I think the usual course taken by courts would be to leave the parties where they are.     The matter can't be litigated.     That would mean you would keep your $1.35 billion, but you wouldn't be entitled to sue for the additional amount.     If -- if you were that worried, you should have -- you -- you should have had more frequent progress payments or something. Why don't we just leave you where you are, both you and the government, assuming we agree with you on all the rest?       Yes, you would be 1.35 billion - (Laughter.)       With interest.     I forgot the interest.       But the government didn't do that.     I mean, you're making it up.     The government didn't terminate for convenience.     The government claimed you're in default.     Why would -- why should we force that down the government's throat when we can no more say that the government's wrong than we can say that you're wrong?       It seems to me you call the game off.       Yes, but -       -- the fallacy is we're not -- assuming we agree with you on the rest, we're not saying that it's not a default termination.     We're saying we don't know.       We're saying we don't know. We don't know what the state-secrets thing is.     The government is entitled to -- to make that determination, so we don't know who's in the right here.       So why force the government to -- to go to a termination for convenience?       It's the "go away" principle of our jurisprudence, right? (Laughter.)
09-1343 +++$+++        When you say "its distributor," was this distributor at all controlled by the defendant?       It might be better to refer to it as the company that distributed its product, rather than calling it "its distributor."       It's loaded, it seems to me.       Mr. Fergenson, I suppose you could say the same thing about any United States manufacturer -       -- who would desire to sell his product in any of the States that would buy it.       And to say that this foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in any State, which -       -- none of our cases hold.       Also, I don't think it's worth your time, because frankly it doesn't make a whole lot of difference to me whether they can sue in Ohio or not.     You really think that that's --       What about in the United States?     Would the United States have jurisdiction?       The United States would not?     They surely targeted the United States.       That's right.     But if the national sovereign, the United States, provided by statute that Federal district courts would have jurisdiction over any -- any tort suit by a person injured by a foreign manufacturer that targeted the United States, would that be proper?       Of course.     It's a hypothetical.       Hypotheticals are always speculation.       How do you speculate about that?       Well, Congress has power to control the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and Congress says Federal courts have jurisdiction over this matter.
09-1403 +++$+++        Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you talked about loss causation.     The Respondents assert that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing, that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was nothing that could justify the presumption. Would you be satisfied if we just said that we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the theory that Respondents assert they have already adopted?     I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss causation.       Well, they -- they would construe it the way Respondents say they have already construed it.       I think what you've said is that there's really no difference between loss causation and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit found.       Right.       Okay, but -- but you -- you would want us to say that and not just say that loss causation -       But you acknowledged that if the cause was the fact that the market was not efficient, that could be raised at the certification stage.       Can you -- can you do this in reverse?     I mean, suppose the class comes in and, instead of proving at the outset that the market's an efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they come in at the back end and they say:     When that statement that we assert was a misrepresentation was corrected, the price of stock went down and we lost money. Now, it seems to me you would have to argue, well, that's a good allegation if it's an efficient market, which is a common question, right?       So they can certify under Rule 23 by using the back end.     Instead of proving the efficient market, they can prove that there was a statement correcting the alleged misrepresentation, the price of stock went down, right, and they can certify the class?       Why not?     It would be -- it would be a common question whether the market's efficient or not.       They're not relying on that assumption.     They -- they come in and show that there was a correction of what we alleged was a misstatement and the market went down.     That's all that they allege. And of course, that proves anything only if there's an efficient market.     But that will be a common question to the whole class, so we'll, we'll -- we'll save that for later.       Well, but they assert that. They assert that the reason it went down was because of the initial misstatement.       I understand that.     I'm just saying that seems to me it's a crazy way to run a railroad.       If you can allege what's upfront, you can allege what's -- what's in the back, and what's upfront becomes a common question, so you certify the whole class.
09-1454 +++$+++        Not so fast. (Laughter.)       What I was about to ask is this:     I can agree with you that -- that where there is a -- a determination on the merits, it should be reviewable, but could still disagree that it's reviewable where the requirements for Article III are not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable controversy between the parties. What -- what is the interest of the -- of the parties who were victorious here?       But it takes -       It takes two to tango, and a case or controversy requires somebody on the other side who cares a fig about the outcome.     And here, S.G., who was the -- the young woman affected in the case, has moved to another State and -- making it virtually certain that she'll never confront this situation again. She doesn't care what the result of this thing is. Besides which, I think she's, what, 17 years old or so now?     It's impossible that she will be confronted with the same situation.       How does it affect the Fourteenth Amendment?     There's a Fourteenth Amendment claim pending below?       And what's the substance of that?       That would make you happy, won't it?     Won't that make you happy?       There are different panels on the Ninth Circuit, aren't there?       And -- and they don't all hold the same thing, fortunately, do they? (Laughter.)       But an opinion that is vacated is not circuit precedent, is it?       There was a dissent in that case, wasn't there?       But that wouldn't be the case if the opinion were vacated -       -- under Munsingwear?       Why?     What's the test? Isn't the test clearly established law?       Would this be clearly established law under any -- any conceivable interpretation of that?       Well, so then walking along the hall in the school, right?       Just come up alongside "By the way, I wanted to ask you whether your mother --" (Laughter.)
09-1476 +++$+++        You agree that the Petition Clause is -- is different and does have a separate content?       But the Speech Clause, in the employment context, has been interpreted to cover the content.     Whether it -- whether it applies or not depends upon the content, right?       And you want the Petition Clause also to turn on the content?       But it seems to me you're either petitioning the government or you're not petitioning the government.     Why -- why shouldn't the line be, if you're petitioning the government as employer is different from petitioning the government as ruler?     Why shouldn't that be the line that we draw?       Which wouldn't necessarily break out the same way as whether it's a matter of private concern versus a matter of public concern.       But the core -- the core of the Petition Clause is petitioning.     The core of the Free Speech Clause is political speech, of course - speech in public interest -- but the core of the Petition Clause is quite different.     It's simply whether you're petitioning.     Surely you -- you could petition the -- most of the petitions in the early years were regarding private matters; isn't that right?       That's true, and it seems to me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking for a change.     And it seems to me that the key distinction, if there is one, is whether you're asking for a change in -- by your employer in your employment conditions or a change by the government in some matters over which the government has control as -- as sovereign.       It may well be, may well be.       Would they have to do both? Would they have to do both?       If you're proceeding with a claim under two separate provisions of the Constitution, it should not be surprising that you might have two different tests.       I think all you're saying is that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is the element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I suggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in Pickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what the individual was asking for a change in employment conditions?     That would be one of the questions.     If so, it was a private matter, and then you go on to the rest of the balancing. But it seems to me you have to make that determination under Pickering balancing anyway, and once you make it, you've answered the -- the Petition Clause question.       Of course, you have to wrestle with the same problem if you apply the other test that you -- you were proposing.       Namely, whether it's a private matter or a matter of public concern.     You confront the same difficulty, don't you?       If -- if lawsuits are covered by the Petition Clause, why is it that in the innumerable cases this Court has had concerning what due process of law consists of, we've never mentioned what the Petition Clause requires.     I mean, if the Petition Clause guarantees access to the courts, certainly there are some minimum requirements that it imposes as well, and I don't recall any of our cases dealing with lawsuits that mention the Petition Clause.     That's rather extraordinary if indeed it governs all lawsuits.       Maybe that's all they had in mind, or petitions to the executive as well.     What - what evidence do you have that it applied to lawsuits?       I agree with you that that's slender.       What -- wouldn't a -- a written letter to -- to the employer, the government employer, similarly be a petition?     Is a lawsuit any more of a petition, if indeed it is a petition at all, which I doubt?     Surely filing a statement with the employer is a petition as well.     So how does the form make any difference?
09-1498 +++$+++        It's not part of the rationale.     The rationale for our decision would be (h)(1)(D) alone, and all the other discussion would be perfectly gratuitous, because we're going to set this individual free anyway.     To say, well, this other thing is not a good reason to set them free, but this one is, I mean, that -- the former is just utterly irrelevant to our decision.       I'm not disagreeing with you.     I'm trying to help you.       I'm sure it's not impermissible, but I'm also sure that if we do it, what we say about the ground for which we took the case would be -- would be the purest dictum.       It's their fault; they shouldn't follow dictum, you know?       No.     You want to -       May I suggest that perhaps the reason not to do it is, assuming this person was treated entirely fairly on the basis of the law that existed at the time, the consequence of what Justice Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly convicted of a crime.       And to do that simply because, although the -- the process was perfectly fair when it was applied, there's been a change in the rule and therefore we don't redo it, but we let this person go; right?       And can't be tried again.       I don't -- I don't agree with that.     Do you agree with that?
09-150 +++$+++        Forget about formality, in other words.     Formality or no formality has nothing to do with it.       That is -- that is what it says.       It's the -- it's the - it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the questioner.       What possible response to an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind?     What possible response to an ongoing emergency?       He was bleeding to death, and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death. Now, that statement would -- would be, you know, suggesting an ongoing emergency. But giving the name of the person who shot him, where he was shot, what does that have anything - how does that have anything to do with an ongoing emergency?       But he does.       But he does.       He knows -- he knows that his -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near there.     He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far away was it?     Six blocks or -- a good distance from where the shooter was.     He knows all of that. The only reason he could be giving the name of the person who shot him is so that person could be apprehended and punished.       One way to evaluate those statements is what they are made in response to.     If they are made in response to a certain type of police inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial.     And another kind -- you know, are you dying?     They are more likely not to be testimonial.     But it is ultimately the statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether they are testimonial or not.       Well, if it was an emergency, he wouldn't have asked, what happened?     He would ask, what is happening?       To ask what happened is to ask the declarant to describe past events, which is testimonial.       And if you're worried about that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on the ground or do you examine the gas station first, rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter that you think is still in the gas station? The -- the behavior of the police here gave no indication that they thought they were in danger immediately and were interrogating this person in order to assess the danger to them.     That wasn't what they were after.       So at least whenever the police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not still nearby, and that testimony will always be admissible?       No, no, no.       Strike "designed to assess the risk."     You don't know what they're designed to do. These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk. They just asked the questions.     And that's what is going to happen in future cases. And you're saying, whenever policemen come upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it, what's his name, all of that will always be admissible because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?       Only when he's excited, right?     Only when the victim who has been the object of a violent crime is excited. Or if State law doesn't apply and we're dealing with a Federal crime and Federal officers, right, and trial in Federal court?     And in that case, what Justice Breyer just said would not apply.       Do you distinguish between collecting evidence for a future prosecution and collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the felon?     Do you distinguish those two? And you can say these police -- these policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter was and where he was so they could go get him.     Would that -       Would that not be collecting evidence for a future prosecution?       But you say it has to be for the purpose of a future prosecution.     Just -- just in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who committed this crime, that doesn't qualify?       When does that not exist in the case of a violent crime?     When does that not exist?       There's a violent criminal out there.       Okay.     So if you use a gun, a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets admitted into evidence, because the police could - could be not -       -- not trying to get evidence, but just trying to safeguard society against the -- the felon on the loose?       I thought that's how you just described it.       Yes.       Who did it.       That's always the case. That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of the testimonial rule is.     That's always going to be the case, at least when there's a violent crime.       And you may as well take Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of serious cases, if that's going to be your rule.       The crime was ongoing in - in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with the operator.     It was ongoing.     She was seeking help from the emergency that was occurring to her at that moment.     There's nothing like that here.       Will they ever know that?       I mean, is that -- is that likely not always to be the case when -- when you come upon a person who has been the -- the victim of a violent crime? You could say it all the time.     No, they didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a trial.       I don't understand what you're saying.     You mean he has to intend to provide evidence that he knows will be used at trial?     I don't think that's the test.       He's intending to accuse somebody.
09-152 +++$+++        But you haven't really answered Justice Alito's question as to why the later language is not surplus.     If indeed it bears the technical meaning you say that it -- that it bears, that later language is surplus.       Say that again.     I don't follow it.     Tell me that again.       Right.       Mr. Frederick, I have this problem with -- with your interpretation.     As -- as has been said, the government interprets "unavoidable" to mean unavoidable with respect to the vaccine that has been approved. If it doesn't mean that, if it simply means unavoidable with some other vaccine, you could always avoid them if you have a vaccine that is significantly less effective.     I mean, what other vaccine are you comparing it with?       I understand that, but the plaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have eliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects would not occur.     Of course the vaccine would only be effective in 75% of the cases, but nonetheless, it was avoidable.       Well, that doesn't answer my question.     I acknowledge it rests on current scientific knowledge, but current scientific knowledge would enable you to design a drug that does not have these side effects even though it's significantly less effective, and there is no criterion as to how much less effective it has to be to qualify and so forth, whereas the government's interpretation of the word ties it to a -- to a particular vaccine.       It has to be just as effective?       Just as effective?
09-1533 +++$+++        I don't understand that. I can understand the argument that -- that Congress was - was directing its statute at crack, and crack had -- had a very definite meaning, which didn't include any substance that -- that is rock-hard and has been produced in the manner you suggest. You're coming up -- you're urging upon us a definition that neither is the definition of crack nor is the chemical definition of cocaine base.     It's neither fish nor fowl.       Crack.       That's right.     But you don't argue that.     That's not the meaning you want us to give it.       It's essential to crack.       You wouldn't call it crack if it weren't made that way, would you?       How does "cocaine base" suggest what you want?     It has to be -- it has to be rock and it has to be base cocaine produced in one of the fashions you suggested.     I don't know how "cocaine base" remotely suggests that.       All of them or just crack?       Mr. Pincus, you've lost me. You've responded to the Chief Justice when he raised the problem that this has to be not just cocaine base, it has to be a mixture containing cocaine base, you responded to him by saying:     Well, crack always has some mixture in it; it's never -- it's never pure; and that's why crack would be covered. But in response to Justice Alito, who asked you what if it's pure, if it's pure cocaine base, without any admixtures, you said that would still be covered.     I mean, both answers can't be right.       Yes.       As a practical matter what difference does it make?     Is the government going to be prosecuting anybody for possessing coca leaves?       I don't think Congress knew what this chemical debate was all about.     I -- I think it's very unlikely.       Let's assume that the government's right and -- or that you're right.     And that it's -- no, let's assume the government's right, and it is -- no, you say it's base.       You say it's both, but it includes base.       And let's assume you're right.     So what?       It's the same with homicide and murder.     Every murder, every murder, is a homicide.
09-158 +++$+++              Excuse me.       Before you get beyond that, what you are talking about here is the judgment under which he is being held in custody, right?             And that -- even if you divide it, that judgment hasn't changed.             He is still -- even -- his sentence has been altered and it's sent back for resentencing, but he is still being held in custody under the same judgment.             That's true.       But -               Excuse me.        The reason Lawlor doesn't work is what you have there is different acts.   The later judgment is -- is not just a later judgment with respect to the same act.                    It's a later judgment with -- with respect to a different act.                       Here you are saying you want to apply the same rule with respect to a later judgment, redoing the judgment for the same prior act.      And I don't think that the same rule has to apply.               Not the identical thing. The last one was for the smoke that went last year.                       The next one is for the smoke that went this year.               The same act of his.       I'm talking about the act that is the basis of the lawsuit.               It's the very same act.             Well, wait.      First - before you get off whether this is second or successive, although the -- the State didn't put it this way, I think what the State is clearly saying is that if it is the second petition that could have raised this issue, it is second or successive.           What's wrong with that?             Why doesn't that fit -- fit the statutory language?             It doesn't use -             -- it doesn't use "judgment," either, and -- and -- and you are -- you are dragging in judgment as the -- as the -               Okay.        So if -- if this is the -- if this is the second time that this claim could have been presented, it's a second -- it's a second or successive claim.
09-223 +++$+++              On the other hand, until the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted, which - which eliminated all prudential bars to standing -- it clearly was the law that you could not complain about preference, unlawful preference, being given by the government under regulatory provisions to a competitor. The law was:     That's tough.           There was no standing.          And that was a prudential law, I assume.                      And I don't know why it's any different from the tax law.              Yes, but this -- but this doctrine, I -- I am not very sympathetic to that argument because this is a doctrine that is directed to the State collecting taxes, not to interfering with State regulation.    That -- that's a different doctrine.             All threshold non-merits questions are jurisdictional questions?             What is the case you're citing.             Do you have a volume anywhere?             Okay.             Okay, fine.      It can be answered before jurisdictional questions, but you moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.                And -- and that is not a basis for dismissal here.            The -- the basis is failure to state a claim, I guess, on which a Federal court can grant relief.   But I -- anyway.                That is so -- okay.
09-291 +++$+++        Is Ms. Regalado still engaged to this fellow?       Yes.       Oh, they're married.       Oh, good.     Well, why didn't she bring this suit?       Well -       I don't want to have to go before a jury as an employer all the time.     I want -- I want a safe harbor.     I don't even want to mess with people that might -- that might be buying a lawsuit. And you're telling me, well, you know, I can't help you. You have to go before a jury and say if this person is close enough. Why can't we say members of family and fiancs?     Would -- would that be a nice rule?       I know.       Yes, but as -       As the Chief said, it -- it spreads much further than Burlington Northern. Burlington Northern -- at least you know who it is you have to be careful with -       -- the person who's -- you know, who has made a complaint.     But -- but with what you're proposing -- my goodness, I don't know who it is I have to be careful with.
09-329 +++$+++        Of course, I suppose -       I suppose, having done it twice before, we could in this case apply Auer without explaining why it is that Auer is not inconsistent with Mead, right?     We did it twice before; we could do it here.       Absolutely.       That's a lot more trouble, though. (Laughter.)       Mr. Waxman, you refer to footnote 7 on page 29 of your blue brief?     Is that what you said?       Oh, of the petition.     All right.       Well, you know, we don't - we don't do that with Congress.     When -- when a later Congress says what a statute enacted by an earlier Congress meant, we don't -- we don't retroactively say, well, that must be what it meant.     Are there other examples of where the Board says what a prior rule meant that we deferred on?       So, what would have to be disclosed, just the increase in rate?       Not the reason for the -       Page A?       8.
09-337 +++$+++               Well, you don't -- I didn't understand you to deny that the ticket made it very clear who operated the ship.              Do you contest that?              Well, why not?           Don't you read the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit?              So you are -- you either are contesting or you re not contesting that it's clear from the ticket.    I had assumed it was clear from the ticket.              So you had -- so then you had notice even before the suit was filed.                      It was on the -- it was on the ticket.             Not -- not if you read the definitions on page 1.        And if you are not going to read all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you would at least read page 1.             And that, it seems to me, made it clear.             I thought that the only condition was that it had to arise out of the same event or transaction, which would give you much more running room than -- than what you assert.               Mr. Bendure, can -- can I come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it seems to me you re giving too narrow an interpretation, and I would not like our opinion to read any more narrowly than the statute allows. It seems to me that if you assert a different claim arising out of the same transaction, you would be able to amend.         If you will look at (c)(1)(C), which is what you re asserting here, right?              (C)(1)(C) says,  the amendment changes the party or the naming of party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied.             Then you go back to (1)(B) and it says,  the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out. It doesn't say it has to be the same claim.               I understand that.   That's why I don't understand why you re arguing a more narrow -- a more narrow interpretation.               It seems to me you re home free with (B).             Oh, yes, but -- but those are the only things we -- we have to argue about.             There s no doubt that you are asserting -- even if you were asserting a different claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or event, didn't it?             Okay.              This is sort of an equitable rule, isn't it, this mistake?                      We're going to, you know -- equity takes account of such things.                      It seems to me very reasonable to say:                      If the mistake is egregious, it doesn't apply.
09-338 +++$+++                She might have been sneezing.    I mean, we don't know what caused the pause, do we?              What if, in fact, there isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not declare a mistrial?      Can the judge go ahead and declare a mistrial?              That's not a very big fact.             Was there an objection here by counsel for the defendant?              Mr. MCGormley, is it your burden to answer that question?                 Given AEDPA, is it up to you to show that this case is within the mainstream or is it up to the other side to show rather conclusively that it is not in the mainstream?                      I thought that's what AEDPA required.              It is Petitioner's burden to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no discharge of the jury.         And I'm not aware that they have carried that burden.      But we will ask when they come up. It is their burden, however.             But again, that's --that's not your burden.    We are operating here under a statute which says:    "In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.               The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence." Now, what is the factual determination that has been made here?                   I assume it's the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.              And that has to be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, correct?              Why didn't you answer that to those questions.             Mr. MCGormley, what evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not deadlocked?             Which is presumably what the other side has to prove by clear and convincing evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the State court.
09-350 +++$+++        What was the -- what was the basis for that -- for that exception, that declaratory judgment does not affect the fisc of the -       It does -- it does, though, if you have attorneys' fees.     What -- what was the total attorneys' fee award in this case?       What's far above?     Like what?     I suspect -       I suspect the case is mostly about attorneys' fees.       Well, you could get the individual officer who's denying the marriage license or whatever the offensive act is.     You could sue that person under 1983 and get -- and get injunctive relief, I suppose.
09-367 +++$+++              And the sentence is not final until then?             And -- and what if -- what if the court does set a date for additional sentencing? Then it's not final until then, right?             Well, what -- what do you do about the further provision that at any time later, if the government -- or the victim finds additional basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it, within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the court and ask for restitution?              What does that do? Does that --             I mean, doesn't that necessarily mean that there are indeed two final judgments?   That -- that one has to be -- has to go up on its own, doesn't it?             Where is that?             Oh.     Oh --  a sentence that imposes an order  --             --  is a final judgment, notwithstanding the fact that  --             Got you.             Of course, the same thing would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he escapes any -- any criminal punishment.                       It happens all the time.   The judge makes a mistake; society pays for it.             Now, what -- what can the defendant do within that 90 days?                He has to wait 90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been given; is that right?             That's 3 months that -- that he has to sit on his hands.             Must take it into account --            -- if you read 3553 the way it's written.              I -- I have a question going just to that.   It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said -- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the sentencing court to consider the totality of the sentence it s imposing, including the restitution, that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to impose the incarceration part of the sentence.              No?             Before you do that, tell me what the government appeal would consist of.                       The 90 days has expired --             And you -- you tell me the court -- the court has no ability to impose restitution after 90 days.             What's the use of appealing?             And the appellate court says too bad --             There is no time limit on the mandatory minimum.
09-400 +++$+++        Yes, but -- but you say that those decisions that contribute have to be decisions by supervisory personnel.     If your theory is correct, I don't know why that is so.     I don't know why a co-employee who has a hostile motivation and makes a report to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the individual, why that -- that wouldn't qualify as well.       The -- the employer would be liable for these lower supervisory employees here why?     Did they have authority to discharge?       Why do they stand in different shoes from a co-employee who also contributes to the ultimate decision to fire?       Mr. Schnapper, I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question.     I find it difficult to grasp the distinction that you draw or what it seems that could possibly exist between a willful motivating factor and a non-willful motivating factor. I mean, to say that it's motivating is -- is to say that it's willful, it seems to me.     But you want us to draw a distinction between a willful motivating factor and a non-willful motivating factor.       You -- you want to hold the -- the employer liable for the actions of these other officials, other than the one who did the firing.     And if they are liable for -- if you hold them -- the employer liable for their contribution to the filing, it seems to me you have to hold him liable for their willfulness as well.       Well, I don't think anybody thought that Buck would have fired him just for that one absence.     That -- that was the trigger.     But it was the trigger that followed a long series of prior absences for which he had been disciplined before.       I don't see any inconsistency between those two versions.
09-448 +++$+++              It was the same in Hanrahan.   There was a right to a certain process in the lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved reversal.   It was sent back and said:                  Do it right.   Give this person the process that -- that he s entitled to.             As the Respondent points out, the position you re taking is unusual for the government.    The government is usually arguing against fees, because the fees are often assessed against the government.             -- and you re essentially saying that when there is simply a procedural victory, which happens all the time, when -- when an agency is -- is reversed in its procedure even though the -- the -- the petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief until it goes back to the agency and may lose in the agency ultimately, you re -- you re content to say that fees are assessable in that situation, just by reason of the procedural victory.             No, I'm talking about other prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that don't say "prevailing party."             Sure.                I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision as having anything to do with trust law.                It's -- it's a requirement of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial.
09-475 +++$+++              Hay production out.
09-479 +++$+++        And -- and I suppose the prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it chooses to bring in a single prosecution. I mean, if it has other -- other enhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for that.     So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in one prosecution, you get the break.     But if -- if the other enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a separate prosecution, you don't get it.       Yes.     Yes, I understand what you're saying.       So let's suppose somebody commits a rape and a maiming in the same -- in the same criminal act.     You're saying that the prosecution -- and let's assume it's his third.     It's his third violent crime.     So he would get the enhancement as being, you know, a three-time violent crime loser. You're saying he could get that enhancement and the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he had a gun at the same time.     He can get it if the prosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which he will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then in a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the use of a firearm.     Then he gets both enhancements, right?       That seems -       Well, he's disagreeing with you.     He -- your theory -- you're not reading "crime" to mean an affair in the world.     You're reading it to mean a particular prosecution for a particular violation of a statute.     Right?       He wants to read it as an affair in the world, whatever that means.       And there has never been the incentive to do so, until we accept your interpretation.     Then there will be means to do so.       Excuse me, before you go on.     Your last remark -- it has to be a previous conviction.     So why doesn't that leave it in the hands of the prosecutor whether to bring that conviction, that other case, prior or subsequent?
09-497 +++$+++                 I guess you could argue that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been coerced into signing it.         I guess you could make that argument, can't -- couldn't you?             Has -- has that argument been made here?             Was the argument made that because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have been coerced into making it?             I didn't think it -- it had been made.              I don't agree with that.          I mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now, I'm not sure that that's enough evidence.                   You may need some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court. But if that is the argument, that the one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator.             You don't think that could be used along with other evidence?                   I think all you re saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement.             But you could use it as evidence if there s other evidence supporting that. Couldn't you?             I think you can answer that yes or no.   Can you use that in addition to other evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?                Do you agree that a contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced, that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a finding of coercion?        You don't agree with that, do you?              Can you --              Once again, has this argument been made here?           I thought that the only basis was unconscionability.         I suppose you could have made the argument that the contract is void because one of its essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and, therefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the whole contract fails.        I suppose you could make that argument.    That hasn't been made, has it?              Can they make it here now? Can they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know, even if there was no reason to make it in the district court, is the law --              -- that since they didn't have an opportunity to make it in the district court, they can make it in the Supreme Court?             If there s no access to arbitration, there s no way that you can leave that issue to the arbitrator, is there?             Because you never get to the arbitrator.
09-520 +++$+++        Mr. Phillips, this is what troubles me about -- about your position:     You make a viscerally appealing case on the facts of this case, where you say that your clients, the railroads, are being taxed more than competing carriers, truckers and -- and water carriers. But if all -- if all it says is "discriminates," and you think that that has to be applied without qualification, then even if -- if a state makes an exemption for, you know, widows over 85 and doesn't make the same exemption for railroads, the railroads win, right?       Why?     How do you limit the term "discrimination"?     Just a discrimination in favor of other competing carriers?       Why -- why do you assume that?     Congress didn't limit it to that in -- in the property tax exemption.       But not -- not just the industrial and -- and commercial competitors with the railroads.     The railroads were to be given, you know, the most favored treatment of -- of all the industrial and -- and commercial entities, I -- I think.       So -- so 85-year-old widows would be covered?     That would be discrimination because, you know, there are only resident 85-year-old widows who are covered, right?       I agree with that, and that makes me suspect that Congress didn't -- didn't want to forbid exemptions in (b)(4).       It doesn't make any -- any sense, you are quite right; but -- but Congress thought it made sense in (1) to (3), so why doesn't it make sense in (4)?       That's the argument.       Use a lot of conjunctions. (Laughter.)       Mr. Phillips, do you agree that -- that, generally applicable produces the same - requires the same inquiry as discriminates?
09-5201 +++$+++              But it doesn't always mean that.     I think you say somewhere in your brief that it always means that.      It surely does not always mean that. Because in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now. 3624(d) says that, "Upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau of Prisons shall give him clothes, money and transportation." Now there the expiration of his term of imprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of imprisonment.    It means the assigned term of imprisonment less all the good time credits he has had.              Unless you think they are supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several months after he leaves.              Right.              I'm not addressing that. All I'm -- look, it -- the text says "upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of imprisonment."    My only point is that that -- you have to acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase "term of imprisonment" that does not mean the sentence he was given, but rather means the sentence that he served.               That's right.              How can you earn the good time?   I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you are a good prisoner for a year.               So you are going to let him out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't earned the good time in the year?              What did he do?           How has he?              Exactly.              Of course, the government contends it's none of the sentencing commission's business.    It's up to the Bureau of Prisons.                 Isn't that the government's position?
09-525 +++$+++        Is -- is JCM an agent?     Are you acknowledging that they're an agent of -- of the fund?       What -- what purposes are that?     For purposes of -- at issue here?       Yes.     Okay.       I thought that the question on which we granted cert was very clear:     whether the Fourth Circuit erred in concluding that a service provider can be held primarily liable in a private securities fraud action for, quote, "helping," close quote, or, quote, "participating in," close quote, another company's misstatements. Now, is -- is that an accurate description of the Court's holding?     It was not objected to by the Respondent here.       And that's what I thought we granted.     We weren't talking about control here. That was not the issue, I thought.
09-529 +++$+++        Well, let's assume -- and -- and I'm not sure what the situation is in -- in the Commonwealth.     We have held that the States don't have to have the same notion of separation of powers that the Federal Government does.     In the Federal Government, we allow independent regulatory agencies separate from the President.     Let's assume that Virginia has a system in which the governor is indeed in charge of the entire - the entire executive branch.     Do you know whether that's the case?     I don't know.       Okay.     Well, if it were and if Congress offered money to the State and the only way the State could get it would be to abandon its system of separation of powers and to allow an agency of the State which would normally be under the direction of the governor to go riding off on its own and -- and sue the governor, do you think there wouldn't be any -- any problem about -- about the Federal Government doing that?       Requiring the State to in effect alter its -- its governmental structure in order to obtain the Federal money?       Sure.       Got you.       I guess, in Nixon v. United States, the President could have dismissed the attorney general, but we allowed the suit to go forward.     I never did understand that. (Laughter.)       Yes, I -       That can't be.     How can that be?     He has no power as attorney general to do that.     It has nothing to do with -- with Ex parte Young. It has to do with his power as attorney general.       But your -- your answer -       I really lost you.     I thought Ex parte Young applied to defendants.       I didn't think Ex parte Young allows -- allows an attorney general to sue -- to sue as a plaintiff in his personal capacity.     Am I wrong about that?
09-530 +++$+++        Mr. Katyal, what is the well-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to institutional -- to informational privacy that the Government is -- is willing to acknowledge?     You -- you apparently don't -- don't challenge the existence of such a constitutional right.       It's a strange way to proceed.     We normally don't do that, see?     If there were a constitutional right, would it cover this?       Do we do that in cases?     I don't think so.       That would justify not defining it broadly or narrowly.     It wouldn't justify not reaching the question of whether there is any such constitutional right at all.       We do have a legislature, don't we, that can place some limits on what the Government asks employees or anybody else?       It's the same legislature that prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of information, isn't it?       And it's possible that that's the protection that the Framers envisioned, rather than having courts ride herd on -- on Government inquiries.
09-5327 +++$+++            Well, that -- but that's the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should have been done.           He has assured the client, I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it.           That's all that happened here.          We've never held that equitable tolling for anything is available under this statute of limitations here.           And why should it be?        It seems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of limitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five years, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions to the five years.   But here you have a statute that -- that provides exceptions, for example,  the limitation period shall run from the latest of the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation  & is removed.  In other words, we re going to toll it for that particular event. The date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court  -- we re going to toll it for that. The date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through exercise of due diligence. Many of -- many of the equitable tolling holdings involved precisely that.             We ll toll it since you couldn't have found out about the violation within the statutory period. But all of these things are handled already in 2244(d).     Why should we -- why should we assume the right to create some additional exceptions from the -- from the 1-year period?          We have a case this afternoon involving an opinion of ours named MCNally, which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action for a right to honest services.           How many of the courts of appeals had held that there did exist such a right when we held that there didn't in MCNally?          Every single court of appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a right.   So the mere fact that you have 11 court of appeals that have found that they have extraordinary power -- judges like to find that they have power -- and that doesn't necessarily make it right.          All of that has nothing to do with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability to -- to bring the habeas action.          All of that is -- is preliminary to that.     This may have been a very irresponsible lawyer, but that has nothing to do with the event that -- the simple event, failure to file in that what, 30-day period, which --          Fourteen days.     It seems to me "extraordinary" means unusual.           So you say any unusual event is a possible?          Any unusual event is a possible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year, but this is unusual so we will give you a year and a half.          And had a lot of time to devote to it.
09-559 +++$+++                What -- what about requiring disclosure of campaign contributions?               Do you think that is unconstitutional?               Right.           Now, why doesn't that fall within your principle that no person should be exposed to criticism for --             -- his political beliefs?             Mr. Bopp, do you have any case in which we have held that the First Amendment applies to activity that consists of the process of legislation, of legislating --             -- or of adopting legislation? What is that?             That is --             Soliciting signatures is not taking part in the process of legislating.              The person who requests a referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in that. And in light of the fact that for the first century of our existence, even voting was public -- you either did it raising your hand or by voice, or later, you had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so that people knew which party you were voting for -- the fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount of civic courage.    And the First Amendment does not protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls when you exercise your political rights to legislate or to take part in the legislative process.              You are asking us to enter into a whole new field where we ve never gone before.             Not even just your name, so they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person?             Of course, they can.   So they can get your name, right?             Okay.             But you re objecting to the public being able to check whether the agency is indeed finding out whether this is a genuine petition or not, correct?             Really?             Didn't you have some options, too?    Have you started a referendum to repeal the -- the California law that requires disclosure?             I don't understand.    I thought that s what you re challenging.                 The --          I'm sorry.            I'm sorry.          Washington.           I got the wrong State.          The people of Washington -- the people Washington evidently think that this is not too much of an imposition upon people's courage, to -- to stand up and sign something and be willing to stand behind it.          Now, if you don't like that, I can see doing it another way.              But -- but the people of Washington have chosen to do it this -- this way.          And you re saying that the First Amendment absolutely forbids that.          That's fine.           Proving my point.             It might have been a good idea.              What about just -- just -- what about just wanting to know their names so you can criticize them? (Laughter.)             Is -- is that such a bad thing in a democracy?             But part of the reason is so you can be out there and be responsible for the positions you ve taken.             So that people -- people can criticize you for the position you have taken.             What do you mean, "both sides"?   The other side hasn't signed anything.            When they sign something -- (Laughter.)             When they sign something, they ll be out there for public criticism as well.             You know, you can't run a democracy this way, with everybody being afraid of having his political positions known.             Well, that's bad.       The threats should be moved against vigorously --             -- but just because there can be criminal activity doesn't mean that you -- you have to eliminate a procedure that is otherwise perfectly reasonable.
09-571 +++$+++        These are people who haven't gone to law school, right?       And do not know that you cannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?       If you were giving guns to lawyers, it might have been different. (Laughter.)       Depending on the law school they went to or what? {Laughter.)       I thought he asked that. So I was glad to see that.     Thank you.       Not -- not before this case.     There was some --       -- later, as far as we know.
09-5801 +++$+++        What separates a stereotype from a reality?     Do you say it is not true that if there is a legitimate -- illegitimate child, it is much more likely that the woman will end up caring for it than that the father would?       That's not true?       Mr. Hubacheck, you are asking, I think, that the Court pronounce your client to be a United States citizen.     Isn't that the only pronouncement from -- form the Court that is going to do your client any good?       Unless he's a United States citizen.       A reversal of the judgment on the grounds that your client is a United States citizen, right?       That he is, not that - that he is.     That he is.     Do you have any other case where a Court has conferred citizenship on someone who, under the statutes as written, does not have it?       Never done.       Unless -- unless we -- we solve the violation the other way, by saying that the father gets the shorter period that the -- than the mother has.       I'm sorry, that the mother gets the longer period than the father has.       You say we can't apply that retroactively.     Well, okay; we don't apply it retroactively.     The people that have citizenship cannot constitutionally be deprived of it, but for everybody else, it's okay.
09-587 +++$+++        Now, that can't be a Ninth Circuit rule.     I mean, that has to depend upon each - each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no? I mean, some State could -- could have a different rule, I assume.     You're -- you're telling us, however, that California has that rule?       Do -- does the court sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?       So you're saying that if it's on both grounds, if they agree with both the procedural and the merits ground, they may well just - just deny without any explanation?     But if they deny only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will say it?       All right.       I thought you just told me that if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural ground and the merits ground, they could issue just - just a denial without explanation.       Now you're telling me that -- the opposite.       That will always be in the order.       Why -- do you think it makes a difference whether the expert would have - would have helped or not?     I mean, counsel has to make that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not ex post.     I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a 1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony would have been very successful. Don't we have to examine it ex ante before he knows what the result will be?       Well, Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical would include the situation where he doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce any expert testimony.     He knows that there is blood there.     He should -- he should get his own expert, whether or not the prosecution uses one.     Right? I mean, can it never be ineffective assistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the prosecution doesn't have one on the other side?       Well, could?     Really?     Is that your test?     It could -- there's some remote possibility?       Excuse me.     You've lost me. I thought you said -- I thought you said that they raised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for cert?       Until the merits brief in opposition?
09-60 +++$+++           I -- I -- I'm not sure I understand what you re saying.           You re saying that his reentry was not illegal because his removal was illegal? Is that what you are saying?          I see.           But it doesn't have to be a State felony?           The felony has to be a Federal felony, right?           Punishable as a felony under the Federal Act.           But this was punishable as a felony because it was his second drug offense.           He was a recidivist.   And although it was only a misdemeanor under State law, under the Controlled Substances Act he could be prosecuted for a felony, for a Federal felony. I -- I -- I don't know why that doesn't fit the statute.           He can't be convicted of a Federal felony in a State court.           He has to be convicted of a crime --            -- which may be a misdemeanor, which would subject him to a felony conviction in Federal court under the Controlled Substances Act.             And I think that's - that's what this is.             He's convicted of a drug offense, and if - if he were prosecuted in Federal court, he would -- he was punishable as a felon --            -- in Federal court under the -- under the Controlled Substances Act.          Let's assume we re not talking about immigration consequences.             Let's -- let's assume we re talking about an American citizen who has committed a -- a misdemeanor drug offense.             When he is brought up under the Controlled Substances Act, even though he wasn't found to have been a recidivist by the State conviction, couldn't he be prosecuted under the Controlled Substances Act for a felony because in fact he is a recidivist?          Yes.          No, but -- the crucial word here is "punishable" as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act.    And the fact is if indeed he s a recidivist, he could be punished for the -- for the felony.    Now, you re quite correct that the Federal court would have to find the recidivism, but -- but still he would be punishable as a recidivist.            And we've held that s okay --            -- that you don t need a jury.        How do you --        How do you distinguish Nijhawan?   I mean, there what made it a Federal felony was the fact that more than $10,000 was obtained from the victims.    But that was not found in the -- in the State conviction.    It simply was not.          That's right.          Right.          No issue.          Well, what about the $10,000? That --          He was never convicted of having obtained by fraud more than $10,000 from the victim.        You still had the word "convicted."        Which is what you re relying on.    That word was applicable there as much as it s applicable here, and we did not require him to have been convicted of having obtained more than $10,000.
09-6338 +++$+++           It wouldn't say that.           It just wouldn't do it.     That's all.          But it s certainly a factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I would certainly take that factor into account.                    Every time I make it retroactive, it s going to reopen -- going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply before.     How can I close my eyes to that if --          -- if I m making the retroactivity determination?           Well, why do you -- why do you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over?               I mean, if you say that there carries over from the prior sentencing his failure to raise the equal protection claim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that the Booker objection doesn't stand?                It's law of the case. It was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the case as far as that's concerned.          I have a better answer to Justice Breyer's question.          You want my better answer?          It's -- it's -- it's not -- it's not section 3582 that s unconstitutional, and it isn't even the provision for being guided by a policy statement of the Sentencing Commission that's unconstitutional.   It is the nature of the Sentencing Commission's policy statement that is unconstitutional. Surely, if the Sentencing Commission had a policy statement which said you will reduce it for white prisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely be unconstitutional, right?          And your point here is that the policy statement which says you effectively will disregard Booker is unconstitutional?          That works, doesn't it?          What -- what if the President reduces the sentence using his pardon power?   He cuts it back; he cuts it in half.               The Bureau of Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the imprisonment?    No, that can't be true.          So why is this any different?          Why is this any different? I mean, there are obviously -- what it proves is that there are exceptions to that requirement that they hold him for the term of imprisonment.              They -- they have to hold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been shortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part of the term by the President or what the argument for the government is, or by application of this retroactive rule by -- by the Commission.
09-658 +++$+++ 
09-6822 +++$+++        Even with the original judge?       Unless there are new facts or some -- some new -       Well -       Yes, but one -- one of the new facts that -- that is before a judge on remand is that part of the basis for his decision has been eliminated.     He -- he gave additional time because of a certain factor, and the court of appeals says:     Oh, no, you can't look at that factor.     And then he looks at the whole thing.     He says:     Gee, without that factor this guy is getting off scot-free. You mean he cannot -- he cannot readjust his other discretionary judgments in light of the fact that this additional factor doesn't exist?     That seems rather -- I don't -- counterintuitive, I guess.       What about 3742(g)(2)?       That's what we're arguing about.       And what's your -       It is.       Was that your fourth point? I'm all on pins and needles waiting for your fourth point.
09-737 +++$+++        But that's not the point that you've made here.     I mean -- and that isn't the point on which we granted certiorari.       No, it doesn't.     It doesn't have to know what it was.     It assumes it to be what - what the plaintiff claims it was.       At the summary judgments, you give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff.       So there's always a factual element to the -- to the ruling.       It's never going to be any better than what you assumed.     It's never going to be any better for the plaintiff than what you assumed at the summary judgment stage. this case.       For -- for -       Why was that?       You've assumed -- you've assumed all the evidence in their favor at the summary judgment stage.       So you really think that this is a realistic scenario where there's going to be even more evidence against them than -- I mean, you're assuming the evidence against them.     There's going to be even more evidence against them than they assumed at the summary judgment?     That's not going to happen very often.
09-751 +++$+++        Are we just talking about a funeral?     That's one of the problems I have with the case.     There was also this video that -- that your client watched, right, later, after the funeral?       Right.     Well, what does that have to do with the funeral?       That's fine, but it -- it does not intrude upon a funeral.     I mean, no.     You -- you either have two separate causes of action -- one is the intrusion upon the funeral, and the other is the harm caused by viewing this -- this posting on the Internet.     But I don't see how they both relate to intrusion upon the funeral.       And they were just submitted to the jury as one big lump, right?       Suppose there hadn't been a funeral protest, just the epic.     Would that have supported the cause of action you -- you assert here?       Yes or no?       Even though it's -- he doesn't have to watch them?     They're just posted on the Internet.       It's his choice to watch them, but if he chooses to watch them he has a cause of action because it causes him distress.       Well, if that statute applies to any protest at funerals, protesting the Vietnam War, protesting whatever, your case involves, at least if we accept your version of it, a protest of the -- of a dead soldier who -- who is going to Hell and whose parents have raised him to go to Hell.     So simply to say you can have a protest within a certain distance is not to say you can have a protest within a certain distance that -- that defames the corpse.     That's -- that's a different issue, isn't it?       So the intrusion upon the privacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right, because that sign would intrude upon the privacy of the funeral just as much?     That's not really what you're complaining about.     You're complaining about the personal attacks, aren't you?       I thought that they had to turn in a different entrance?     Is that -- is that the extent of the disruption?       In order to avoid the protest?       But you wouldn't have objected to that if there weren't these nasty signs, you just said, right?       All right.       Mr. Summers, I'm a little concerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the proposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says, you're contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that that alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the tort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress. What -- what are the requirements for that? I thought that it had to be outrageous conduct.     Doesn't it have to be outrageous conduct?       Well, I mean -- I mean, why accept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you're claiming here?       Mr. Summers, can I -- can I ask this?     Suppose -- suppose I don't think you have a cause of action for invasion of privacy when these people were at this distance from the funeral.     But that was one of the causes of action submitted to the jury. If I disagree with you on that cause of action, I suppose I'd have to say there has to be a retrial now.       So you have to support both causes of action here, the intentional infliction of emotional distress and the invasion of privacy, right?       Waived -- waived what issue?       Oh, all right.     Okay.       I guess that that kind of a call is always necessary under -- under the tort that you're -- that you're relying upon.     The conduct has to be outrageous, right?       That always requires that kind of a call, unless the tort is unconstitutional, as applied to all -- all harm inflicted by words.
09-804 +++$+++        Am -- are we missing something?     They -- they cannot be in the SPD unless they are in the plan; isn't that right?       So -- so the one cannot be more detailed than the other, can it?       Right.     But what -       Whatever is in the SPD must be in the plan; isn't that right?       Yes.     That's what I'm talking about, of course.       It can't be part of the plan without modifying the plan, can it?       Because it contradicts other provisions.       Likely harm to whom?     I think that's the question -       -- that Justice Kennedy is asking, and I have the same question.     Does it mean likely -- is it likely that the class as a whole has been harmed, or that each -- is it likely that each individual member of the class has been harmed?       Or a majority?     Or whatever?       What does "likely harm" mean?     Do we know that?       Why didn't that (h) apply here?     Was it not egregious enough?     Is that -- is that why it didn't apply?     Or they just forgot about it or what?       Why doesn't it apply to the SPD?     Isn't that a notice?       I thought it says -
09-834 +++$+++        Well -       That's -- that's the problem.     I mean, you can talk about a grievance procedure.     I suppose there's always one in -- in companies that -- that are unionized, but an awful lot of companies aren't. Your -- the -- the Respondent is -- is going to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to the filing of a complaint with the government.     And that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and normally I would not be disposed to consider it. My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the question of whether filing means filing only in writing or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that other question.     That is to say, if indeed the complaint has to be quote, "filed" with the government, I'm inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to procedures established by the agency which permit an oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would be okay. But my goodness, if it applies to private employers as well including employers that have no grievance procedures, including employers who have employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an oral complaint in -- in that context.       So you are filing your argument right now.     Now come on, people don't talk like that.       That -- that -- that is absurd.     You are not filing an argument right now. Nobody uses the language that way.       I'm not sure that's true. You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding.     I mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else. But you can file a complaint orally without -- without doing that, it seems to me.       Not if it's never instituted.     Not if it's never instituted.     If no proceeding is ever instituted, you can hardly be accused of having caused a proceeding to be instituted.       So if you make an informal complaint and it doesn't go any further, and they ask - "You know, do you want to" -- "No, I don't want to start a proceeding, but -- but this company is just, you know, it's acting improperly, you guys ought to look into that." That's -- I'm 00 I'm prepared to say that's filing a complaint, if you are only talking about filing complaint with the government.     But if you are talking about oral filings of the complaints with employer, I am very troubled.       This is one of the oldest, though, isn't it.       Is it the very oldest?     It may well be the very oldest.     You are talking about a really old fogey Congress that -- that passed this thing.       What -- what is the language in those statutes?     All those statutes use the language "file a complaint"?       Excuse me.     I don't understand how those agencies have any part in the administration of private lawsuits under this statute.       It administers lawsuits?       I mean, it seems to me it's a matter for the courts.     An agency interprets the statutes that direct the agency's own actions if it has to enforce things and so forth.     But where there is a provision for a suit in court, it seems to me it's up to the courts to decide what it means.       What do you mean by the very same language?     Just -       And the remainder of it? Institute a proceeding -       Be a member of a committee? He is relying on large part on the context of filing a complaint.     Does this statute have those other provisions?       That's a big difference.
09-837 +++$+++        We don't know whether that's a step forward or backward.
09-846 +++$+++        But I also thought that the Court of Claims could give -       Could be brought -       They can give injunctive relief where that's necessary.       You have to extend a case that I didn't agree with when it came out.     You have to extend Bowen in order to achieve that.     Does the government want to extend Bowen?       You could complete it to a denial of recovery?       I don't think that's any comfort to the Indian tribe, do you?       They don't even know who has hunting leases and -
09-868 +++$+++        I don't -- I don't understand your argument at all.     It seems to me the phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review" means postconviction collateral review or preconviction collateral review.     Isn't that what is added? "Post-conviction or other"; what's "other" from "post-conviction"?     I guess it would be preconviction, wouldn't it?       That's fine.     And is this direct review?       So it's collateral review? So -       So you lose.       I would think that if -- if there's anything to the point you're making, it -- it hinges not on the "post-conviction or other collateral" phrase, but rather on the word "review." I suppose it could be argued that you're not reviewing the judgment if you're asking for mercy. Whether a judgment was good or bad, you're -- you're asking for mercy.     And I would -- you know, perhaps it's not review.     Is that your point?       Well, that's only because all the cases we've had involved that.     We've never had a case like this before.     So in all those other cases, we've used the natural term "collateral review."     That doesn't mean it couldn't apply to this.     It just means we've never had occasion to inquire whether it applies to this.       Well, then -- then think you're saying that it only gets reversed for abuse of discretion, right?       And that's a legal ground, it seems to me.     And I don't know how you could say that that's a plea for leniency.     It's a plea that -- that the sentencing court abused its discretion and should have given a lesser sentence.     How is that leniency? It's abuse of discretion.       I don't want to have to figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion review or a leniency review or this or that.     And that -- that makes me inclined to say we should treat your Rule 35 as coming within the tolling provision, so we don't have to grapple with -- I mean, I'm not having very much success understanding the distinction that you're telling me.     I don't want to have to do this for States.       Either -- either your victory will give you absolutely nothing, or you have truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island.     I mean, why would anybody not caption the 35 motion that way?       What's to lose?     You say it doesn't matter if your claim of an illegal sentence is frivolous or not.     What's to lose?       But you've said that this could be done before finality.     I thought -- I -       I'm sure you said that earlier, that this motion can be made before the judgment is final.     Didn't you say that?       But that's not what you just said.       What you just said is after the finality.     Which is it?       Except that it says -       I guess we need a new adjective then, because I'd always thought that there are two kinds of review, direct and collateral.     You say there's a -- a tertium quid.     What do you want us to call that?       I think that maybe it doesn't need to be called anything because it doesn't exist.     I -- I can't -       -- imagine anything that isn't either direct or collateral.
09-893 +++$+++        What if -- what if a State finds it unconscionable to have an arbitration clause in an adhesion contract which requires the arbitration to be held at a great distance from -- from where the other party is and requires that party to pay the cost of the arbitration?     Can a State not find that to be unconscionable?       Well, that wouldn't apply to other -- to other contracts.       Are we going to sit in judgment?     Are we going to sit in judgment?     I know you say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a State wants to apply a lesser standard of unconscionability, can we strike that down?       So how do you address Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no difference between those two things, then how can a State find those terms unconscionable?     Under what theory, general theory of law, would they be -       That is bad, absolutely, but that's not what the State is going to do.     The State is simply going to say:     We find this to be unconscionable.     And you say it's not unconscionable; it's very fair.     And the State says:     Eh, we think it is unconscionable. Are we going to tell the State of California what it has to consider unconscionable?       Yes, but some -- some elements of unconscionability can only arise in a litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a distant location.     How could that possibly apply in - to any other contracts?       Yes.       Three?     What are the three?       I was going to ask you about that.     Right.       So how do you have special rules applicable to banks?       Contracts by banks, can't a State say, you know, certain bank contracts have to have this or that?       They claim that here.     They claim it's the general principle of unconscionability.
09-9000 +++$+++        I don't -- I don't understand the argument you're making.     Are you challenging the constitutionality of the Texas statute?       Well, "as construed" -- I mean, it's their statute.     I mean, you say somewhere in your brief that -- that they gave it an arbitrary and capricious interpretation.     It's up to them how they want to interpret it.     We don't -- we don't reinterpret State statutes because the State Supreme Court interpreted it strangely. It seems to me you're either challenging the statute or -- or you don't belong here.       Okay.     Just so long as we're clear about that.       Well, couldn't the habeas court say the conviction was invalid because of the failure to turn over this -- this DNA evidence, which was relevant to the defense and which was unconstitutionally denied?     Why wouldn't that be a basis for setting aside the conviction?       I'll tell you what the problem is.     The problem is Rooker-Feldman.     That's - that's why all of these things don't make much sense.     I mean, it wouldn't happen because you had the opportunity to raise that in the State court, and now you're retrying what the -- what the State court did decide.       But -- but that would be an obstacle to habeas.       Because in habeas you'd be seeking to set aside -       -- the State court judgment.     Okay?       That's why it's so unrealistic to analyze it that way, it seems to me.       It chose to construe it the way it construed it.     You -- you can't attack the way - the way the State Supreme Court construed its statute.       You're attacking the statute.
09-907 +++$+++        Mr. Burke, isn't it - isn't it the case that, even on the other side's interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual costs anyway?     Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the entire deduction?       Even one payment of $1, you get the entire deduction.     So to argue this case as though it's a question of whether you actually expend the money that you're getting the credit for is simply -- is simply false.     You don't do that under either side's interpretation, right?       I'm trying to help you, Mr. Burke. (Laughter.)       Excuse me.     What -- what happens under the tax law?     Do they make an adjustment under the tax law as well?       A standard -       Right.     So that they - what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee takes you out of the chart.     Is that what you think is the law?       What's the language we're dealing with, Mr. Burke?     Do you want to quote the language to us? Nobody's quoted the language.     What does it say is applicable?       Wait.     The -- the applicable amounts specified where?       Read the text of the statute, would you, please, for me?     I couldn't even get it from your brief.     You had to refer me back to the petition.     Why isn't in an appendix to your brief or printed in the beginning of your brief, instead of kicking me back to dig out your petition?       "Amount specified under" the standard.       "Applicable amounts specified," not the amounts specified if applicable.       I don't understand what you're saying.     He asked, are they split 50-50 on the point that is before us here?     Yes or no?       Of course, once again, Mr. Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this out.     This is not the difference between your position and the position of the other side.     You get the deduction for the other side as well, whether or not you are making the payment.     Now, maybe it can be adjusted by the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned, so long as you make one payment of $1, under their theory you're entitled to claim the deduction; isn't that right?       So.       Is that -- is that by reason of the Internal Revenue Service -       -- manual, or is it by reason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?       So it's in the chart -       -- that you claim -- okay.       Is this a problem distinctive to your case?     Doesn't the other side have the same problem with ownership?     Don't they acknowledge that even if you are leasing the car you get the deduction?       I don't see why this is distinctive to your case.     It's a problem both sides face.     And we don't avoid it by coming out against you, do we?       It would have to go to 1,500 a month, or he, out of the goodness of his heart, would decide to pay that amount?       Right.       Fine.     So why -- why would we assume that he -- I don't know -- your client is an extraordinarily generous fellow.     I don't think most people, when they go through bankruptcy, are going to cough up any more than they have to.
09-958 +++$+++        Excuse me.     You spoke of that, Justice Ginsburg's question, as though it was a hypothetical.     But that could happen, couldn't it?     What if one of these Respondents charged more than the State law permits?     Wouldn't -- wouldn't the State move against them?       So, all they have to do, as far as the Government is concerned, is amend their complaint to say:     We intend to charge higher rates than the State law allows.       And then you -- you'd agree that the suit would lie.       Well, gee, we're not deciding a whole lot here, then.     Just -- it's just a matter of pleading that we're deciding, right?       You -- you do not even exclude all Spending Clause cases.     You only exclude those Spending Clause cases where -- where the plaintiff does not say we are -- you know, we're going to violate the State law, and they're going to come after us.     So, you haven't made an exception for the Spending Clause.
09-987 +++$+++        You haven't -- I don't think you answered his question.     The question was, is there anything in the record that shows whether any of the money that's involved here comes not from parents, but rather from others who can contribute to the program?       Well, I suppose if some of the contributions are considerable, like a million dollars, that couldn't be just a parent, right?       Are there contributions of that size?       And those standards have nothing to do with this program.     They are standards that any private school, religious or otherwise, must meet in order to satisfy the education requirements of Arizona?       I assume that there's a tax deduction for contributions to churches.       And many churches discriminate on the basis of religion, don't they?       Does that pose a constitutional problem, do you think?
09-993 +++$+++        Would the -- excuse me, Justice. Would the Federally licensed drug manufacturer have a similar obligation to lobby the FDA for a change?       But assume there hadn't been.     Assume there hadn't been such a regulation.     Do you understand it to be the government's position that the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to change those warnings?       I thought you said you had to tell the FDA about it.       Okay.     I didn't understand that.       So you say that if the claim here is simply that you did not disclose properly, that claim could be brought?       To disclose to the FDA.       But you just described Buckman as -- as involving precisely that, failure to tell the FDA the purpose of the screws.     You said that the State -- the State suit would lie because of that failure.       Mr. Lefkowitz, do you agree with Justice Ginsburg's characterization of the government's position?     I thought the government was saying that there was an obligation on the part of the generics to propose changes.       Otherwise, the government would be saying you have an obligation to lobby, and I don't think they're saying that.
09-996 +++$+++        Is there some Federal rule that says you have to apply a procedural ground before you decide the merits?       So it's up to California which of the two it wants to use.       Yes, and what -- isn't that a separate rule?     I mean, no matter how soon, if he does it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you can't come back with another habeas with material that you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?       So time -- time has nothing to do with that.     It's just a separate -- a separate bar.       You think 5 years is too long, though?       Yes.       Wait.     No.     Why do you concede that it would be bad?     Can't the State, if it wishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but because the case is so meritorious or for any other reason?     The issue is whether those people who filed 5 years later and knew that it was very late, whether they're entitled to have their cases heard, not whether the -- the State allows somebody who filed 6 years earlier to have it heard.     How does that do any injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you know, you're likely to be denied?       I don't see why the State has to be consistent in it.     If -- as a matter of grace, it can -- it can allow some people, so long as the people who are denied had every reason to believe that they were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in too late.       But -- but the cases that you're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in which the effect of the State decision was to exclude the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision. The matter could not come before the Federal courts.       This is something quite different.     This is applying a time limit.     I don't see why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into the -- whether it's not discretionary.     I mean, to say it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar cases may be treated differently.       So I don't know why you - you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that's used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally different situation.       But none of this is -- is a device as is used in the cases that -- that you are referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude the Federal courts from the case.     That's -- that's not what's going on here, is it?       But that's not a question of adequacy, is it?     It's a question of notice.
10-10 +++$+++        It's -- it's a formal adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in the sense that caused us to require counsel to be provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant does not have.     Many of these proceedings do not involve counsel on the other side, do they?       I'm talking of counsel.     Is it not true that many, perhaps most, of these proceedings do not have counsel on the other side?     It is the wife who is trying to get payment of -- of the - of the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel -       So, why don't you argue for a rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for the defendant in these cases where it has provided counsel or there is paid counsel on the other side? Wouldn't that be fair?       Mr. Waxman, for those of us who think the Due Process Clause doesn't contain whatever we think it ought to contain, but -- but contains what the people who ratified it thought it contained, what's the earliest case that you have which adopts the proposition that you're now espousing, that whenever a civil contempt citation is imposed upon an indigent person, that person is entitled to counsel as a matter of due process?       Do you think -       Whenever there is an erroneous judgment in a civil contempt case, it becomes a criminal contempt case; is that -- is that what you're saying?       My goodness, if -- if you're relying for that proposition only on the fact that we've already said it, why don't you also say we've never said what you want us to say now?     I mean, if that's the only argument, we've already said it.     If it was wrong, we should unsay it.       But if all of the arguments you're making to us are correct, why shouldn't the other accompaniments of a full-dress criminal trial apply -       -- so he has counsel, but the burden's been put on him, rather than on the State, to prove, in fact, that he -- whether or not he is indigent?       It's an illogical distinction, is what I'm saying.       Why -- why isn't the requirement that the judge satisfy himself that there's a willful failure to comply with the order?     Why doesn't that amount to saying the judge has to satisfy himself that this individual cannot pay, or can pay?       It's not willful if he can pay.       If -- if he can't pay.       You know what I mean.       I see.
10-1001 +++$+++        What if the State doesn't, but the Federal government does?     I mean, what if you say, you know, there's no State habeas available; you go straight to Federal habeas?       So you haven't really given us a solution for the States.     They can't -- they can't stop this thing.     Right?       But what --       What about other claims that --     that don't follow on?     I mean, other -- other claimed errors in the trial.     You say the State doesn't have to pay for that representation.     Does counsel keep time sheets on --       -- on the various issues, 12-minute intervals?       And the State pays for some issues and not for other issues?       Well, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel certainly can't be dealt with on direct appeal, right?       So, even if you get a different counsel to -- to take the appeal --       -- you could always claim that that counsel was ineffective in habeas, right?
10-1016 +++$+++ 
10-1018 +++$+++        So -- so, independent counsel would not be covered.     I mean, if you have, you know, a counsel appointed because -- to show that the administration is disinterested in this prosecution and you get independent counsel, the Attorney General says: I will not interfere with him.     The President says:     I will not interfere with him.     Then him you can -- you can sue without any immunity, right?       Why?     He's not working in close coordination.     He's not subject to supervision. The whole purpose of an independent counsel is to eliminate supervision.       Excuse me.     Weren't the prison guards who were -- who were suable in Richardson -- weren't they suable under 1983 as acting under color of law?       Well, the whole issue would have been a nonissue if they -- if they couldn't be sued.       Yes.       Don't you think the -- the two should go pari passu, as we say, that if you can be sued for acting under color of law, you ought to have the defenses that people who are acting with legal authority have?       You seem --       I mean, why does market force eliminate this defense for somebody who's an employee of a private company but not for somebody who's an employee of the government?
10-1024 +++$+++ 
10-1042 +++$+++        Reaching all?     I didn't understand you.     You said it too fast.     As reaching all -- something fees, whether permitted --       Unearned fees whether provided or not.       Well, I suppose if -- if the lower court could have been wrong for either one of two reasons, we don't have to decide which of the two we -- we're precluded from considering, right?       I mean, its -- it would be just as well to say that the question presented here decides the case as it would be to say that the question raised by Justice Breyer decides the case, right?       And is there any reason to put the one before the other?       It could mean that, but it need not mean that.     It could mean either that or just -- just part and not whole; and which of the two it means is often decided by the other words with which it's associated.     I mean, if you have a phrase that says, you know, "tacks, nails, and" -- what?     "Tacks, nails, and wooden pegs," it's clear that "nails" doesn't mean toenails; it -- it means a fastener. And so, also here, when it says "portion, split, or percentage," it seems to me the natural reading is that portion or percentage means not, as it could mean, the whole, but rather just a portion.       That's not what we have. We have -- we have a statute that says you shall not take any portion or split.       Okay?       Give me an example of where the language "give" would have an effect.       Have you deprived it of all effect?       But nothing as big as this, if you accept HUD's interpretation of this, which is essentially the issuance of a -- of a price schedule by HUD, and anything above these prices is an overcharge and hence falls under -- under this provision.     That's immense.       No, but if we don't, then we reject deference to HUD, which you want us to -- to apply.       We can't at one time -- at one and the same time, give deference to HUD and yet disagree with what HUD says.       Well, but I assume that HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt so that if there's any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard rule.     If there's a genuine ambiguity, you -- you find for the interpretation that favors the defendant.     And this here -- I think this is at the very least ambiguous.     And you are telling me -- well, I guess you're right.     I guess HUD is favoring what would be the defendant in this case.       Wait a minute.     If -- you know, if -- if I charge you an exorbitant amount for cutting down a tree, you know, 2,000, $20,000, and then I present my bill, you would say that I have not earned it simply because it's exorbitant?     I don't think you have to evaluate --     Under the Respondent's interpretation, I don't think have you to evaluate the reasonableness of the fee in order to decide whether it was earned or not.       I don't know anybody who -- any knowledgeable person who applies for a loan, who doesn't ask whether there are any points?     I mean, it's standard mortgage practice.     And somebody who says I'm going to get 8 percent?     Yes.     Eight percent with or without points? I mean, that -- I don't think that the mere fact that the interest rate was 8 percent means that you can't charge points and that any charging of points is -- is a charge for a service not performed.     The service performed is giving you an 8 percent rate.       Now, if she didn't want the points, she should have -- when it came to the closing, say what are these points for?     The 8 percent is what you agreed to.     And they would have said, well, that 8 percent is the -- is the rate we give when we charge 2 points.
10-1062 +++$+++        Of course, there would have been a daily fine with or without the compliance order, wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of the -- the Act?       It seems to me there -- there's another distinction, a more significant one, between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or restaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more substantial liability than -- than you would have been subjected to had they not issued the order. It isn't the order that -- that produces any -- any new fine, is it?       What -- what do you care? I mean, you have the fines, don't you?     So, why don't you just argue that?     Why do we have to wrestle with the more difficult situation where there are no fines?     It's conceded that there are fines, isn't it?       So, you know, sufficient unto the day the evil thereof.     We don't have to consider more difficult cases. But, as I understand it, you can get review by applying for an after-the-fact permit from the Corps, and the only -- the only expense you would incur in order to get that would be to fill in, as the order requires you to do, which is something like, what, $27,500 or so?       Is that such a hard -- a hard hit?     That's a lot less than, you know, 37.5 a day.       Well, but their challenge to the compliance order is simply that they don't have wetlands.     It's the jurisdiction of the EPA.     And surely that can be raised in the -- before the Corps of Engineers, no?       How long does it take to get one of those after-the-fact permits?       Do they issue permits when there are no wetlands?     I thought it was a permit allowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise would -- would not be allowed?       So, if they decide that there's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what do they do?     They do nothing?     Is that it?       Well, wait, wait.     Surely, you wouldn't go in and -- and try to fight arbitrary or capricious.     It's arbitrary or capricious or otherwise in violation of the law.     Wouldn't you go in and say that this is in violation of the law?       I don't think that one standard of review would do you very much good, to tell you the truth.     They've thought about this.     Maybe they got it wrong, but to say it's arbitrary or capricious, you're going to lose.       This wouldn't be a problem if -- if this procedure were not employed, if there were not this -- this prior compliance order that issues before actual suit by the -- by EPA to hold you liable for violating the Act.     Then you'd just have one -- one suit, and the -- the issue would be clear as to what burden the agency has to sustain.     But it's -- it's really the dual nature of this process that creates the difficulty, isn't it?       But that's in the statute. The agency didn't make that up, right?     The statute provides for compliance orders, and it calls them "compliance orders," doesn't it?       Of course, you know, you're -- you're not going to be out of the woods.     Even if you get this APA review, okay, some of the factual questions that go to whether these are wetlands or not are going to be decided giving substantial deference to the agency's determination of the facts, right?       And so, even if you lose on that, you might still think you can win when the EPA finally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a penalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without -- without any deference to its factfinding.     So, you still won't know where you are, will you?       You've lost one, but you may win the other.     You'll have to roll the dice.       Yes, but maybe the agency is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a record.     When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no reason to give it deference.       But they'll just issue warnings, is what they'll do.
10-1104 +++$+++        Do you want us to hold that there's no Bivens action in California?     Is that -- is that what our opinion is going to say?
10-1121 +++$+++        A material new assessment?       Okay.       That's -- we're talking about money here, right?       Okay.       Do you concede that it's going to make them better off?     I would -- I would assume that that's your principal objection.     They don't know whether this new assessment is indeed going to be divided the way the original one was or not.     They might want to challenge --       -- whether -- whether it's all going to be used for -- for assessable activities or not.     And they have no -- you're telling me they have no --       At the very least, they have to make a -- an interest-free loan to the -- to the union until such time as they can challenge it.       I assume we wouldn't need a Hudson notice at all, if -- if bishops affirmed all of these things, right? (Laughter.)       Isn't -- isn't the premise of Hudson that you give the notice before, before -- you receive the notice before you have to cough up the money?       And what's now proposed is, well, for -- if there's an additional assessment, you cough up the money first, and then later you straighten it out.     And I -- do you get -- do you get the interest?       Mr. Young, I hope this won't use up much of your time, but I do have a pressing question to make sure that we're just not spinning our wheels here. What if the union here had simply said all this additional assessment will go to bargaining activities, and then simply used its original assessment, the portion that had been anticipated to be used for bargaining, for political activities?     It could do that, couldn't it?       I mean, it's not committed to -- to, you know, an 80-20, or whatever the division is, simply because that's what's given out in the first notice.     It can indeed use its -- the anticipated portion for bargaining for political activities.       So, why are we wasting our time?     I mean, all the unions are going to do is say this is a general assessment for bargaining purposes, and then use their -- their general funds for the political thing.       Okay.     So, you win, and it'll never happen again.     It'll never again be called a segregated fund for politics. (Laughter.)
10-114 +++$+++        Well, wait.     I mean, my goodness.     You could say the same underlying facts justify, you know, a suit for -- for libel, and also justify a much -- a much greater suit.     I'm not sure that we look to simply the underlying facts.     We look to what kind of liability was sought to be imposed upon the defendant.     That's what determines how much money the defendant is willing to pay for his lawyer, and how much he has to expend in defending.       So how do you calculate that?     I mean that -- that's what the question was.       But that's not why we took the case, to correct the factual application.       So they messed up the application of the but-for test.     I thought the issue before us whether -- was going to be whether the but-for test is a proper test, not whether this particular court, having expressed a proper rule, misapplied it. I don't care about that.       I don't -- you -- you - you've done this several times in the course of your argument, sort of equating, you know, the attorney's fees for frivolous suits with the normal attorney's fees that the plaintiff gets when the plaintiff is victorious.     I'm not sure that we should treat the two situations about the same, because the plaintiff gets his attorney's fees whenever the plaintiff wins, whenever the plaintiff wins, whereas the defendant gets those fees only when the plaintiff has brought a frivolous suit, which should not have been done, which is wrongful, which is perhaps sanctionable under Rule 11.     I'm not sure that we have to evenhandedly apply the same kind of rules.
10-1150 +++$+++       I -- I'm not comfortable 2     with that.    I mean, it depends on how -- how broad it 3     is?      What about up to 700?    Is 9     that okay?      I mean, how are we supposed 16     to apply that kind of a rule?      Above -- above 830 or below 21     830?    Which?      Doesn't -- doesn't any -- 8     any medical patent rely on natural processes?    I mean, 9     even if you invent a new drug, what that new drug does is -- is natural.    It affects the -- the human 11     physiognomy --      -- in a certain natural 14     way.      Is it -- is it therefore 17     precluded from patentability?      What's different here? 21                 MR. SHAPIRO particular chemical formula, others can invent other 24     drugs.    There's room for competing drugs in the medical 25     world.    And you'll -- many, many patented drugs --      Well, that's another one of 17     your arguments, but one of your arguments says you can't 18     patent nature.      And that relates to the 23     question that I asked.      And tell me why you can't patent nature, then?      That's not what we're talking about here; we're not talking about novelty, are 2     we?      But once you say      Because it's novel. 20                 MR.

They -- they got      Would each of them be okay, 6     because it's --      That would be your defense. 17                 MR. SHAPIRO important to -- to doctors around the country. 2                 Now, is this a natural process?    The question was raised.    Of course, it's a natural process. 4     These metabolites come from the liver.    They don't come 5     from a test tube.    They don't come from a syringe.    It's 6     just like cholesterol.    If I eat in a French restaurant, 7     there's some human intervention there that gives me high 8     cholesterol.    And if I eat wild strawberries, there's no 9     human intervention.    But either way, the doctors get to 10     look at my cholesterol and hypothesize ranges that they 11     think are sensible.    It's the very same phenomenon. 12     Entirely natural. Now, this is a clean legal issue.    Under 14     section 101, it's always been a legal issue.    They say 15     section 102 and 103 are the most elusive questions in 16     the field of patent law.    This is a 7-year-old lawsuit 17     against a hospital; it's cost millions of dollars to 18     defend.    Two trips to this Court, two trips to the 19     Federal Circuit.    We're still litigating this treble 20     damages case.    It should be terminated under this 21     Court's precedents, as the district court did giving 22     summary judgment.
10-1195 +++$+++       Do you have anything more 17     than implication here?      Well, how is that?    I mean, 19     the description of the right of action is that it exists 20     only if permitted by the laws or rules of court of a 21     State.      That's fine.    Then where is 2     the creation of a private right of action bringable in 3     Federal court apart from State laws?    Where does that 4     exist in this statute?    I don't see it here.      Except that that's the only 9     section that creates a private right of action. 10                 MR. NELSON
10-1211 +++$+++        Mr. Bibas, I have -- this is almost a question of personal privilege.     You -- you make your whole argument on the basis of Landgraf.     So does the Government.     You do not cite -- the Government cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a -- of a later case which involved the same question, Republic of Austria v. Altmann. I concurred separately in Landgraf because I thought that the test that the Court was using, upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire constitutional case. But I said in my concurrence that the proper test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean to be applied only in the future or in the past?     And for that, I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said in Altmann: "Our approach" -- which postdates Landgraf. "Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the concurrence in Landgraf."     Quote, and it's quoting the concurrence:     "'The critical issue ... is not whether the rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates.     Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered. Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date.     But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relative retroactivity event'" -- "'relevant retroactivity event.'" And that is what we have here.     The -- the event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the United States, and it is clear that this statute applies only to prospective entry into the United States.     It doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who came in, in violation of this statute, can be deported. Now, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as we did in the Republic of Austria case?       Why would it be limited just to the foreign sovereign immunities context?       Why do you say that's the majority's approach?       Its -- its holding.       But there are a lot of -- but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be valid, and not retroactive, which have a substantial effect.     You can pass a statute altering the rules of evidence which have the effect of making someone who committed a prior murder convictable; whereas, before, he was not convictable. And we don't just look to the effect and say, well, it has that substantial effect; so, it's operating retroactively.     We say, no, it's a rule of evidence.     It applies in the future, and that evidence can come in. And that's my problem with this other approach.     There are often adverse effects upon activities that occurred before the statute was enacted, but we still regard the statute as prospective only and, therefore, not subject to special rules for people who are affected.       We're trying to figure out what Congress intended, right?     We're not talking about constitutionality.     We're talking about a rule that it's presumed that statutes are only prospective.     All right? And your argument is the reasonable expectation of Congress when they passed this was that it would only apply to -- to people who, what, committed the crime or were convicted after the statute passed --       -- just as a matter of statutory interpretation?       Okay.       And you think Landgraf is clear and settled, and you're -- you're over there in Congress, and you say, boy, I know how this statute is going to come out under Landgraf --       -- better than I am.       Well, that can be explained because Congress understands that who knows whether it's going to be held to be retroactive or not.     If you -- if you surely want it to apply, you'd better say so.     If that's the rule you want us to adopt, that's okay.

And on what basis does the court decide the case?     De novo?       Yes.       How close a predecessor is the predecessor?       Your case is stronger if it isn't new facts, right?     That's what you'd say.       Your case is stronger if in fact it's only new argument and not new fact.       Yes, but you have a strange statute here.     I don't know any statute that -- that reads this way.     "As the facts" -- "as the facts" -- where is it?     "As the facts may" --       "As the facts in the case may appear."     That's --
10-1259 +++$+++        Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to get to it now. (Laughter.)       I have to give a little prologue to my question.     When -- when wiretapping first came before this Court, we held that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment says that the -- the people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.     And wiretapping just picked up conversations.     That's not persons, houses, papers, and effects. Later on, we reversed ourselves, and, as you mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, is there an invasion of privacy?     Does -- are you obtaining information that a person had a reasonable expectation to be kept private?     I think that was wrong. I don't think that was the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment.     But, nonetheless, it's been around for so long, we're not going to overrule that. However, it is one thing to add that privacy concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally existed, and it is quite something else to use that concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it originally meant.     And it seems to me that when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an unreasonable search and seizure.     It is attached to the car against his will, and it is a search because what it obtains is the location of that car from there forward. Now, why -- why isn't that correct?     Do you deny that it's a trespass?       Well, that's too bad.     That doesn't make it a trespass.     I mean --       It may be a sneaky thing to do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass.       So, we've narrowed the Fourth Amendment?       So, the -- the privacy rationale doesn't expand it but narrows it in some respects.       Undoubtedly, but the rationale of that case was that it was not an unreasonable --       -- it was not an unreasonable search.       Don't we have any legislatures out there that can stop this stuff?

10-1293 +++$+++        That's one of their arguments.     I mean, another one is that you haven't defined it precisely enough, right?       That's a separate -- really a separate argument.       They have their own guidelines that generally prohibit it, don't they?       Sign -- sign me up as supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this Court and the people that attend other Federal courts.     It's a symbolic matter. And if this is  if these are public airwaves, the government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency.     I'm not sure it even has to relate to juveniles, to tell you the truth.       Well, you do more and more.       -- since there's so much of it on.       Maybe the third is you shouldn't interview these people.
10-1320 +++$+++        Well, that's the count.     The jury takes lots of votes.     Was it utterly clear that the jury could not go back and reconsider that?     Unless that was absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not been announced.     She just said how we voted the last time.       Excuse me.     Excuse me. When you say she was announcing a decision, then you mean they can't go back on it?       She was announcing a vote.       But that -- so long as it's still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter.     The jury could have -- suppose the jury went back after this announcement -- you know, we -- you know, we've decided on a -- on the greater charge, or we voted on the greater charge for the defendant.     Suppose they go back and one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser charge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says, well, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on the lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to acquit on the greater charge. Isn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in jury rooms all the time?       So, there is no certainty whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time would be the vote when they finally got done.       Only if --       Only if -- and I think this is the premise of your argument.     Only if there is a constitutional necessity to -- to sever the various charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the jury come in on one charge without coming in on the other.     It seems to me that's the premise of your argument.     And I don't know where that constitutional necessity comes from.       Your manifest necessity depends upon the necessity of severing, yes.     If you sever, then there is no manifest necessity of resubmitting the greater charge.     But it assumes -- it assumes a severing, and I don't know where the severing comes from.
10-1399 +++$+++        It seems to me that --       -- that the two parties are at extremes and that there is indeed something in the middle.     I mean, you say it has to be the determination of entitlement to compensation by the agency.     The other side says no, it's just entitlement, whether it's been decreed or not.     Why -- why wouldn't it be an award, however, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid the amount due, which is what he's supposed to do anyway, right?     Why wouldn't that be an award of compensation?       Yes, a sense that -- that the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense that the other side argues here.       Where -- well, I wish you would submit the sections of the Act that use it that way, that say "compensation without an award."       Okay.       Well, it's --       No, he doesn't.     No, he doesn't.     He can just begin payment.     This (c), which is the section we're talking about here, doesn't just provide for newly awarded compensation.     It also says "survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits." "Currently receiving."     Now, does that mean it has to have been decreed by the agency?     I don't think so.       That clause.       Yes.       I understand.     But it -- but it applies to the question, it seems to me, that Justice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it?       No?       But only if you've been receiving compensation.       Okay?     If neither the employment -- if neither the employer gives you the compensation voluntarily nor as you -- as you contend, there has been an award by the agency, you're out; (c) doesn't apply.     Right?       How else would it apply? You are either receiving compensation, which I would understand to mean receiving it from the employer or by reason of an award, or else you've been newly awarded compensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been paid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket.       It doesn't say that, counsel.     It says "survivors currently receiving compensation."     It doesn't say "by virtue of an award." It says "receiving compensation."     So, if the employer is paying it voluntarily, you're in there.     And then it goes on and it contrasts with receiving compensation those newly awarded compensation.     You're not yet receiving it, but you've been awarded it.       I understand that.       But I'm just trying to make sense out of the provision.     And it doesn't seem to me to make any sense unless you read it just the way I suggested.       It doesn't say that.     It says nothing about an award.     The last part talks about an award.     It says "currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits."     And if you're receiving it from your employer, I don't know why that isn't covered by that.     Why isn't it covered?       Yes.       I don't think it affects your case.     It's just a matter of understanding what this provision is talking about.       But if the employer has been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee for not having an award, right?     I mean he's in the same position; the employer has conceded the liability.       I don't understand why that's so only for employment -- for employer payments and not the case for awards.     If that's so for the employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have been decreed?     Why don't they change every year?       Okay.     So, then my reading makes perfect sense.       You don't really have to establish that, do you?     All you have to establish is that it is -- there is no way in which "newly awarded compensation" means entitlement to compensation.     That's all you have to establish.       You don't have to show that it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never used to mean entitlement to compensation.       Counsel, if I understood your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny that they are treated differently.     The one who is receiving compensation is treated the same, under the same provision.     There are two parts to it:     survivors currently receiving compensation and survivors newly awarded compensation. Those two classes are treated exactly the same.     The only one that is treated differently is somebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor has yet received an award.       No?       I see.     Partial disability, in other words.       Okay.       Counsel, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.     I mean, it seems to me you have to acknowledge it would be a much better statute had it been written differently.     And really your argument here is it's not up to us to revise the inadequacies of a statute.     I mean, your argument is you just can't read the language that way.     And it provides a stupid result.     There are such things as stupid statutes, and this is one of them, right?       Counsel, could I --       Could I ask you about another inconsistency in this section?     We've gone over one, which I think is there.     Isn't there a group left out of this thing, even under -- even under the Government's interpretation of it?     What happens to people who are receiving compensation for temporary total disability or for partial disability?     They don't -- they don't come under either one of those two categories, even under the Government's interpretation, right?       No, they haven't gotten an award yet.     They have not gotten an award yet, and they are only partially disabled or have temporary permanent disability.     They're -- they're not covered by (c), are they?       Oh, that's right, but they --       It doesn't take effect --       -- during that year.       Well, does that make any sense?       No, it doesn't.     But you say the statute doesn't make sense.       Well, you're -- you're making your case harder than it has to be, it seems to me, by saying that it always means an award of compensation by the agency. I -- I think in -- in 8(d), I don't think it means that, but it certainly means an amount due and not an entitlement.     It means an amount, a specific amount due, and that explains its meaning elsewhere, but that's quite different from saying that it means entitlement.       Oh, I think that's true, but only because of the earlier portion of 6(c) which -- which covers all other payments that are not by virtue of an award.       Receiving compensation.

Well, you didn't understand the question.       Webster's Third, as I recall, is the dictionary that defines "imply" to mean "infer" --       -- and "infer" to mean "imply." It's not a very good dictionary. (Laughter.)       I thought we're -- I thought we're addressing not whether it's a good idea to give fees, but whether fees are payable under this particular statute, right?     Which was enacted when?       1978.       That's not so long ago.       Do so without --
10-1491 +++$+++        Well, but -- but I find it difficult to understand why we -- we would not hold foreign sovereigns liable under this Act, that they're excluded despite -- despite its language; and yet, we cannot inquire whether persons other than sovereigns are covered.     What is -- what is the distinction between the two?       This is more specific than the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.     It deals with a much more narrow category of case.     And I do not think that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if indeed this statute provided for it.       Yes.       But it -- I didn't understand the point you just made, that the sovereign immunity part goes to?     To the conduct?       Why doesn't the corporate thing go precisely to the same question?       What's your position --       What's your position on aiding and abetting?     Is that -- is that a matter of our domestic law or would we track international law on that?       I don't care about the courts.     I care about you.     What's your position on aiding and abetting?
10-1542 +++$+++        I guess a child doesn't have any domicile except the parents'; right?     Children who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do they?       I suppose if they come with somebody else's 6-month-old child, they'd have to send that child back to China, too, wouldn't they?       Which would be very sad, but that would be the law, right?       They should not have sent him back to China, then.     Why did they do that? (Laughter.)       Counsel, I can't hear you very well.     Would you --       Can you crank up the thing or something?       Thank you.       Excuse me.     That first one usually cuts against the immigrant, I would assume.     So, if the parents knew, the child knows, and the child normally would not know, right?       Yes.       What do you respond to the point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also attributed?       Was that the case under the prior law?       Yes, when -- yes.       So, it's not unthinkable.
10-174 +++$+++        Mr. Keisler, what -- what good does it do you to have this Court say that there is no Article III standing?     The suit will just be brought in State court -       -- under State common law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not ours.       They only need one.       We're not sure about that, are we?     So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our wheels here.       Indeed, you know, tapping the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I would frankly rather have Federal judges do it, probably.       Well, the EPA is given authority to regulate other pollutants, including those that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter standards for its -- for automobiles in its State.       So why should we say the EPA preempts the Federal common law?       What's your best case?       This is a merits argument, right?       Of course, you're going to have to struggle with the preemption question sooner or later.     You're confident you can establish not only displacement of Federal common law, but also preemption of State common law, right?       I'll add a third thing that it goes to and that's Article III standing.     It's clear in our cases, if as you say the relief requested here will not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't have to go to prudential standing.     That it seems to me would deny Article III standing.       I don't understand why you assert that the remedy here will not provide the relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?       It does?     It does?     In Massachusetts v. EPA the relief was allowing a Federal agency to regulate the entire society's carbon emissions.       Do you think -- do you think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that EPA can only regulate the transportation section?       Is that the holding of the case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation?       Of course not.     Of course the case covers -       -- what the EPA could do.
10-179 +++$+++        But you don't say you waive it when -- when, in order to protect yourself for a debt that is owed to you, you make a claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.     We do have a doctrine that you cannot - you cannot condition a Federal right upon the waiver of constitutional protections.     And that seems to me what you're saying here.     If you want to get paid by the bankrupt estate, you have to waive your -- your right to a -- to a jury trial.       Would it have been normal for the bankruptcy judge to lift the stay with respect to a claim that could be presented in the bankruptcy proceeding?       That can't be right. You -- you can take all sorts of matters that belong in Article III courts, and so long as you place them in some other tribunal where somebody is coerced into coming in, supposedly voluntarily, it's all okay.     I mean, that's -- that's not an adequate protection.       A State can do that, but can the Federal Government make it the price that you pay for -- for going into a non-Article III tribunal?       It's a different situation, it seems.       Well, I would take that to mean you -- you brought it in here, and, you know, the same kind of argument that you were making.       Volenti non fit injuria. You chose to come into the court, and this is the spawn of your coming in.       I would -- well, I would rather say 27 months is too long.     That's --       That's timely.

10-209 +++$+++        You acknowledge, though, that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're -- well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged.     Let me ask you:     Have you provided ineffective assistance of counsel if you are a lousy bargainer?     You're just no good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game of bargaining.     And so, you do a bad job in bargaining down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job.     Is that ineffective assistance of counsel?       Well, I don't even agree with the first part.     I don't think our legal process is -- is a bargaining game.     Shouldn't be.       No, the difference -- that's not the difference at all.     It seems to me the difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.     When you plead guilty, you give up that. When you don't plead guilty, you get what is the best thing in our legal system.     You can't do any better than that.       So, your position is you're entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you plead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?       All right.       Mr. Jay, you disagree with the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was unfair.     This man deserved to get the sentence he got, didn't he?     He had a full and fair trial.     A jury of 12 people, finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, determined that he deserved that sentence.     How could it be unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved?       Mr. Jay, couldn't -- couldn't it be said that what our cases hold is that pleading guilty is a critical phase?     Would that be enough to explain our cases?

10-224 +++$+++        What about purchase?     What about -- what about the contract to purchase?     The California law addresses that.     Do you -- do you contend that that is pre-empted as well?       How so?       Or contract of purchase.     I mean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the slaughterhouse itself, they could make it unlawful for the -- the person who raises the animals to sell them when they're nonambulatory and unlawful for the slaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long as the contract is off the premises?       Okay.       And that presumably is why Congress excluded cats and dogs?       So, Lassie -- Lassie and Kitty are no good?       But Dobbin is all right.       But I guess the -- the State could make it unlawful for a rancher or -- what are the people that ship the animals to you called? Could it --       A rancher or farmer could make it unlawful for them to ship a nonambulatory swine, could they not?       Yes, but as far as this statute is concerned, it would not preclude a State law that forbids a -- a rancher to -- to ship a nonambulatory swine, right?       Do we have to peel this onion in order to decide this case?     I mean, do we have to go through --       -- each little provision of the statute and say this is in, this is out, this is in, this is out?       Can't we just either affirm or reverse the particular preliminary injunction that was -- that was issued here?       I'd like to get out of the work, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)
10-235 +++$+++        But juries usually find against railroads anyway, right?       Well, we have used that language.     You -- you have not responded to -- to the question where -- where did this language that does appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed standard, where -- where does that come from?       Apparently only FELA juries cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.       Your client is entitled to have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right? That's what you're arguing?       Juries disregard instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause. They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too.       But you're entitled to have them disregard the correct instruction rather than an incorrect instruction, right?       So the -- but the question is, what was your argument?     What was your side's argument?     Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause?       If that's true, that - everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable, but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the road.       This case go to the jury?
10-238 +++$+++        Mr. Maurer, suppose - suppose the government imposes a fine of $500 for all political speech, and people nonetheless continue to engage in political speech and pay the $500.     Would that make the $500 penalty for political speech constitutional?       Didn't they call it a subsidy in Davis?     I -- if I recall the argument, I think that's what -- what it was characterized as there, too.     Did they characterize it as a penalty?     I doubt it.       I didn't understand the hypothetical.     I really didn't.       I assume your opinion can be based upon Buckley, however. (Laughter.)       We have the contrary argue here.     I'm sure that in some of the public financing cases that we've heard argued, it was asserted that the purpose was to level the playing field, and that that was an entirely valid purpose.     I'm unaware that all public financing laws have had as their purpose simply to avoid corruption.       It's very clear, however. (Laughter.)

10-313 +++$+++        Did you get -- you get (c)(2) at TELRIC rates?       But you -- you want the incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment. And what they say is, no, you -- you bring your switching equipment here; we'll -- we'll allow you to connect at, you know, the end of our facilities; but, by God, you -- you make -- you make your own connection to -- to the switches. Now -- now, moreover, you're -- you're making them -- you'll pay them for the orange cord, but only at TELRIC rates, which are not realistic.     Now, why -- why are they wrong and you're right, especially when you have legislation, the purpose of which was to encourage the independent building of new facilities?     I mean, it's clear that the Act wanted these new entrants where -- where possible to build new facilities, and not simply to glom on to the extant facilities of the incumbents.       Well, but the logic of your case, as you described it, would also require AT&T to build out the orange cord.       Excuse me, excuse me.       Extant entrance facilities I assume they were referring to.       Okay.     Well --       Right.     But if you ask for a longer distance, they would presumably have to build it.       And charge you TELRIC rates.       Mr. Bursch, the -- the key to your case is -- is that an entrance facility is interconnection, right?       You have to equate those two -- those two terms.       What do you rely upon to equate them?     Because the -- as I read the regulations, they -- they use them as separate terms.       Doesn't -- doesn't the interconnection -- doesn't it have to be part of the internal system of the incumbent carrier?       What section are you referring to?     On page 10a?     Which one is it?       You -- you do not need to provide unbundled access under (c)(3) to entrance facilities, right?       It's a genus and -- and the entrance facility is the species --       -- in your estimation?       But there may be a -- a reason to give less weight to briefs in this Court, different from the briefs filed with a court of appeals. And you've taken a different position here on -- on the issue of whether, when backhauling is included, it's part of the -- it's -- it's part of the interconnection facility?       I do not think you made that distinction below about, you know, oh, it is part where there is back -- where there is not backhauling, but where there is, it isn't.       Wait.     They have to be as unbundled elements?     I thought they never had to be --       -- made available as unbundled elements.     That's (c)(3).       Your argument here is that only have to be made available under (c)(2)?       Which is not unbundled?       You certainly encourage us to throw up our hands.     There's no doubt about it. (Laughter.)       Why did they fight the Eighth Circuit litigation?     Why did -- I mean, it -- you're telling me it made no difference whether (c)(3) allowed them to do what they wanted to do and what the Eighth Circuit said they couldn't do, right?       Very slightly different. That's not that big a deal.       Incidentally, where do you -- where do you get that backhauling restriction from?       Yes, yes.     The --
10-382 +++$+++        Well, this is just the general purpose behind the exception to 301, right, the -- the exception for providing attorney's advice. The ordinary private litigant doesn't have to show, when he refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's some conflict which would make it harmful for him to turn that over, does he?       Not in the trustee context. I'm just talking about the normal operation.       And -- and so, once you establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not require the person who declines to turn over the information to show why it would really hurt him to turn it over, right?
10-444 +++$+++        Well, I -- I didn't understand that to be your position. There -- there is a statement in your brief that the question is whether plea negotiations that did not result in a guilty plea constitute a critical confrontation that gives the rise to effective assistance of counsel during such negotiations.     So, I thought your position was that so long as the plea negotiations don't result in a guilty plea, effective assistance of counsel doesn't even come into the equation.       I mean, you can say yes or no.     I mean, you could retract -- retreat from --       -- that, I suppose, if you want.       When they do not result in a guilty plea.       Yes, but we don't care about that.     You know, what do we care about that?     I mean, we don't take cases to figure out those -- those, you know, picky, picky factual questions.     The issue that I thought was important here is whether this is a critical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does not accept the -- the plea and plead guilty.       And if it were a critical stage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law, but if he was a bad negotiator.     I mean -- right?     Being a good criminal lawyer means you -- you got to be a good horse trader, right?       Yes.     You tell him to turn down a deal --       -- that in fact, you know, was a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective assistance of counsel.     So, you must -- you must know how to handle yourself in the used car lot, right?       No, but the guilty -- I mean, no, the reason that is not true is that the guilty plea must be entered with advice of counsel.     You acknowledge that, don't you?       So, the guilty plea doesn't erase everything if it has been entered without advice of counsel.       You have admitted that you got what you deserved, right?
10-507 +++$+++        Give me an example of a -- of an injury that occurs on the shelf that is not a consequence of operations conducted.     What -- just beachcombers out there, or what?       What are they doing out there?       Mr. Clement, I don't really understand proximate cause as applied to a -- a statute that provides for automatic liability rather than liability for negligence.     To say that it's a proximate cause of a particular act of negligence is one thing, and we have a whole body of law that gives guidance for that.     But do you know of any other situation where we talk of proximate cause, something proximately caused by operations?     Not by a particular act of negligence or -- I don't know how to apply proximate cause to an operation.       What reason did they have to use the terminology "as a result of" instead of simply saying that this Act applies only with regard to injuries on the platform, which is what other statutes did say?     I mean, other statutes had a geographical requirement.     What a strange way to say it, "as a result of operations."
10-5258 +++$+++        Why is -- why is -- why is the present tense inadequate for the -- for the government's position in this case?     Once it is conceded that the North Carolina law is not retroactive, the law reducing the number of years, it is the case that what is the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that he committed -- how many years ago was it, whatever -       What is the maximum punishment for that offense which occurred at that time is the longer period.     Why is -- I don't see why your argument requires us to ask what would be the term if he had committed the offense at a later date.     The maximum term for his offense when he committed it is those years because the State did not retroactively reduce his sentence.       It's not just for the defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to the -- prior to the amendment of the statute.       Anybody that committed it then, the -- the -- it is an offense "involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by law."     It is prescribed by law for any of those offenses that occurred between whenever that old statute was enacted and whenever this statute was enacted.       Excuse me.     That's -       That's correct?     You're happy with that?     The person committed a felony when it was a felony, and the State later no longer makes it a felony, and it isn't counted for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act?       -- but they're not the kind of a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that, you know, puts them away for 10 years. It seems to me that that's what the Federal law is looking to.     We're not giving over to the States the decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate somebody in a Federal prison.       I agree, it does refer to the seriousness of the offense.     But it refers to the seriousness of the offense at the time the offense was committed in order to determine how bad a fellow this is, not -- not because we want the States to determine how long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in prison.       That's the issue, though, really.       But you'll -- you'll put away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad a guy.     He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State later makes it a felony, you -- he suddenly comes under ACCA.     And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's what -- what Congress had in mind just because the State now thinks that it's more serious.     Who cares what the State thinks?     We -- we want to know how bad an actor this particular defendant is.
10-5400 +++$+++        Your client -       -- didn't get, did she?       So, if he gave her extra years in order to get that treatment, he just gave her extra years without the treatment, as it turned out?       The judge did say, didn't he -- this is on page 27 of the Joint Appendix -- "the sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed correctional treatment, and here I think the needed correctional treatment is the 500-hour drug program." It couldn't be clearer that he's computing the length of the sentence on the basis of what correctional treatment will be received.     It "has to be sufficient to provide needed correctional treatment."
10-5443 +++$+++        Are they all consistent?       What does that have to do with reasonable likelihood that it would occur?     I mean, he either intends it or he doesn't intend it.     What -       The realistic likelihood that this person who was killed might have gone to a Federal officer doesn't at all establish that the intent of the person who killed him was to prevent him from going to that officer, does it?       I mean, it seems to me you have to stand on one stool or the other one.     Either it -- it relates to intent, as the statute says, or all there has to be is a reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed would have gone to a Federal official.       Which is it?       No, no, that -- that's not what the statute says.     It doesn't talk about preventing a future act.     It doesn't say anyone who kills someone who would have gone to a Federal official is -- is subject to this penalty.       If that's what it said, your -- your realistic likelihood test would be quite reasonable, but it doesn't say that.     It says that the -- the killing has to be with the intent of preventing him from going.       You think a realistic likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt?       You think a juror can grasp all of that in a juror's mind?     You must find that there is -       -- that there is a realistic likelihood beyond a reasonable doubt?       I would think your answer would be that if that were the law, (a)(1)(C) would have omitted the word "Federal."       It would have said "by any person to a law enforcement officer."     And you would - you would eliminate "or judge of the United States" - "information related to commission or possible commission of a violation of the law," period.

Who have --       -- or have not transferred to any other person.       Oh.     Oh, the copyright.     I got you.       Would you -- would you spend a little bit of time on your other argument?     I take it to be a separate argument apart from the, you know, time limit argument, the argument that the problem here is that this law does not promote the progress of science and useful arts and, therefore, does not comply with the Copyright Clause.     Why doesn't it --       Why doesn't it promote the progress of science and the useful arts?       Let me put it -- I think it's the same point -- another way.     Let's assume I'm a multibillionaire, and I receive an award as a great patron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by giving several million dollars to someone who has already composed an opera or who has already written a book.     Wouldn't -- wouldn't I be furthering, be viewed as furthering, the arts?       But that's what the copyright law permits, the -- excluding things from the public domain so long as, in the process of doing it, you're furthering the arts.       Of course, the assumption of this -- of this line of questioning, I suppose, is that the mere marketing in the United States of stuff that has already been created promotes the progress of the useful arts.     I'm not sure it promotes the progress of the useful arts.     It makes more money for the guy who wrote it, but it doesn't incentivize anybody --       -- to create art.
10-553 +++$+++        I think your point is that it's -- it's none of the business of the government to decide what the substantial interest of the church is.       Can we try whether it's a sham?     I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a sham.       Is a sham different from a pretext? (Laughter.)       So, you would allow the -- the government courts to probe behind the church's assertion that this person is a minister?     You would allow that, right?     But once it is determined that the person is a minister, you would not allow the government to decide whether the firing was a pretext?       And that term is a legal term.     What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by the law, not by the church, right?       Okay.       What makes it not true? What is the legal definition of "minister"?     What is it? That you have to lead the congregation in their religious services or what?     What is it?       Okay, but this is -- you're saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway even if she hadn't been ordained; right?       Okay.       Might not the Establishment Clause have something to do with that question --       -- which applies to institutions?       Whereas the Free Exercise Clause applies to individuals, right?
10-568 +++$+++        Mr. Elwood, for me at least we've -- we've jumped way ahead.     I'm not so much concerned about the vagueness as I am about the proposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures for voting are subject to review by this Court or by any court under the First Amendment.     This is the first case I'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an allegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in years in Federal courts. And it's certainly not because legislative rules have not been vague.     The first Congress adopted a rule that, quote, "No member shall vote on any question in the event of which he is immediately and particularly interested."     I don't consider that very precise.     And the rules adopted by Thomas Jefferson for the Senate, "Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or question, he is to withdraw."     "The private interests," what does that mean?     "And where such an interest has appeared, his voice is disallowed, even after a division." Now, that's been around in our Congress forever, but our Constitution provides that -- that the rules of the legislature are to be determined by Congress and not by this Court, and I am sure we would not, we would not review those rules.     Now, is there a contradiction between leaving those rules to Congress and the First Amendment?     Do you really think that - that the two are set in opposition to each other?       You're ending up skirmishing on what seems to me a less significant aspect of this case.     This case is enormously important on that major question.     I'm not inclined to resolve it on the question, well, you know, this is too vague. I mean, it's even vaguer than what the first Congress adopted.     It seems to me that just opens, opens the door to future litigation challenging ethical rules, which - which does not make me happy.       Well, and if they did we would review it.       Isn't that nice.     But the cases come up here anyway, right?       Look, fighting words are words.     They are speech.     There's no doubt that they're speech.     And it's a considerable question whether the vote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the first -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting speech or something else, whether it's speech.     It's a vote.       You may be willing to, but I'm not.       Mr. Elwood, why is that extraordinary?     Why aren't you willing to accept that? I mean, if -- if the Speaker of the House counts the votes wrong and he says the ayes have it when it's obvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that?       Is there any greater violation of the principles of democracy than counting the votes wrong in the legislature?     Yet that matter is not reviewable here, is it?       So why is it extraordinary that this one should not be reviewable?       Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the protection that all of the legislators are subject to it.     So if it's vague for Mr. Carrigan in this case, it's vague for everybody else as well.       And so it's sort of a self-regulating mechanism.     You -       You have to be willing to abide by whatever -- whatever vagueness and whatever ethical rules you -- you have opposed -- imposed on somebody else.
10-577 +++$+++        How would you prove fraud and deceit beyond proving that the person lied, intentionally lied?     What -- what is added to intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or deceit?       Isn't intentionally lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive?       It doesn't?       You must know that it's false when you say it.     Isn't that what "willfully" means?     You must know that the statement you're making is false.       I don't want another adverb.       I want you to describe what it means in the context of a statement.     Doesn't it mean that you have to know that the statement you are making is false?     Isn't that enough for willfulness?       Okay.     Now, you tell me what deceit involves beyond that.       Do you have the text of it?       I don't like counsel getting up here and talking about statutes that they've never put before us.     If you're going to rely on it, we -- we would like to have the text somewhere.       Well, why?     Because it wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a willful lie.     It would be adding to the -- to the fraud and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie. It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I just ain't gonna pay it.     There's no fraud and deceit there.     It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to evade or defeat tax.       That's right.     That's my very point.       Without lying -- without lying -- without making a single lie.       Yes.     And my point is that it would not have been included within (M)(i).     There is no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it does not involve fraud or deceit.     It does not involve a lie, as 7206 does.       An attempt to evade or defeat -- "who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax."     And one can do that without lying. One can do that by simply not report income, for example.     Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful example, by going to Cuba.     Was it Cuba or somewhere else? (Laughter.)
10-6 +++$+++        And that's okay, as far as you're concerned?     You would consider that comes within your first test?       Would not, but willful blindness would?       So even willful blindness wouldn't be enough?       Well, why -- why wouldn't you tell him?     If you're -- if you're honestly interested in finding out whether there is a patent that you're infringing, why wouldn't you tell me the reason we're concerned is that we have reverse-engineered this from somebody else's product?     Just check to see if SEB has a patent on any of this stuff that we've reverse-engineered.     That's what I would have done.       Was their practice to reverse-engineer from other people's products?       I mean, I can understand when you have a new product of your own; of course, you just give it to an attorney.     But when you have reverse-engineered, not to tell them that it was reversed-engineered seems to me really trying to keep yourself in the dark.     What you want to get from the attorney is a piece of paper that he can show to Montgomery Ward that, yes, this product is not -- as it turns out, Montgomery Ward did accept it and got hit with liability for infringing a patent.     I -- I find that really incredible that, in an honest attempt to find whether there was any patent infringement going on, you wouldn't even tell the patent attorney that you've reverse-engineered somebody else's product.       No, they wouldn't.       Well, we're not going to adopt a special rule for the deep-fryer industry. (Laughter.)       Especially -       Listen, the -- the reason you got the opinion from the lawyer was -- was not to make sure that there were no patents.     It was to show that opinion to Montgomery Ward.       As a practical matter, you needed an opinion from a lawyer, because otherwise, Montgomery Ward was not going to sell this stuff.       No, more than that.
10-63 +++$+++        Who says so?     Who says so? Who says that they rely on -- you have a local attorney, and you have to have a local attorney for the case, don't you?     And -- and you want us to believe that the local attorney is -- has no responsibility for the case at all?     Is this really what the -- what the law requires?     I -- I think there is a serious ethical obligation when he has the -- when he gets the notice. He is one of the attorneys for your client.     And he got the notice, right?     That one was not returned.       He failed to check with -- with the New York lawyers who were working with him. Why is it -- why is the State responsible for that?       But, you know, even if local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a functionary, surely the function would include when he gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people who do the real work know about the notice.       He didn't perform that function.       To whom did he make that clear?     You said he made it clear at the outset.     To whom?     And where is that in the record?       His affidavit after -- after the fact, right?       Did -- did he tell the clerk of the court that that was the case?       Yes, you know, I'm counsel of record.     He's the counsel of record, right?     I'm counsel of record, but I don't even do so much as to forward notices to the guys that are doing the real work?     Did he tell the clerk that?       That's extraordinary.       Where does the Constitution say, by the way, that you have to give notice, that every judicial action has to be noticed --       -- to the parties to the case?     The Federal rules don't -- don't require notice, do they?       And the Federal rules don't say it.     You don't have to give notice in the Federal rules, do you?       Capital cases are different?     If you're going to go to jail for life you -- you don't get notice, but if -- if it's a capital case --       No, I mean, it's either a rule for all criminal cases or it's not a rule.       And if -- if it's a rule for all criminal cases, the Federal rules are unconstitutional, you're saying.       Once you're in court and you have a lawyer, it's up to your lawyer to follow what goes on in the court.     That's the assumption of the Federal rules.     And it seems to me a perfectly reasonable assumption.     And I'm not about to hold that -- that they are unconstitutional simply because an extraordinary requirement of notice, which is not required by the Constitution, has gone awry.       He can't define his role as a lawyer.     Once he appears before a court and says, I am counsel of record, he has certain responsibilities. It's not up to him to say what his responsibilities are.       And if they don't extend even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the people who were doing the legwork in the case know that -- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't imagine what his responsibility is.     It's not up to him to define it.       Do we know that he knew all of those facts?       Of course, we don't know that.       Mr. Garre, can I go back to Justice Kennedy's question?     This was not an appeal. The question was how many capital cases is there no appeal.     He had been convicted and had appealed, right? The -- this is --       The direct proceedings were over.     He had appealed up to -- up to the State supreme court.     Did he seek cert here, too?       He did.     And this was a postconviction --       That may be, but I don't think it's extraordinary that there be no appeal, I mean, postconviction.       It can be allowed, but it would not seem to me extraordinary that it not be sought.       What -- what is the line, Mr. Garre, between abandonment and just plain old negligence?       So, if this local counsel simply goofed in not -- not advising the people that were doing the legwork in the case, why -- why is that abandonment?       But it seems to me it's up to you to produce the facts that would justify our reversing the case that you're asking us to do.       And you say, well, we don't have these facts; well, send -- send it back so I can -- no, you should have gotten the facts in the first place. If the record doesn't show the things that you need to show to get this case reversed, the case should not be reversed, it seems to me.       When did you first make the abandonment claim?       When was it?     Wasn't it first made in the -- in the request for rehearing?       That's rather late.       That isn't abandonment. That isn't abandonment.     The attorneys' actions established cause; that does not mean abandonment to me.       We don't have to adopt the State's position that he was not abandoned.     We have to adopt your position that he was abandoned.
10-637 +++$+++        Yes, the decision -- what decision did the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania make other than the decision not to hear the case?
10-6549 +++$+++        But it's a lot closer to prosecutorial discretion than -- than what you're asking us to accept, that something is a crime only if the Attorney General says it's a crime.     That seems to me very strange.       And your argument is further that without the rule, SORNA doesn't exist, right?       Right.
10-680 +++$+++ 
10-694 +++$+++        How do you explain -- I mean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake and Brieva changed the law.     How do you explain the language in Matter of Wadud, which antedates by a good deal those two cases, 1984, which says:     "Section 212(c) can only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the ground of deportation charged is also a ground of inadmissibility."     It seems to me that that's -- that's the basic point.       Well, reliance on confused law is certainly not reasonable reliance.     I mean, if you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan operates from, how can you say that -- that you're reasonably relying on confused law?       Well, that's a -       That's a different point.       But that -- what you say even further reduces the significance of the 212(c) possibility of waiver to the person pleading guilty. You're saying -- you're saying, yes, even though -- even though you couldn't get it under 212(c), there are a lot of other ways you might have gotten it.       But -       Okay, but there's a large category of people who -- who plead guilty to crimes that do not involve moral turpitude and yet are not otherwise excludable under 212(c), right?
10-699 +++$+++        Mr. Lewin, you're -- it seems to me you're not arguing for a co-equal congressional power; you're arguing for a superior congressional power.     You're saying whatever Congress says, the President has to comply with.     Now, that's quite different from saying that they both have authority in the field.     And if they both have authority in the field and they're exercising it in different fashions, I frankly would not be inclined to intervene. I would let -- I would let them conduct the usual inter-branch hand wrestling that goes on all the time, which probably means that if Congress cares enough, Congress will win because, as you say, it has an innumerable number of clubs with which to beat the executive. But if -- if the power is a co-equal power and they're both exercising it in a -- in a different way, why don't we just, you know, let them go at it? Why is it any of our business which is the better foreign policy position?       Congress is supreme, then? That is your position.     Not -- not that Congress has co-equal authority with the executive, but Congress is supreme.       What -- what were we scrutinizing in the Steel Seizure case?       And what presidential power would have supported that, the war power?       Right, because he was claiming that the Korean War -       -- required that these - that these companies remain in business.     And I guess we did scrutinize that.     What did we conclude, that that was -       But -       But a personal identification choice can also have significant foreign policy implications, can it not?     Is -- is that an either-or situation? What the State Department is saying is to allow this particular personal identification choice may antagonize some foreign nations that we don't want to antagonize. What if they gave them the choice of saying "Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East"?     Okay? That's their choice.     They can have that on their passport.     Would that be okay?
10-704 +++$+++       But it isn't good faith 4     here; that's the problem, that we don't have a good 5     faith test.    We -- we have a test that goes beyond good 6     faith.    Even if the officer is in good faith, according 7     to the test we've set forth, if he's so stupid that -- 8     that he -- he executes a warrant that no reasonable 9     officer could think was correct, he's -- he's in the pot, right?      We don't have a good faith test for this purpose.      So, whenever -- I'm sorry. 20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS about this, right?      But the -- the warrant 18     didn't just authorize, you know, firearms wrapped in 19     gang colors.    It allowed him to search for any evidence 20     of gang membership, right?      But what possible purpose 23     could that serve?      So, all that the finding of 8     gang membership decals or whatever they wear -- all that 9     would show is, indeed, this guy was a gang member.      And even then --      But they -- they knew he 17     was in that premise.    I mean, that -- I really don't 18     understand how you can possibly search for indicia of 19     gang membership.    When you know the man's a gang member, 20     so what?      And what does that depend 9     on, whether you would look for the indicia of gang 10     memberships in places where you wouldn't look for guns; 11     is that it?      Well, if you're looking for 18     photographs that show gang membership, I guess you could 19     look through photograph albums.    You wouldn't really 20     look there for guns, would you?      -- a good faith test for 9     this as we do in other -- in other --      Well, I don't like this 20     mishmash.    Look, it's either good faith or it's -- 21     however good his faith was, however well he showed his 22     good faith by checking with his superiors or what not, 23     if he made -- if he made an incompetent decision, it's 24     incompetent.    And we should not mix the two, it seems to 25     me.      That would be wonderful if 15     the test was, was this -- did this officer know that 16     this was a bad affidavit and was acting in bad faith in 17     executing it?    If that was the test, then indeed the 18     fact that he had checked with his superiors and all of 19     that good stuff would -- would have some relevance. 20                 MR. SRINIVASAN      Of course, you could say 9     that about any test, you know?    If you apply it protectively, it will protect.      And if you don't apply it 13     protectively, it won't protect.      I'd like a test that, you 16     know, that protects when it ought to and doesn't protect 17     when it ought not.
10-708 +++$+++       Well, but --      -- let's assume that a 6     trustee acts on its own interest and sells property, but 7     let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property, 8     so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of 9     anything.    What's the injury to the beneficiary? 10                 MR. PANNER that are -- in the ordinary case, then, the beneficiary 15     has the option to say I'd like to unwind that or get the 16     benefit that the trustee got, if there was self-dealing. 17     But in a circumstance where a trustee sells, for example, a piece of property and the -- and the claim is 19     one for restitution to try to unwind the transaction 20     that was done, it's the option of the beneficiary to 21     say:    You know what, maybe I am wrong, but I think I 22     would be better off if I could undo that transaction. 23                 So, it's a very conventional kind of harm 24     where someone believes that their property was -- was 25     taken away from them and used in a way to their detriment, and they are therefore seeking relief.      We don't require 21     injury-in-fact for most breaches of trust, do we?      Well, I understand, but I'm 8     just saying that that concrete interest can be created 9     by Congress instead of being created by contract.    What 10     difference does it make?    If you become a trustee by 11     contract, you get one result; but if you are a trustee 12     by government decree so that you must be a trustee, 13     contract or not?      Somehow the situation 16     changes?      Not yours and his? 17                 (Laughter.)      What about a -- I'm sorry 3     to interrupt your -- your concluding remarks, but I am 4     troubled by the dollar nominal damages for breach of 5     contract.    What do you say about that?
10-76 +++$+++        We haven't resolved a whole lot if we leave that question open, have we?     You want us to write an opinion that says, unless you -- unless you ignore the separate corporate existence of the subsidiary -- parenthesis, a question on which we express no opinion, close parenthesis -- there can be no jurisdiction in cases like this?     Is that the kind of an opinion that the world is waiting for?       I thought you were saying we should not even -- not even address the situation where there is no special basis for ignoring the -- the separate incorporation.     I -- of course, we should not get into questions of whether, in fact, the subsidiary was a sham -       -- that there was control, all of that, but the simple question of whether, when you have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are your actions.       Don't we have to reach that?       What about special jurisdiction?     Why don't -- why we decide this on the basis of special jurisdiction?     It's an accepted basis of jurisdiction.     Citizenship is.     Countries can make it a crime -- in fact, I think Italy does -- to kill an Italian citizen abroad, and that person can be tried for that crime in Italy.     So I assume that -- that that is an acceptable basis of jurisdiction. So why don't we say that there's a specialized jurisdiction when a citizen of -- of North Carolina is -- is injured abroad, so long as there is - what -- what is the word?     The submission to the -- to the courts of North Carolina by having enough contacts with North Carolina.     The previous case -- what's that crazy word that's -       Why -- why don't we decide it that way?
10-779 +++$+++        But they could use it for other purposes, right?       Right.       So what the Chief Justice suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them from using it in order to market their drugs?       That's right.       Well, that's right, but that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the marketing of drugs.     You're -- you're placing that impediment on it.     Isn't that the obvious purpose of it? I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but let's not quibble over what the purpose is.       That's the purpose.     That's the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this information to market their drugs.       But it's only for that use that you interpose the requirement that the doctor consent.     For all other uses you don't require the doctor's consent, right?       So -- so the data is not private in the sense that the physician who prescribes knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and how much he prescribes and how often, because there are a lot of people who do know that, right?       So the only thing it assures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the basis of their knowledge of information which other people have, approach him in order to market their drugs?     That's basically all it assures the prescribing physician, right?       And, and he could achieve the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to talk to the marketer.     When the marketer says, you know, I want to talk to you about a new drug, he says:     I don't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.       How does it increase the prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data about his prescribing can only be given away but can't be sold?     Does that make him feel happier about his privacy?       He can do that by saying I don't want to talk to you.       That may well be, but then just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their privacy.     Now you're arguing a totally different purpose:     It makes it easier for the physician to cut off approaches by drug companies that want to sell drugs.     If that's the purpose of this statute, it's quite different from protecting his privacy.     His privacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but you can give it away.       The information necessary for effective speech is what you're saying, right?       It only restricts the information necessary for really effective speech?       They're looking for it because it -- it identifies those doctors that they would like to approach with their information which may say, you know, our product is much better than the generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever. There are arguments on both sides of those things.     And you are making it more difficult for them to speak by restricting access to information that would enable their speech to be most effective.       Well, that's an important position.     If you -- if that indeed was the meaning of the statute, you should have told the court of appeals, don't you think?     Is it enough to say we didn't say no? You should have said yes.     You should have said this is what it means.       But it doesn't protect his privacy.     I mean, the -- his name and -- and the extent of his prescriptions can be given away for a lot of uses.     It doesn't protect his privacy.       It protect -- it enables him to protect himself against drug companies that want to talk to him.       All right, so long as I know that's what you're talking about.     When you say "privacy," you don't mean the prescriber's concern that people will know that he prescribed certain drugs.     He doesn't care about that, right.       That is not protected by this law.       It's not protected by this law.       I'm talking about what this law protects.     It does not protect his privacy in that sense.     It protects his privacy in the sense that it enables him to avoid having to say go away when a salesman for the -- for the -- for the drug company comes, right?       You mean it doesn't even protect his privacy in the sense that it enables him not to have to say go away.     It doesn't even protect that. They -- he -- he will still have to say that -       -- if the drug company approaches him without having this information.       All right.       Can the State enact a law that, say, petition signers cannot approach somebody unless he has given his prior consent?       Of course not.       Doctors can do that if they don't want to talk to the -

Okay.     What about the person who instigates the instigator?       Well, somebody who comes up to somebody and says:     You know, you ought to -- you ought to --       -- try to start a prosecution against this person.     They say:     Yeah, that's a good idea.     So, that person goes and -- and gets a prosecution started.       The person who instigates the instigator?       So, the instigator of the instigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be?       And you know what the next question's going to be, right?       The instigator of the instigator of the instigator.     I mean, does this go back forever?       I don't understand.       I really don't understand this.     You have one witness in the grand jury proceedings.     That's the only witness.     Can that witness fall within your rule and be the complaining witness?       Just on the basis of the testimony alone?       So, it's pretty risky to testify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right?       Because even though you haven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way or not.     You're subpoenaed, and even though you're subpoenaed, you're going to hold me as a complaining witness.       Well, the affiants came forward.     I mean, that -- that's a different situation, isn't it?     They, indeed, were self-starting.     But the person who is subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury is not self-starting.     And you're saying that that person's mere presence and the mere fact of that person's testifying is enough to hold him to be the complaining witness.       Yes.       Hard or impossible?       Hard or impossible?       Okay.     That's a different word.     Thank you.     So, the testimony alone cannot be the basis?       Okay.       Well, you're saying that the only people who would be subject to suit for the malicious prosecution tort were complaining witnesses?

10-844 +++$+++       Not just "did not claim a 23     use."    And we have to fill in, that is "the use asserted 24     by the generic."    That's a strange thing to fill in. 25                 MR. HURST quibbling with the fact that this could -- the statute 2     could have been written more elegantly.    My guess is 3     that almost every statute this Court is asked to 4     construe, there are different ways that it could have 5     been written to resolve the issue in question. 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:    It's not a matter of elegance.    It's a matter of how I would have expected it 8     to be -- to be framed if it meant what you -- what you 9     say it means.    It's so easy to say "does not claim the 10     use asserted by the generic."    My goodness.    And that's 11     what you say it means.      And -- and the way you're 24     talking, you seem to assume that all the problems in the 25     world have to be addressed by this statute.    Would you have no remedy by -- by suing the FCC for accepting uses 2     that -- that it should not have accepted?      That's true, but it -- but 8     if you have alternative remedies, I am not terribly 9     shocked by the fact that you don't have a remedy under this statute.      Well, it's -- it's -- the 25     issue is not whether Congress enacted it only for that.      It's conceivable. 11                 MR. HURST
10-8505 +++$+++       Well, that would just show 7     that the material went to and came back from the lab. 8     It wouldn't show what the lab results were.    It was the 9     results that she testified to, right?      Well, it would be utterly 20     irrelevant, would it not, if the statements were not 21     true?    I mean, it's one thing for an expert to testify 22     about a hypothetical, you know But this was not -- nobody asked -- asked her to assume those things at all.    She testified 2     that -- that she had a match between what she had done 3     and what had been done on the -- on the DNA of this 4     individual by somebody else.      That seems to me quite 7     different from the -- from the ordinary hypothetical put 8     to an expert.      You're not objecting to 24     hearsay, are you, counsel?    You're objecting to a 25     violation of the Confrontation Clause --      -- which is quite different 3     from what -- what Mr. Wigmore was writing about, which 4     was hearsay.      We've said the contrary, 9     though, haven't we? (Laughter.)      Justice Breyer dissented from those opinions. (Laughter.)      It's up to the prosecutor 11     which of those 12 he wants to bring in, whether he wants 12     to bring in all 12 or just 1.    If he thinks the jury 13     will be sufficiently persuaded by bringing in just one, 14     he can bring in just one, right?      I think we should give it deference where deference is due and not give it
10-875 +++$+++       But -- but the problem is 24     that, with an exception that -- that's not applicable 25     here, section 1399 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that no separate taxable entity shall result from the 2     commencement of a case under Title XI of the United 3     States Code. How can you incur a tax when you are not a 5     separate taxable entity?      Well, if -- if that      Now, if there is an additional exception for chapter 12 of the sort that you 3     allege, why wasn't that put in there?      What does it mean, then, to 13     say that no taxable -- "no separate taxable entity shall 14     result"?    What does it mean, unless it means that it is 15     not the estate which incurs the tax?      Well, but they -- but they 23     would not have needed the exceptions for chapter 7 and 24     chapter 11 where the debtor is an individual if what you 25     say is true, if indeed a bankrupt estate is, as you say, not an entity at all.
10-879 +++$+++        You -- you would say once there's an accident and the locomotive is disabled, it's no longer in use.     I suppose that's what you'd say.       It's unrealistic, but that's what you'd say.       Don't you think that one of the purposes of the legislation, which everybody understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be able to construct their engines without having to worry about a variety of different State requirements? Railroading is a national transportation industry, and whoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this way, it's going to be okay.       And you're saying it won't be okay because, although every State may have -- every State's requirements may be pre-empted when the -- when the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have different requirements with respect to what the design has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's being repaired.     I think that truly frustrates the purpose of the Act.       I'm not -- I'm not concerned about conflict pre-emption.     I'm not concerned about State requirements that conflict with the Federal. I'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict with each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to all 50 States instead of looking to the Secretary here, which says your engine is safe if you do this.     And you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume that.       Well, what -- what self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that "safe for use" does not include safe for use when it's being repaired.       Do you have any --       I'm sorry.     Go ahead.
10-895 +++$+++        How do you decide whether it's a jurisdictional bar?     You acknowledge that the issuance by a judge of a certificate of appealability is a jurisdictional step; right?       That is jurisdictional.     If he doesn't do that, there's no jurisdiction.       Okay.     So -- so, the issue is whether (c)(3), which says the certificate of appealability "shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required," whether that provision is a requirement for the validity of the certificate of appealability.     If it is, then there's no jurisdiction, because the certificate of appealability is invalid.       Isn't that right?       Well, let's take the Fourth Amendment, I mean, which says, "no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause."     Okay?     So -- but then it goes on, "supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized."     Is the warrant valid if indeed it does not meet those requirements of being supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the --       It won't be valid.     It will just be invalid.       Ms. Millett --       -- it seems to me you beg the question when you say that the issue is whether the appeal will go forward.     That's precisely what -- what the issue is here, whether it is that the appeal will go forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will go forward.     That's exactly what we're talking about.       And it seems that the structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward on a particular issue, and not in -- not in general on -- on who knows how many issues.       It says it doesn't come forward -- doesn't come forward unless there is a certificate of appealability.       And then it says the certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.       I mean, I read that as saying you -- we're going to have an appeal but just an appeal on the issue that's identified.       Well, but --       You've done everything humanly possible, and just because of the mistake of a -- of a district judge, it can't go forward.     But that happens. What if the district judge does -- makes a mistake and -- and he thinks that there has not been a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right?     He makes a mistake about that.     What happens?       The same -- the same terrible result --       Ms. Millett, as I understand the State, the State is not contending that (c)(2) is jurisdictional.     So, you're -- you're arguing against a position they haven't taken.     They -- they don't say that there's no jurisdiction if in fact there has been no substantial showing, so that the court of appeals has to review that.     They're just saying that (c)(3), which describes the content of the -- of the certificate of appealability, is in effect jurisdictional.       So, I think you're -- you're exaggerating the consequence of what the State is urging us to hold here.       Right.     The State wouldn't go into that.     They're --       Where -- where is 2244(d)(1)?     I looked in your brief.       To the petition for cert?       Why isn't it in your brief? I mean, it's what your brief's about.     Why isn't it in the appendix to your brief?     It's also not in the appendix to the Government's brief.     It's also not in an appendix to the State's brief.     I have to go back to the -- to the petition to get it.     I mean, it's what we're talking about here.     I don't understand why the text is not -- is not in your brief, but that's --
10-8974 +++$+++        Mr. Guerriero, if it's not -- if it's not limited to suggestive circumstances created by the police, why is unreliable eyewitness identification any different from unreliable anything else?     So, shouldn't we look at every instance of evidence introduced in criminal cases to see if it was reliable or not?       Do you think that our cases which exclude or -- or require reversal when there's eyewitness testimony impaired by the police -- you think that's really limited to eyewitness testimony?     Suppose the police created suggestiveness in another category of evidence.     Let's say -- let's say voice evidence, that the killer had left a message on the -- on the phone. And the police in some manner create suggestiveness that causes a witness to identify that as the voice of the killer.     You really think that we would say, well, this is not eyewitness testimony; eyewitness testimony creates a special risk?     Don't you think that we would say, whenever the police render evidence unreliable, it -- it should be excluded?       Exactly.     But that -- that impairs your argument, because if we accept your argument for eyewitness, we should similarly accept it for everything else.     There's nothing special about eyewitness.       No, I'm saying we don't mean it. (Laughter.)       I'm saying that it's unbelievable that if the -- if the police created testimony, not eyewitness testimony, but testimony that was unreliable because of police suggestiveness, I think we would throw that out as well.     Don't you think so?       What about -- what about unreliable eyewitness testimony in favor of the defendant?     Let's assume the same suggestiveness that causes you to exclude it when it's been introduced by the prosecution, but here it's being introduced by the defendant to show that it was somebody else, okay?     Is that going to be excluded?       Do you think it should be excluded under the rules of evidence?     If you say it's so unreliable -- this is a one-way door?       All of the evidence that -- that causes the defendant to be convicted is excluded, but -- but any -- any evidence -- any evidence on the other side is not?       No, but you see, when -- when it's the State that causes the unreliability, I can see why it is a -- a ground that can be invoked only by the defendant.     But when you come up with a theory that it doesn't matter whether the State was the cause or not, I don't know why it wouldn't work both ways, that the evidence is inherently unreliable, and it ought to be excluded whether it helps the defendant or hurts the defendant.       Once you take the State out of the mix, there's no reason to limit it to the -- to the defendant.       Well --       Why not?     I mean, that's the point.     Why not?     What about an eyewitness identification from 200 yards?     You know, normally you'd leave it to the jury, and the jury would say that's very unlikely.     But you want to say it's -- it has to be excluded, and if it's not, you retry the person.     What is magic about suggestiveness as opposed to all of the other matters that could cause eyewitness identification to be wrong?       Tell that to the jury. What jury isn't going to be -- I mean, the more persuasive your argument is, the more likely it is that a jury will take care of that.
10-930 +++$+++        You -- you don't think that AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees?     Do you think Rees would come out the other way after AEDPA?       That's a different point.       In all cases?       Well, I don't really understand why the American Psychiatric Association said 6 to 9 months, too.     I mean, 90 percent are cured within months, right?       So you don't have to follow them in that non sequitur, it seems to me.       Because they are not lawyers, right?     They are psychiatrists.       Well, what's a reasonable extension?       Another 4 months?     6 months?       I was with you.     It seemed to me you had something really, really clear and solid, until you said, "reasonable extension."       Is that any different from what the defendants are arguing here?       They're saying, you know, give a -- give a temporary stay and extend it as long as -- as you need to.       So you're taking their position.       "Could provide" means might provide; is that it?     Might?       So just a possibility --       -- that's all it takes?
10-945 +++$+++        Mr. Goldstein, what -- what you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of what they have.     But what you're asserting is that the Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard practice, to strip search people who were admitted to prisons.     So, how could it be deemed an unreasonable invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?       That is somehow less of an intrusion -       -- on your privacy, to be naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than one jail official inspecting?       Mr. Goldstein, you -- YOU have acknowledged that we have held that when you have visitors, you may be strip -- strip searched after the visit and the same kind of close examination that you object to here.     Now, your explanation why that is okay is that that is voluntary.       That you don't have to have visitors.     Can you really condition your -- your having visitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights?       Are -- are you sure about that?       You can -- you can condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver of constitutional privileges?       I can understand that -- I can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why for the search to see that -- if the person has any fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other communicable disease before he's put into the general population?     Are -- are felons more likely to have those than non-felons?       So, that line makes no sense for that aspect of the search which is -- is just we want to make sure that we have a clean prison.       And that -- that's where the Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be drawn?     If you're examined close up by someone who has a medical degree, it's okay?     And, on the other hand, if it's someone who does not have a medical degree, it's not okay?       That can't be the line as to whether your privacy is being invaded.
10-948 +++$+++        I'm not sure that a settlement is a waiver anyway.     It's a vindication.     You -- you vindicate your right to a settlement.     I don't know that you waive it.
10-9646 +++$+++        What about 50 years?     Is that -- is that too much?       Well, you know, once -- once you depart from the principle that we've enunciated that death is different, why is life without parole categorically different from 60 years or 70 years or -- you know, you'd be back here next term with a 60-year sentence?       Okay.       Good.       I'll change my -- I'll change my question to 50 years without possibility of parole.       Then you have no -- no distinction, right?       Without --       How about 15 years old? 15, 60 years; or 14, 70 years?       What -- what's the distinction between 14 and 15?       I understand, but how are we -- how are we to know where to draw those lines?     We can't do it on the basis of any historical tradition, certainly.       The common law left it up to the jury to take account of the youthfulness of the offender.       They're all entitled to jury trial, right --       -- before they're --       You mean we --       How -- how do I come to that decision?     What do I -- just consult my own preferences on this matter?     Something like 39 States allow it.     I mean, the American people, you know, have decided that that's the rule.     They allow it.     And the Federal Government allows it. So, I'm supposed to impose my -- my judgment on -- on what seems to be a consensus of the American people?       Well, that's not going to help me, you know.       Well, I thought that modern penology has abandoned that rehabilitation thing, and they -- they no longer call prisons reformatories or whatever, and punishment is the -- is the criterion now. Deserved punishment for crime.       Now, if that's the criterion, is everything that you say irrelevant?       Let's assume I don't believe in rehabilitation, as I think sentencing authorities nowadays do not.     Both at the Federal and the State levels, it's been made clear.       What if, instead of striking down the laws in these States, why don't we just require the State legislatures to think about it? All right?     And -- and then see how many think about it, and -- and come up with, you know, something that agrees with you or doesn't agree with you.       Wouldn't that be more democratic somehow?
10-98 +++$+++        Can I ask whether your second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is - is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified immunity?       Once -- once you say that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to the qualified immunity question, and once you say that he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind it as to whether he was abusing it for some other purpose, is there any difference between absolute and qualified immunity?       Well, I thought the -- I thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some of the other functions to which we have given absolute immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute immunity on this particular conduct.     But I don't understand why if we agree with you on qualified immunity, there is any difference whatever.       Right.       Was the prosecution already pending when this -- when this warrant was issued?       I don't see -       I don't see how that would make any difference to the -- at least to the absolute immunity question.     You wouldn't assert that there is absolute immunity if there's a statute such as this, but there is not if there isn't.     I mean, either this is core prosecutorial function for which he can't be sued or it isn't.     So what difference does this statute make as far -- as far as absolute immunity is concerned?       Okay.       So for us to agree with you on absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe that even if there were no such statute and if a prosecutor simply detained somebody as a material witness without any check of a -- of an independent magistrate, he would be immune?       And you can't look behind that, right?     You can't look behind that?     If the -- if the judge has said it's material, that's the end of it; you have absolute immunity, right?       Can appeal the -- the judge's determination that -- that it's material?       Well, then how can you have absolute immunity?       Oh, you mean at the time it's issued?       I see.       Well, what if you didn't have -- again, what if you didn't have this prescribed judicial process?       Well, there are procedures set forth in the statute, I'd say you would add, which you think are not necessary, but are there in order to make them flinch in a different -- in a different -
10-9995 +++$+++        Are there a lot of cases raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in this case?     I mean, if you tell me that's all this case is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it as improvidently granted.       We don't sit here to decide whether when the government says, you know, we do not concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions like that, that come up in a particular case. I thought we took this case to decide the more significant issue, on which there is a division in the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say, power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute of limitations defense has not been raised.     We all agree it wasn't raised.     Now, whether it was forfeited or not is another question.     If that's all you want us to decide, I don't want to decide that.       Ms. Lord, an amicus brief filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil -- the Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be consulted here, because they govern only to the extent that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply and that they -- that they cut against your case.

Ultimately it's our discretion, isn't it?             Well, I assume -- I assume your answer is that it's -- that it's our business, and we don't have to agree with Congress; that we -- we may think $40 a day for the zookeeper and for Albert Einstein is ridiculous.        And, therefore, if it's up to us, we would adopt a different rule.                    Isn't that your answer?               Could you save that for the lower courts?   I mean, you are -- you are trying to distinguish what it can say for the Supreme Court when the Supreme Court is the trial court vis-a-vis what it can say, and has said, for the lower courts.               Why?               You think that, so long as Congress could not create the lower courts at all, once it creates them it can -- it can tie their hands to any sort of absurd rules?               I -- I just don't agree with your assumption that just because Congress need not have created any lower Federal courts, the only Federal court required by the Constitution is this Court, therefore once Congress creates them, it can do whatever it wants with them.       I -- I don't agree with that.               What is magical about original actions?    I mean, what -- what is magical is that we are the only court that is required by the Constitution.    But we are -- we are not just the only court for original actions in -- in -- in all appeals. Can Congress prescribe division of costs and expenses in the appeals that come to us from the lower Federal courts?

And we've said that that just proves that under our system of separated powers, it is none of our business.       Do -- do we parse injury that finely?     I mean, the injury, it seems to me, is being overheard.     Does it -- by the government.     Do we say, oh, well, it's one injury to be overheard under this statute, it's another injury to be overheard under another statute?     Do you know any case where we've -- we've cut the baloney that fine?       Well, the thing is they are going to be injured by being overheard.     And you're saying that they will be overheard anyway, and, therefore, by preventing the government from overhearing them under this statute, we're not redressing their grievance, which is being overheard by the government.       Are there restrictions on giving the information to other government agencies, in particular, the Justice Department?
11-10362 +++$+++        That doesn't prove that they're officers.     I mean, that's -- that's not the test for an officer, how much you're paid.     The test is whether you exercise significant authority under the laws of the United States.    That's a pretty fuzzy line, but I'm not sure that a prison guard exercises significant authority under the laws of the United States.       Well, I will give you -- I'll give you a textual basis.     Why is it if all the statute is concerned about is the status of being a law enforcement -- investigative or law enforcement officer -- why is it that the exception it makes does not eliminate the exemption for libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights? There is excepted from the provisions of the Tort Claims Act any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abusive process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit or interference with contract rights. However, for -- for purposes of this exemption from the exemption -- the exception from the exemption, they leave out the latter part.     Why did they only put in the others?     I think the reason they only put in the others is that those are the kind of torts that would be conducted in the course of conducting a - what's the words -- investigative or law enforcement activity.       The others would not -- would not occur.       Yes, but it's -- it's a limiting factor that -- that shows, that displays an intent to limit the -- the activities of investigative or law enforcement officers to those activities conducted in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.       Why would it leave out those other ones?     That's what I'm asking you.     What possible reason is there to leave out libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights?       I -- I didn't deny that it's the judgment.     What reason could there be for that judgment?       I give you a reason.       The reason -- the reason they left it out is that they don't think those torts would be committed in the course of investigating or enforcing the law.       Mr. Yang, the United States didn't take this position below, right?       This is a change of heart. How long ago was it that the United States took the opposite position, the position argued by amicus here?       So it couldn't be that obvious, I guess?       Can you suggest why Congress might have left out libel, slander, misrepresentation?       Why -- why would they leave that out if they are only looking at the office and not at the function that the person is performing?       Right.     I mean, that's the point.     So what you are saying is that it suggests that they mean Federal law enforcement officers engaged in law enforcement.       You -- you support the government's position on who's an officer, right?     So it wouldn't include EPA.     Is that --       Is that a yes or a no?
11-1059 +++$+++        Mr.     Mann, could -- could I come back to your response to the question of Knox -- the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court can issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is no standing.     That -- I would have thought your answer to that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it on the facts, but that statement was not meant to be exclusive, that that's the only situation in which there -- there is no standing. It was addressing just the third prong of our -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that, where the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the remedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of standing is the court has to be able to provide relief. But there are other elements to standing as well, including whether there is injury, in fact, and whether the injury is -- you know, springs from the action that is challenged.     And those -- those prongs would continue to exist. I didn't think Knox's statement was meant to be all-inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in which standing can be eliminated.       Equity is wonderful.       I'll bet you equity could have considered the husband to have been substituted automatically and could have considered that -- the estate to have been substituted automatically.     That -- that happens when -- when that particular element is -- is eliminated.     But there is nothing automatic about discovering some new plaintiff who -- who is out -- we don't know who is out there.
11-1085 +++$+++        Mr. Waxman, you have a habit of not pausing between sentences.     You pause in the middle of the sentence, and you end a sentence and go right on to the next.     So I apologize for interrupting, but --       -- but you leave me no alternative. (Laughter.)       Yes, I understand.       Is it not the case that one of the other elements necessary for the fraud-on-the-market theory would also be decided conclusively -- for future individual litigants, namely, the efficiency of the market?     A future litigant will ordinarily claim, I either sold it at a depressed price or bought it at an inflated price because of the market's reaction to this particular fraudulent statement.       So -- so you can say the same thing about the efficiency of the -- of the market being determined in this preliminary question, as you can say about -- about the -- the issue here.       Excuse me.       You -- you don't have to prove it to get the class certified.     You only have to prove it to get the class certified with the benefit of the fraud-on-the-market theory.       Which is a shortcut to getting the class certified, right?       So this is just a condition to the shortcut.
11-1118 +++$+++        Ms. Webre, is there any binding effect of a Federal determination here on State law?     And is there any binding effect of any State determination here on Federal law?       If it was left to the State, would what the States say about -- about patent law be binding in any Federal cases?     And, vice-versa, if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything that the Federal court says about -- about State tort law be binding on State courts?       Well, that -- that being so, your -- your last argument about the Federal government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this single case. I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas law in that regard.     They may get this case wrong, but --       What about the Federal issue?     Doesn't that need resolving?       Why -- why do all -- why do all of these issues cut in your favor, in all cases involving malpractice?     I mean, you're urging, not just that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a general rule that malpractice suits involving patent rights can never, ever come under "Federal arising" under jurisdiction. Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to say?       So the burden would be on you to show that every one of these factors, in all of those cases, is always going to cut in your favor. That -- what, that they will never involve a constitutional issue?     That they will never, ever determine future patent decisions?       Well, I like -- I like bright-line rules.     In fact -- you know, I thought Holmes had it right.     It doesn't arise under, unless the cause of action is a Federal cause of action.     But once we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't -- you're -- you're proving a negative. The burden is on you to prove a negative, that there is no situation that can arise in -- in malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal issue would justify arising under jurisdiction.     That's a hard road to hoe.       I guess you might argue that, even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule because the benefits of having a -- a clear rule that doesn't have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the fact that one or two might -- might not come out that way if we applied Grable.       Because we're making it up anyway, right? (Laughter.)       Ms. Webre, can I ask you about the question presented? The way you presented it to us, it -- it was as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the names of those opinions are.     But.     In fact, that's not the situation at all. The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable, and I think just the way you would want it applied.     So your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it correctly; isn't that right?
11-1160 +++$+++        Do you have --       Do you have any cases in which we -- we slice it that fine --       -- that -- that you are a State actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not for others?       I assume -- I assume that the normal corporate charter contains such a provision, the authority to acquire property, right?       And we don't -- that -- that charter is issued by the State, right?       And we don't -- we don't think that that enables all corporations to ignore the Sherman Act, do we?
11-1175 +++$+++        Under -- under that provision, that's certainly true.     You can't -- you can't get costs under that provision unless there has been that prerequisite.     But it's -- you know, it's ancient law that repeals by implication are not favored. And what you're arguing here is that that provision effectively repeals another provision which allows costs in all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior. Now, why -- why is this an exception to our general rule?     I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me like a clear repealer.       We -- we have to assume ignorance of the drafter.       As a general principle.       Isn't it -- isn't it the case that, in order to appeal to the proposition that the specific governs the general, you -- you have to read the second sentence of 3 as containing a negative -- a negative implication?     As saying --       It may not.     So you are reading in a negative -       Suppose -- suppose the words "and costs" were left out in the second sentence? Would not the argument be made that you cannot award costs even in an action brought in bad faith? Wouldn't -- that this sum argument you're making --       But you're saying "negative implication."     If it -- if it says only "attorney's fees in reasonable relation to the work expended," the implication would be you --       -- you cannot -- you cannot, even in the case of a frivolous action, award costs.     Wouldn't that be the reading of it?       Yes, but I'm suggesting if that argument is rejected, so should yours be.       Because it seems the two are parallel.
11-1221 +++$+++        Why did it make an exception then only for divorce decrees?       I mean, there is an express exception in the statute that the beneficiary can be changed by a decree of divorce.       Now, why would Congress say that while at the same time believing that the beneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree of divorce?       But, you know, the -- the exception suggests another thing besides the fact that it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails is by a divorce decree.     It also suggests that Congress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have the sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the insurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to know whom the -- who the beneficiary will be. If that were the case, there wouldn't be this exception for a divorce decree because the insurance company is going to have to look to see if there's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.     That obviously shows that Congress in this statute not only had a concern about efficiency of payment, but also had a concern about who gets the payment, right? There's no other way to explain the -- the exception for divorce decrees.       And you think that's the - that's the purpose of this exception for divorce decrees?       In your experience, a man usually has more children or children in his second marriage than he did in his first?       No, I don't think so, either.     I -- I think if Congress was concerned about money for the kids, it would have left the money with the first wife.       Once again, the divorce exemption blows away that -- that explanation, that all Congress is concerned about is efficient administration of the plan so long as the insurer will know.     You know, just look at the -- look at the -- at the contract, the named beneficiary, pay the money to the named beneficiary, and you're home free.     That -- that is blown away by the exception for divorce decrees.     The insurer is going to have to check that there hasn't been a divorce since the contract was signed, right?       Okay.     They have to check to see if it has been properly filed, right?       I keep -- I keep coming back to the explicit divorce provision, which says when there's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it, without a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new wife, okay.     And you're telling us that even without a divorce decree, the new wife will effectively get the money so long as there is a State law that says all - all proceeds from insurance companies for policies entered into before the -- before the -- the decedent was divorced will go to the new wife. It seems to me that is such a -- such a blatant frustration of the -- not just the purpose of - of the very text of the divorce provision in the law, which says only if there is a decree properly filed will it go to the new wife.     And you're saying, well, it doesn't really matter so long as there's a State law which says it will go to the new wife without a -- you know.       Why don't they just say, look, if the -- if the State law says so, the -- the new wife gets it?     Why didn't they just say that instead of -- you're telling me they set up this -- this sick system in which the -- the former wife or the new wife has to sue the former wife to get the money that was paid to the former wife.     I mean, my goodness.     What - our courts are crowded with -- with suits between, you know -- why -- why don't they just say, if the State law says it, it goes to the new wife.
11-1231 +++$+++        Mr. Kneedler, you -- what I find incompatible in your argument is you -- you assert that this is a jurisdictional limitation.       Can you think of any other instance in which we have found something to be a jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or agency, subject to that limitation, to extend it?     I -- I had always thought that once you say it's jurisdictional, it means you have to abide by it.       Well, if there is another statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory extension is part of the jurisdictional limitation. That's fine. But when you just have a jurisdictional 180 days, without any statutory provision for extension, if it's jurisdictional, I thought that's the end of the game.       Undoubtedly.     But have any jurisdictional time limitations?       The problem with taking that approach, of course -- and I assume why you assert that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long history of both the board and the Secretary regarding this as jurisdictional.       They have said it.
11-1274 +++$+++        Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you acknowledge that a civil action could be brought beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff discovers the fraud, right?       So you're really not arguing for what you might call a total statute of repose.     It seems to me odd that the defendant would be relieved from prosecution by the government, but not relieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial damages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have to sue until he's discovered the fraud.       Sure.     But that 5 years doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff discovers the fraud, right?       No?
11-1285 +++$+++        I didn't think we took this case to review the plan.     Is -- is that what the Supreme Court took the case for, to say what this particular individual plan said?       Had that -- had that point been raised, we would not have taken the case.       I'm sorry.     Maybe --       Excuse me, please.     The second point?       Counsel, I guess your opponent could have raised that point.       And didn't raise it.       And we took this case on the assumption that there is an issue of law involved --       -- and not -- not on the assumption that --       You say, "they."     I assume you mean their lawyer?       This is not -- you know, an ignorant layman who knows nothing about the law.       The lawyer, you say, did not ask for the plan.       That's -- that's not unusual.     The motto is equity follows the law. Doesn't -- doesn't that usually -- isn't that usually the case?       Where there is a legal right, equity cannot overcome it.
11-1327 +++$+++        Because, I suppose, the judge is the government, too.       So whether the unfairness adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's been treated unfairly.       Counsel often encourage judges to do the wrong thing.     In fact, in every case, there is one of the two counsel urging the court to do the wrong thing; right?       That's what the adversary system consists of.
11-1347 +++$+++        And the Alabama court would not have jurisdiction if the child had been wrongfully removed?       Is that what you're saying?       Wait, wait, wait.     The opinion below has been vacated.       So there's -- there's nothing which says that this child -- this child's habitual residence was -- was in the U.K.       That being the case, the only question is will the Alabama court proceed, even -- assuming that it finds the child's habitual residence was in Alabama, would it proceed, even if the child had been taken out of the jurisdiction?     And I understand that it would.       There hasn't been.     There hasn't been.     It's been vacated.     It's as though it never happened.       Well, that's bad law.     I mean -- you mean the Alabama court is bound by a vacated decision of a Federal court?     My goodness, I never heard of anything like that.       I don't understand your answer.       What is your -- I don't understand that answer.     Are you -- are you saying that -- that your failure to appeal that in a timely fashion makes it impossible for the Court of Appeals to obliterate that award?       Well, that's -- that's what I thought the question was.       Well, then -- then retain your tunnel vision.     And don't say that the case remains non-moot simply because of this other issue.     The other issue is either in the case or out of the case.     Now, is it part of your case?       Well, I mean, that's lovely, but -- so you are saying that you don't have to appeal that separately; is that what you're saying?       But you've got to answer my question.       Do you have to appeal that separately or not?     If -- if the way you answered Justice Alito's question was -- was the way you did, you are saying that it's unnecessary to appeal that monetary aspect of the judgment separately, that it goes -- it goes with the rest of it.     Is that -- is that your position?       I think you're saying it doesn't have to be appealed separately.       But you could bring a Hague proceeding there, right?       You could say -- you know, there having been no decision in the United States, we want you to decide what habitual residence is, and we think it's the United States.     You could do that.       But we don't know it'll make a difference without answering those questions.       I mean, you want us to -- to say it might make a difference, and that's enough, right?       Well, you should put it that way, then.     It doesn't -- you don't know that it makes a difference, but you don't have to know, right?       Well, that's lovely, but there wasn't a stay here.     So what do you do when that procedure hasn't been followed?     That's the issue that we're presented with.       And do we even know that a stay would have been appropriate here?       So presumably, a stay would not have been appropriate.       Counsel, that's very nice.     What does that have to do with this case?     I don't understand that.       Well, the burden is different, but I don't agree that the standard changes. It's just who has to prove it, one side or the other. But I --
11-1351 +++$+++        But why -- why would Congress want to treat them differently?       But why -- why did they feel the need here to assure adequate remedies for tort victims, where they did not in -- in the Westfall Act?       I mean -- you know, injured tort victims are injured tort victims.     It does seem -- you know, rather odd that, in -- in one instance, Congress would be concerned and, the other, not concerned.       Of course, when the government removes the case, it concedes that point, doesn't it, normally?     Where a case is removed from State court, the government -- the Attorney General must certify that it was within the scope of employment, no?       What was that case, where no action against the United States is available?       Not -- not by reason of the -- of the battery?       I understand.       Yes, yes.       I see.       I got you.       It -- it --       It's right on the same thing, so I -- that provision ends -- and I am strengthening you -- your last point -- that provision ends, "if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against the United States described in Section 1346(b) of Title 28." That clearly envisions that, in the ordinary case, those remedies against the United States would not be precluded.
11-139 +++$+++        Yes, but once -- once we resolve an ambiguity in a statute, that's the law, and the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes the law just because, going in, the language was ambiguous.       Yes, but our job is not to plumb Congress's psyche and decide what they had in mind.     It's to interpret the statute.     And if, as you acknowledge, it's a pretty obscure way to change the law from what we said it was, the law that's written there, that's a very obscure way to change it.     I'm inclined to think that the law stays the way it was.       So, this language would have one meaning if the very same language were adopted after our decision in -- in Colony and a different meaning if it were adopted, as it was, before our decision in Colony.       That's a very strange approach to a -- to the meaning of a statute, it seems to me.       Well, by far?     By a little maybe, and I might agree with that, but -- but we're not writing on a blank slate here.       Indeed, I think Colony may well have been wrong, but there it is.     It's -- it's the law, and it said that that language meant a certain thing.     And the issue is whether this is -- this change is enough to change the meaning of the statute.     And -- and I'm dubious about that.       If --
11-1425 +++$+++        Why don't you force him to take the breathalyzer test, instead of forcing him to have a needle shoved in his -- in his arm?       What -- what is the difference between the reliability or the acceptability by juries of a breathalyzer test, as opposed to a blood draw?       Of course we don't know why they disapproved.     And I guess your point is they may well not have permitted it because they were under what you would call the mistaken belief that it was unconstitutional.       Mr. Koester, in most jurisdictions, unless I'm mistaken, the cop on the beat cannot apply for and get a search warrant.     He has to go through a prosecuting attorney or someone in the prosecutor's office first.     So it's not just getting hold of a judge.     It's getting hold of the prosecutor first and then getting hold of the judge if the prosecutor approves it, right?       Is that the case in Missouri?       But -- I mean, once we say that you don't need a warrant -- you know, even if things improve, the game's up, right?     No?       You mean somebody can come up 10 years from now and say, although you approved it years ago without a warrant, things have changed, so now you need a warrant?       But if that's the case, then why shouldn't that determination be made case by case?       Case by case, whether in fact it would have taken that long to get a warrant? And if it -- if it would have taken too long, then it's okay without a warrant.     If it wouldn't have taken that long, it's bad.       Totality of the circumstances test, right?       That doesn't mean that it was enough, either, right?       Counsel for Missouri tells us, Ms. Saharsky, that the breathalyzer is just as good and that in fact he expects that the consequence of our ruling in his favor in this case will be that drunken drivers will agree to the breathalyzer test. But I don't know why it isn't adequate to produce that result simply to put the drunken driver in a -- in a paddy wagon and on the way to the hospital say -- you know, we're going to be in the hospital in minutes; we're applying for a warrant; when we get there, we're going to -- we're going to -- you know, stick a needle in your arm, unless, of course, you agree to take the breathalyzer test.     Why isn't that enough to -- to force them into the breathalyzer test, so that they will blow up the balloon.
11-1447 +++$+++        For what?     For what?     You wouldn't -- you wouldn't know what property was taken.       You are -- you are posing a situation in which he never came forward with any suggestion.     They never came forward with any suggestion.     You say he still has a cause of action for a taking?       A taking of what?       I think the other side says that you may have such a cause of action here.       Wouldn't -- wouldn't the other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here?       But they are just saying you don't have a cause of action for a taking.       Yes, that's fine.     That -- that would enable you to challenge the denial of the permit, saying it's based upon an unconstitutional condition.     But how does it -- how does it enable you to say there's been a taking?     What has been taken?       It hasn't -- it hasn't been taken.     I mean, he turned it down.       The -- the permit was granted in Nollan and Dolan.     And -- and the condition attached to the permit, therefore, took effect; namely, that you had to dedicate this easement over your -- over your beach, whereas, as my colleague pointed out, anybody could walk back and forth, barefooted. (Laughter.)       Sliced bread's supposed to       No, it -- it would be subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis if they took the $10,000.     If they issued the permit, the developer went ahead with the development, and the State then attached the -- the bank account in the amount of $10,000 or whatever, that would be Nollan -- in Nollan and Dolan -- in Nollan, there was a taking. He had gone ahead with the -- with the development of his house under the permit, which said, if he did that, he gave away the easement.     So there -- there was a -- a taking there.     The -- the easement would have been taken automatically. In -- in -- in Dolan, there was -- the individual had not gone ahead with the development, but it was clear that any development the person undertook would be subject to the -- the exaction that the municipality required.     So there was a -- a taking there, we said. Here, there's nothing that happens.     The permit was denied, unlike in -- unlike in -- in Dolan, where the permit was granted, and it was understood that, if she went ahead with it, she was going to lose -- lose some land rights.     Here, the permit's been denied.     I can't see where there's a taking here. Nothing's been taken.       The permit had issued.     The permit had issued in both of those cases, and, therefore, the person was saying, to go ahead with this permit, I give up -- I give up this land.       There was no approval with conditions.     There's one thing for -- for a municipality to issue an -- an approval with conditions, and a municipality saying, we can't approval it unless you agree to these conditions.     And the person doesn't agree, and the municipality says, we don't approve it.
11-1450 +++$+++        Yes, but under the traditional -- you surely don't want us to apply the rules of the traditional diversity statute to this case because it's clear that under the traditional diversity statute, you -- you can waive excessive damages, right?       So you don't want us to apply that rule here.
11-1518 +++$+++        A quarter of a million dollars in loans.       And that did not go back into the trust.       As it should.     Doesn't the trustee have to disgorge whatever he makes by improper use of the trust funds?
11-1545 +++$+++        Well, don't, because I don't -- I don't think it's so clear. (Laughter.)       Look, what you've told us is jurisdiction means a lot of things, but what you mean by it is real jurisdiction, right?       Chevron Step Zero jurisdiction.     That doesn't clarify things very much for me.     What if -- what if the statute in this case said, the FCC shall have no jurisdiction to establish time limits within which the States must act?       Okay?     Would that be a jurisdictional question?       Okay.     What if the statute just said, the FCC shall not establish time limits within which the States must act.     Is that jurisdictional?       I -- I don't think so.     In fact, I think we have said in -- in a number of opinions -- and, certainly, I have said in a concurrence -- that the jurisdictional question, like any other question -- an alleged jurisdictional question, like any other one, is to be decided with deference to the agency. Now, if you -- if you talk -- if you want to limit your proposal --       -- to the -- to the entry question --       -- of whether the FCC has jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications Act, I agree with you.     I will decide that without listening to the FCC.     But that's -- that's a good deal short of whether, given that it does have jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications Act, its implementation of this particular provision goes beyond what its authority is. That seems, to me, a question of -- you can call everything that's ultra vires in excess of the agency's jurisdiction, you can.     But that's not -- that's not what we mean by the entry jurisdictional question, does the agency have authority to administer this Act.       That's -- that's no different from our holding in any case that the agency has no authority to issue this rule.     It has rule-making authority, but this rule goes too far, which is to say Congress did not give the agency authority to go this far.       It's -- it's always a question of how much authority Congress gave the agency.       Did -- did it say, in all of those cases, we give no deference to the agency's contrary determination because this is a jurisdictional question?     Did it say anything like that?       I didn't think so.       Very -- very often, I could decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running away from the question of deference vel non because things have been so confused by Meade.     So they simply decide the question assuming no deference to the agency. That doesn't prove that, in that particular case, the agency wouldn't have been entitled to deference.       Whether it was or not, it would have come out this way.     So those three cases don't -- don't prove what you say they prove.       Before you get to that, I'm really surprised at your response to Justice Kennedy, that you agree that, even where the agency has no jurisdiction, although you won't give Chevron deference, you will give whatever the other kind of deference.       Why would you give Skidmore deference, if some non-jurisdictional agency comes in and says, hey, by the way, court -- you know, I think this is the right answer?     Oh, we will listen to that respectfully.     We won't necessarily give you Chevron -- why would you give it any deference at all, if there is no jurisdiction?       And that's all you think that Skidmore deference means?     You will listen to opinions that make sense, right?       But just to agency opinions, it makes sense, not to --       Suppose I didn't know that, and I'm just looking at the text, okay?       There are innumerable statutes which, after giving of the agency rule-making authority, provide judicial -- you know, review under this statute shall be held in such-and-such a court. There is no conflict whatever between a statement that any person affected can sue in Federal court and the possession by an agency of rule-making authority.     The -- the two simply don't conflict.
11-159 +++$+++        I'm sorry.     Go ahead.       My impression is that, I'm not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision, a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the father.       Well, you rely only on that -- on that definition. The section is entitled "Old-age and survivors insurance benefit payments," and it also provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et cetera. It seems to me -- is the word "survivor" used anywhere in the text of this statute except in the -- in the heading of this section?       We use titles to determine the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?       Nor would -- nor would he meet the requirements of (C), would he?     Would he meet any of the requirements of (C)?     Of (d)(1)(C).       Then what does -- what does (d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --       Well, it doesns say  it says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that requirement.     If such -- such child, the one defined in (e).       Could you -- go ahead and finish.       Counsel, I now have in front of me (h)(3).     I don't see how it has anything to do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C). Why do you think it has something to do with that?       Well, unless such individual was not living with or contributing to the support of such child -- which is certainly the case here; the child had not yet been born -- and other qualifications.     The principal condition does not exist. Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting father unless at such time such individual, mother or father or adopted father was not living with or contributing to the support of such child.     How does that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)?       Well, that may well be.       If that is ambiguous, why doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it (h)(3) or whatever the 3 we're -- we've been playing with here -- despite (d)(3), despite that, it seems to me that they don't meet that requirement.
11-161 +++$+++        If -- if you win, does - does the city just have to give you enough to bring it down to 5 to 1 so that it's no longer a gross disparity?       I think -- I think that Justice Breyer is suggesting that if you treat unconstitutionally a whole lot of people, you can get away with it. (Laughter.)       You wouldn't have any incentive to bring a lawsuit if that were the remedy, would you?       So, effectively -       Have we ever decided an equal protection case on the basis that the -- the State who had violated the -- the Constitution can't afford to pay for it?     Is there any case that supports that?       It's just too expensive?       And, therefore, we have to deny equal protection?       You don't believe in the administrative nightmare exception to the Equal Protection Clause? (Laughter.)
11-166 +++$+++        Could the -- could the judge say, when the proposal is made to him, the only way I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent is to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is what we always do?     Can the judge say that?       Now, you're, you're --       Mr. -- Mr. Neff, can -- are you done?     I'm sorry.     I didn't want to stop your answer.       Can I -- let's look at the text.     Little (ii) provides for exactly what you want to do here.     What you want to do under (iii) is precisely what (ii) says, except you want to eliminate, subject to Section 363(k) of this title, right? Does it -- does it make much sense for a provision to say you can do it three ways:     number (i); number (ii), you can have this sale subject to credit bidding; and number (iii), after -- after saying that, specifically, oh, you can have this sale, not subject to credit bidding? That's -- that's not a very sensible statute.     Why -- why go through that -- that problem of -- of saying number (ii), if you could have left it to number (iii) anyway?       Yes.       Mr. Neff, don't you feel sorry for the United States?     The United States is often in the creditor situation, and the United States cannot come up with cash. Are they going to run to Congress and get an appropriation for each -- each security case it has? What -- what do you propose we do with the United States?     The United States just can't take any security interests anymore or what?       I -- I don't understand.       But wouldn't the court always say, when -- when it's confronted with this situation, the government comes in, and the court says, yes, well, you know, I -- I guess that that price is probably so low because nobody could credit bid.     I mean, wouldn't that always be a -- a frailty of whatever -- whatever price it sold for?     Wouldn't it always be?       Well, that might be, but -- you know, it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher bids than -- than if you allow them to bid for cash only.      That just means that you can't find a buyer who is willing to pay that much.       I didn't realize the judge had to approve -       Yes.       The judge has to approve the stalking horse?       I -- say it again?     I didn't -- I didn't understand that.       What you just said is, so long as they come in with some appraisals that are above what -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's not the indubitable equivalent?       Because you've got to have at least one appraiser who says it's -- it's worth more. Is that all it takes?       Indubitable is indubitable.       If you have one honest appraiser who says --       What -- what happens if you go to the judge and the judge says, there is one higher bid, so I can't say it's indubitable?     Then what happens?
11-182 +++$+++        Anyway, if this is a problem, is it -- is it an immigration law problem?       Or is it a Fourth Amendment problem?       Is the Government's attack on this that it violates the Fourth Amendment?       So, you'll concede that the -- that the state has to accept within its borders all people who have no right to be there, that the Federal government has no interest in removing?       That's -- that's all the statute -- and you call up the Federal government, and the Federal government -- yes, he's an illegal immigrant, but that's okay with us.       And -- and the state has no power to -- to close its -- its borders to -- to people who have no right to be there?
11-184 +++$+++        -- you started to say that the Civil Service Reform Act made some fundamental change?       Yes.       Suppose -- suppose the Civil Service Reform Act had said nothing at all about -- about suits under the Civil Rights Act, under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act and so forth.     What would the situation be?     Wouldn't you have a right to go to district court?       So, to prevent you from going to district court under those statutes, you have to find a repealer contained somewhere -       -- in the Civil Service Reform Act, correct?       Why isn't that a repealer of what would otherwise be the law under all these civil rights statutes?     Why isn't that a repealer of what would otherwise be their right to go to district court? You are saying, no, you can't go to district court because of these time limits, not even established by statute, but, for Pete's sake, established by regulation.     You think that that's -- that's an effective repealer of the right to go to district court?       He was just keeping score. (Laughter.)       Checking them off.
11-192 +++$+++        I assume youre appealing to the textual principle that the specific governs the general.     Isn't that what's going on here?       That the Tucker Act is a more general provision, and you are saying it's -- it's overcome by a more specific provision that provides for compensation, but excludes the Federal Government.       Excuse me.     1681b(b)(b), you said?     Where is that case?       You said 7a.       Right.       Still in all, your argument is -- is not just a straightforward specific governs the general argument.     I mean, that would be the case if -- if the other statute which the plaintiff is trying to run around through the Tucker Act specifically -- it clearly prohibits suit against the Government.     Then you would say, you know, the specific governs the general even though the govern -- the Tucker Act permits it; this statute prohibits it. But you're saying this other statute here does not really prohibit it.     You're just saying this other statute does not permit it under our usual rules about waiver of sovereign immunity being strictly construed.     So, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a difference -- it's an odd sort of a specific governs the general argument.       No, but that's -- that's because the negative implication of that statute is -- affirms that there is no liability of the United States. Okay?     But here, you don't have -- you don't have that negative implication at all, do you?       Isn't it really -- doesn't the question come down to as you're putting it whether -- whether the Tucker Act eliminates for all other statutes the presumption against liability on the part of the United States?  lose, not win.        So what is covered by the Tucker Act?     I mean, every -- every basis for suit against the Government, every claim that the Government owes you money rests upon some statutory text, doesn't it?       So what --       Okay.     Express contracts with the United States.     Anything else?       Okay.     But anything that comes under a statute, you would look to the other statute to see whether there is sovereign immunity under that statute; and, if there is under that statute, then the Tucker Act does not overcome it.       Say it again.     I lost it. Give me the last sentence again.       Mr. Srinivasan, I hate to eat up any of your time, but do you acknowledge that there are other statutes under which a person can proceed, either under the statute or under the Tucker Act?       What about the Privacy Act?       So -- so you'd say you either proceed under the Privacy Act and you're covered there, or you don't --       And what about -- what is it?     FSLA was the other one?       What about (u)(l), that your friend raised?
11-199 +++$+++        Are you -- are you saying that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been the same by this jury if the error had not been made? You're --       You're saying that the test is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did, it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have been pronounced absent that evidence?       Well, then, what is harmless error?     Every error is harmful.     Every error that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict. There's no such thing as harmless error.       What -- what does that mean?     To say that it doesn't substantially impact the verdict means the verdict would have been the same despite this evidence.     But you're saying, no, that's not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to the verdict.     The Government says, well, it did, but the verdict would have been the same anyway. That's what harmless error is, it seems to me.
11-204 +++$+++        Excuse me.     I -- I don't agree that there's an agreement for transfer of title. Where there's a consignment, you give the property to somebody, and he says I will sell it to somebody if somebody will buy it.       There is no agreement to transfer title.       It's purely a future contingency.     If someone will buy it, I will sell them -- sell it to that person on your account.       I don't -- I don't understand what that is.       What's an emergency service worker?       Excuse me.     They're not on duty all the time.     Aren't -- don't they have hours of duty?     My goodness.     Some of them make enormous overtime wages because they've put in hours beyond their regular hours of duty --       These people have no hours of duty.       Congress can draw -- draw even silly lines.       One of my law clerks is familiar with the -- the framing business.     Okay?     Now, salesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time that they visit the -- the framing company or the framing store.     They get a commitment that in the future, that person will order from the framing company. Now, is that a sale?       Well, but there is a commitment.     There is a commitment to -- what they're trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the future.     That's a commitment.       It's a peculiar line of commerce.     And -- and you're saying that what constitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where you're selling to people who cannot make a commitment.       Well, excuse me. Consignment salesmen are -- are not exempt?       Excuse me.     How can they put in number (2)?     I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k). Can -- can they supplement 3(k)?       What's the authority to do that?       Well, that's wonderful. Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the question before us is whether it's arbitrary or capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these people look like salesmen to me. And so, if they can do number (2) there, I don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and by the way, detailers are also included.       And the issue would be whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.       Sure there is; sure there is.     But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really have a different -- a different argument before us here.       Did we have detailers in 1940?     Gee, that's a long time ago.     Did we have detailers in 1940?     That's almost a century ago.       But this is part of a regular program that the agency has now instituted, to run around the country and file amicus briefs; is that it?       Yes, right, to get -- instead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing adjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the court will accept our view in that amicus brief and, hey, presto, we have -- we have made law.       That's extraordinary.       There are 90,000 of these people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought any action for these -- lo, these many years.     Ninety thousand of them.     And all of a sudden, you say -- you come in and say, oh, you have been in violation of the law in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot of money for all these people that you didn't give overtime to in the past. I just think that's extraordinary.       So, you have been guilty of malfeasance for 70 years, right?     These 90,000 people out there who have been in violation of the law and the agency has done not a blessed thing?       You don't suggest -- you're not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty?     Is that --       Well, which is it?     I mean, you say, yes, yes, it's both.       Pick one.       Is it the transfer of title or a commitment?       Ah.     Okay.       It's a finding of logic, for Pete's sake.     These are prescriptions.     You can only get a prescription from a doctor.     Obviously, the number of prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of prescriptions given by doctors.       That's a different point.       It's not the point you were making.
11-210 +++$+++        Why is it much harder to define?     I don't -- why does the broadness have anything to do with the breathing space?     I mean, I suppose your argument here is that there is harm; it's not just falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just as libel is.       Okay.     So -- and in the example that Justice Ginsburg just gave -- in your case there's harm to those courageous men and women who receive the decorations.     In the -- in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, there's harm to the people who honorably served in the armed forces.       Well, why isn't that just as -       Their service is demeaned when everybody says I served in the armed forces.       I don't see any difference as far as that risk goes.     I hope that in your earlier colloquy with Justice Kennedy, you -- you were not retreating from what our cases have repeatedly said, that there is no First Amendment value in falsehood.       Now, this doesn't mean that every falsehood can be punished, because in -- in punishing some falsehoods you -- you risk deterring - deterring truth.       I believe that there's no First Amendment value in -- in falsehood.       I suppose that even in the commercial context we allow a decent amount of lying, don't we?     It's called "puffing."       Although -- although, you know, making false representations to sell a product is -- is unlawful, we do allow puffing, don't we?       You won't buy it cheaper anywhere else, and -       So, maybe we allow a certain amount of puffing in political speech as well.       Nobody believes all that stuff, right? (Laughter.)       Did the Commander in Chief sign that -- that legislation?
11-246 +++$+++        Mr. Miller, you -- you claim on behalf of the government that the decision of whether to take the land into trust has nothing to do with the use to which the land will be put; wherefore, these plaintiffs who were complaining about the use to which it'll be put have no standing. If that is so, why did the government delay the taking into trust for 3 years while there was pending a lawsuit which would have prevented the use that the government intended the newly trusted land to be used for? You delayed for 3 years because there was a challenge to whether you could use -- whether this land could be used for what you call gaming and I call gambling. Why did you delay for 3 years if it's irrelevant?       Well, wait.     On what basis? On any basis other than --       Well, what environmental action consequences are there from the mere decision to take it into trust?     Unless you know what it's going to be used for, you have no idea what the environmental consequences are.       But the challenge was to -- was to the transfer, you say.       Based in part on the use to which it was going to be put; right?       Why not?     Of course, it doesn't have to be within the interest, it just has to be arguably within the interest.     That -- that adverb is left out in much of the discussion. But if, indeed, the use of the land is one of the elements to be considered in taking title, why isn't somebody who is affected by the proposed use within the zone of interest?       You could put that it way, or you could put it that the injury comes from the government's taking title for gaming.     Okay?     You could put it that way as well.       Inasmuch as the government always has a purpose in mind when it takes title.       But the Act provides for that.     The Act provides for that, right?       Well, is -- is that in the -- is that in the Administrative Procedure Act?     I thought the Administrative Procedure Act eliminates the -- the old bugaboo of sovereign immunity, and says when it -- when it will stand and when it won't.       And if you're relying on the Quiet Title Act, that -- that clearly covers only suits which seek to say, I own the land rather than the government, and this is not such a suit.     So I don't see why the normal APA principles wouldn't govern.       No, but the relief to be sought under the Quiet Title Act is title in the plaintiff.     That's the relief ultimately sought.       Now, on the way to that, you may -- you may get some injunctive remedy, but the basis for the lawsuit is -- is not:     I own the land.       Relief in that kind of suit, yes.       Relief in that kind of suit. But this is not that kind of suit.       Excuse me.     I guess I've lost you.       Okay.       You can say that again and again, counsel, but it does say "under this section." And I don't -- I don't know how you get out from under that.     It says "under this section."       And if this section applies only to suits seeking to assert title on the part of a plaintiff, it's not under this section.       I thought you were going to answer how his -- his complaint constructively changed.       I thought you were going to tell us how it constructively changed to be an action seeking to have a decree that title was in him, which is what the QTA covers.       Okay.       So even constructively, it hasn't turned into that.       All right.     Do you have any concern that the government will get hoist by its own petard? What your argument -- the conclusion to which your argument leads is that this individual, or any individual claiming that the government took title incorrectly, can sue under the Quiet Title Act, even if they don't claim that title was taken from them. Are you sure that's good for the government?       Of course, that's not the only time the government takes land, right?
11-262 +++$+++        Do they have to give -- at least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the officer stopped the car.       There was a broken taillight.     There existed probable cause, whether that was the basis on which he acted or not.     Now -- is it any different when --       With respect to an arrest?       So long as they have good reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter.       Is it different?     You -- you acknowledge that prosecutors always prosecute, that they never exercise discretion and say, oh, what the heck, you know?       All the time.     All the time.     I don't know that it's any less frequent than -- than an officer deciding not to arrest.       Why is there any difference if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized demonstration --       -- in front of this Court or anywhere for that matter?     The people making the demonstration have -- have the same motivation and can make the same assertion of, oh, the only reason you arrested me was because you didn't like what I was -- what I was talking about.     So, why should that situation be different?       What -- what about for crowd control?     You want to extend it to crowd control as well.     What difference does the First Amendment make there?
11-338 +++$+++        That's usually the objective.       What if -- what if the rule is held invalid?     I mean, we don't know the answer to that question until this rule is challenged, and there is ultimately a -- I'm sure it will be challenged because their position is that the -- this rule contradicts the statute.     So how does that factor in to your analysis?       I understand that, but my point is, until that suit is -- is concluded, you don't know whether there is a possibility of future violation or not, do you?
11-345 +++$+++        We've had cases involving alleged discrimination in state -- state contracting. And we haven't required the person who was discriminated against because of race to prove that he would have gotten the contract otherwise, have we?       It's -- it's been enough that there was a denial of equal protection.       Her claim is not necessarily that she would have been -- would have been admitted, but that she was denied a fair chance in the admission lottery.     Just as when a person is denied participation in the contracting lottery, he has suffered an injury.       Was it -- was it done before or after they announced the decision to reinstitute racial --       Which came almost immediately after our decision in Grutter.       And by the way, do you think that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's question -- do you think that Grutter held that there is no more affirmative action in higher education after 2028?       Was that the holding of Grutter?       That's a scary -- that's a scary --       There are facts, and there are facts, aren't there?       That -- that's a normal fact that we accede to two-court holdings on, whether there is -- is or is not a critical mass?       It's a weird kind of a fact.       It's an estimation, isn't it?     A judgment?       Why -- why don't you seriously suggest that?     Why don't you seriously suggest that demographic -- that the demographic makeup of the state has nothing to do with whether somebody feels isolated, that if you're in a state that is only 1 percent black that doesn't mean that you're not isolated, so long as there's 1 percent in the class?       I wish you would take that position because it seems, to me, right.       Excuse me.     The 10 percent plan is not imposed by the University.     It's not their option --       -- to say this -- this is not good for education because people will take easy courses.     It's imposed by state law, isn't it?       Anybody who is in the top percent of any school in the state gets into the University of Texas.
11-393 +++$+++        There's such a thing as legislative inertia, isn't there?       I mean --       Yes, I wanted to ask you about that.     Why do we look to the -- are you sure we look to the intent of the Congress?     I thought that, you know, sometimes Congress says that these provisions will -- all the provisions of this Act will be severable, and we ignore that when the Act really won't work, when the remaining provisions just won't work.     Now, how can you square that reality with the proposition that what we're looking for here is what would this Congress have wanted?       Yes, they sure do.       That's true, but is it right?       When we strike that down, it's clear that Congress would not have passed it without that.     It was -- it was the means of getting the last necessary vote in the Senate.     And you're telling us that the whole statute would fall because the Cornhusker kickback is bad.     That can't be right.
11-45 +++$+++        In -- in those cases, did the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit?       Yes, well, that's -- that's the problem here.     I mean, yes, if all you have is a constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose would work.     You go to the district court.     But where -- where you have both, it's a problem.       Well, and whether that reason was justifiable.     And isn't it the case that whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you would have an as-applied challenge, right?       So, why do you need a facial challenge in addition?     I thought that we always try to do as-applied first and facial second.     So, why isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying that this action was wrong and not allowed under the statute?     And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the problem?       And why is that wrong?     It seems to me that's what the -- what the Administrative Procedure Act says, that if there is no other effective means of judicial review, you get judicial review under the APA.       These people have no effective right because they can't go to the MSPB and can't go to the Federal Circuit.     So, they have -- they have rights in the district court.     That's not a problem. The problem is the people who do have rights to go to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, who have constitutional claims based on -- on the unconstitutionality of a statute?       Why?       Yes, but that's -- that's entirely logical.     Fausto in effect said that the statutory structure simply provides no cause of action for these people, okay?       They're not entitled to anything.     But I don't think that there's anything in the -- in the civil service laws that say these people are not entitled to constitutional protections.     So, I don't think that -- that Fausto rules this out.       Exactly.       And it's those that I say that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board -- they can bring those constitutional claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims.       Yes.     You're taking -- I'm saying that's true only with respect to those people who have no right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.     You're going further.       And you're saying even the people who can appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, right, can go directly to the district court? That's a different question.
11-460 +++$+++        Mr. Coates, I am -- I am still perplexed.       You say -- and it seems to be correct, that each -- each alleged polluter is only responsible for his own pollution.     But you also say that these monitors are so situated that it is impossible to tell from the monitor who is responsible for the pollution; is that right?       So whose fault is that?       What -- what it is -- what is it that provides for that?       Is -- is your description of the statute meant to conclude, or does it -- does it conclude, that these outsource monitoring stations which exist under the new permit are not really required?       Oh, I understood that. Yes.       Can you put in the permit stuff that the statute does not require?       Okay.       Did we use our usual language, and did it go back, and the -- and the court of appeals considered --       -- considered the issue we had refused to consider?       Okay.       Don't we have two -- I don't know that we do this all the time.     When we expect them to keep the case and do something different, don't we usually vacate and remand, rather than reverse?       But they might change their mind now.     They might change their mind.
11-465 +++$+++        Well, I assume that in -- in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was enough indication that the court did not consider it or not, right?     And every year is a reduction of sentence, so to speak.       There would be a lot of good debate over whether it was presented clearly enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to require the court to answer it.     I can see a whole -- you know, a whole train of litigation on this wonderful subject, a whole new area of law.     Has the -- has the State supreme court overlooked something that was clearly enough presented, and is there enough indication that the State court has overlooked it?     I mean -- that's the problem.       Doesn't the -- doesn't the word denied at the end of the order say the same thing? We've considered --       -- all of the points made, and we have denied them. And wouldn't it be the case that if you require such a statement, but you have a situation where a Federal question occupies 90 percent of the brief, and the court only addresses explicitly the state things, the state claims, and then at the very end says, we have considered all the other claims, presumably including the 90 percent Federal claims that are not addressed, would we be out of the woods, or would you be here again arguing the same problem?
11-551 +++$+++        Didn't we have similar language in Cherokee Nation?     Didn't we say that that language in Cherokee Nation, which was in the general appropriations statute, although not     in each contract, didn't mean that the Secretary could refuse to pay?       No, I don't mean the Appropriations Act.     I mean -- I mean the general statute that governed this program.       So why does it mean one thing there and mean something else when -- in the Appropriations Act?       No, but -- but there wasn't in Ferris either.     I mean, that was the problem.     If the appropriations had been enough to cover that plus the later expenditures, there would have been no problem.       Lawfully available subject to appropriations.     I mean, it was subject to appropriations.       That's not really relevant here anyway, is it?       What I don't understand is why the language "not to exceed" is any different from Congress appropriating $900,000.     You mean the world changes if -- if Congress, instead of just appropriating $900,000, authorizes the Secretary to expend not to exceed $900,000?     Why --       Well, I -- I would think $900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you appropriate.
11-556 +++$+++        Hard rock instead of -- (Laughter.)       Excuse me.     Why -- why -- why no more?     Why just Skidmore?       That's an absolute rule?
11-564 +++$+++        Well, that's right. And there's such a thing as what is called the curtilage of a house. As I understand the law, the police are entitled to use binoculars to look into the house if -- if the residents leave the blinds open, right?       But if they can't see clearly enough from a distance, they're not entitled to go onto the curtilage of the house, inside the gate, and use the binoculars from that vantage point, are they?       Why isn't it the same thing with the dog?     This dog was brought right up -- right up to the -- to the door of the house.       Well, then we've taken an unrealistic case, if that has been conceded, because it seems to me crucial that this officer went onto the portion of the house that -- as to which there is privacy, and -- and used a means of -- of discerning what was in the house that -- that should not have been available --       -- in that space.       Police officers can come there to knock on the door, but I thought you've conceded that police officers can't come there to look into the house with binoculars, right?       When the purpose of the officer's going there is to -- is to conduct a search, it's not permitted.       It isn't just the sniffing in the abstract.     It's the sniffing at this point, the sniffing at a person's front door, right?     I mean --       Well, I didn't say it wouldn't be a search if the police officer himself did that if he went there with the intention of -- of smelling at the door.     He's going there to search, and he shouldn't be on the curtilage to search.
11-5683 +++$+++        Excuse me.     Is a fair implication enough?     You're talking here about a repeal, essentially, of an earlier provision, section 109.     And our cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear implication, unquestionable implication. Do you think this is really clear and unquestionable?       I'm really troubled by "fair implication" -       How many -- how many cases do you have that say "fair implication" as opposed to quite a few that say "clear and unquestionable implication"? Marrero?     Is that -- is that the one case you rely on?       From a footnote in Marrero, right?       Yes.     Anything else?       Marcello?     Where -- what's the cite for that? I mean, there are a lot of earlier cases that make it clear when you're repealing a prior statute if it isn't express, it has to be at least a clear implication.     And I'm -- I'm astounded to think that in a footnote, we're suddenly going to change that to simply "fair implication."       Well, that's a different question.     And we can talk about that.     But how did Marrero come out?     Did it -- did it find an overruling or not?       So, it did not find 109 overcome by fair implication, right?       So, it's entirely dictum, right?     And dictum in a footnote.       I thought it was the other way.     The holding was that 109 governed.     No?       I thought you said the holding was that section 109 governed, that it had not been repealed.       Exactly.     And, therefore, whatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not repealed.     So, even if fair implication was the test, it was not the test applied and determinative in the case. So, it's dictum.     And dictum in a footnote.       All right.       Well, I'm not sure he's arguing that.     I think he acknowledges, as our opinions say, that it can be done by implication, but it has to be clear and unmistakable implication.     I think that's the position he's taking. Anyway, you want to tell me why this is clear and unmistakable?       Exactly, and I think we would come out that way.     I think you're entirely right. But the accelerated -- the direction to the Guidelines Commission to promulgate the guidelines on a -- on an emergency basis is not, as you just put it, for nothing. It has -       As Justice Alito was suggesting -       -- it has some effect.       So, it -- it's not comparable to what you've just said.       That's fine.     But it - they apply that applicable law to those, as you say, admittedly few people who have been prosecuted, convicted, and are now being sentenced under that applicable law.       There may not be many of them, but it does not -- it does not deprive that language of all meaning.       Well, no, you're begging the question.     The -- the law applicable to pre- - pre-statute offenses continues to be the prior law, and the applicable law to offenses that have occurred after the enactment date is the -       New guidelines to what people?     That's the issue.       If it's only new -- you're begging the question again.       If it's -- if it's only to people who have committed their offenses after that Act, then you have one set of applicable guidelines for those people, and you leave in effect, for people who committed their offense before the -- the enactment date, the prior guidelines.     I don't think there's anything necessarily implied by -- by this provision to the effect that -       -- there is only in the future one set of guidelines applied, you know, one guideline fits all.     I don't think that's -       Excuse me.     30a?       39a.       What is section 3742(g), which is -       Okay.     But I mean -- yes, that's very nice, but let's talk about text, not what about the emotions of Congress. This section that you quoted, (a) -- what, (4)(A)(ii) -       -- of section 3553(a) -       Is that in the new statute?       It was in effect -       It was not the amendment.       Congress didn't insert that -       -- when it made this amendment.     You're just saying that that is the incidental effect of the provision that Congress did adopt?       Of course, you could say that about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section 109.     I mean, that's what section 109 says:     Even though we have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty should be lesser, even though we've decided, when we do that, you continue to apply the bad old penalty to people who committed a crime before the amendment. Isn't that what 109 says?
11-597 +++$+++        Was Sanguinetti -- had we had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti?       In other words, was Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a temporary taking?     If the latter, that dictum if it's dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been overruled by our later temporary takings cases.       We have cases about flying overland -- -       -- cases about shooting -- shooting overland.     Right?       That's not water, but it ain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that Justice Breyer has talked about.       What if it hadn't harmed the timber?     I mean, you know, the damages claimed are a lot -- a lot of the timber that -- that would have been valuable was -- was impaired by these floodings. Suppose there'd been no harm at all?     Suppose it had just been for a certain period of time you were not able to use that land for anything?     You couldn't plant anything on it.     You couldn't picnic on it.     You couldn't do anything.     Would that have been -- nonetheless, despite the fact that there -- there was no harm done except -- except the flooding -- would that have been a taking?       Well, he has.     It's flooded.     He can't --       It does.     He can't plow on it.     He can't picnic on it.     How does that not interfere with his --       So it would be a taking. Are you saying yes or no?     What is it?       So our cases -- our cases treat physical occupations differently from other -- from other cases, don't they? The park ranger walking through can hardly be called a physical occupation.     He's harmed the land, but it's not a physical occupation. What you're -- what you're arguing here is that -- is that flooding the land is a physical occupation for the period that it's flooded.       Yes, but what you say -- here's what troubles me.     You say it has to be substantial.     But you -- can we -- can we fold into that word substantial a requirement that it have caused substantial financial loss? See, if that were the case, then -- then I could distinguish your case where a lot of valuable trees got destroyed.       And I wouldn't say every -- you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be a taking.       What was the Kansas City case that you are referring to?     I don't --
11-626 +++$+++        You should have phrased the test that way then, because it really --       That doesn't seem to me a very felicitous description of what -- of what the test is -- is enunciated to be.       The test is whether it's, what, practically able?       Practically capable.     Well, you could be practically capable of doing something, even though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up has nothing to do with that.       I understand.     I'm just saying we ought to get a different test, and let's -- let's get rid of this.     If we agree with you, let's get rid of this practically capable test, because practically capable, frankly, would make us come out the other way in this case.       Can I ask about that definition?     That definition comes from the Rules of Construction Act, right --       -- which provides the meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the United States Code.     Okay?       What -- what meaning of vessel in the United States Code is at issue here?
11-681 +++$+++    Suppose you have a policeman who -- who is dissatisfied with his wages. So he makes an appointment with the commissioner -- police commissioner, and he goes in and grouses about his wages. He does this -- you know, 10 or 11 times. And the commissioner finally is fed up, and he tells his secretary, I don't -- I don't want to see this man again. Has he violated the Constitution?   He has prevented a petition for a redress of grievances?   I really don't understand that. When -- when you -- so what if it's 10 policemen who do this? It's still not a matter of public concern? Or does it have to be the whole police force?   It seems to me it's always a matter of public concern, whether you're going to raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an individual policeman asking for that or -- or a -- a combination of policemen or a union. It's always a matter of public concern, isn't it?   Okay. To not -- not give this guy an appointment the 12th time.   Well, how can he shut his door if -- he has a right to petition, a constitutional right to petition for the redress of grievances? His grievance is he's not being paid enough.   But it's the same grievance if the union had presented it. The -- the grievance is the salaries for policemen are not high enough.   He's not asking for just his salary to be raised. He wants salaries of all -- all the cops to be raised.   Mr. Messenger, just to clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line of guestioning, it was simply to show that, if you have a case, it doesn't rest on the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It -- it rests on the First Amendment. You -- you say that there is being -- your -- your people are being reguired to support speech that they don't agree with.   Now, that is -- you know, that is an arguable position, but I don't -- I don't think it's even arguable that the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is -- is involved here.   That's a First Amendment violation, not a violation -- not a denial of the right to petition the government.   What -- what was the question? (Laughter.)   I want to hear the answer, too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests, I -- I didn't say your First Amendment argument was valid. (Laughter.)   I said at least it was a comprehensible argument. (Laughter.)   Why isn't it? I mean, it is for private employers. There are some private employers who think they're better off with a closed shop, and they just want to deal with one union, and -- and they require all the people that they hire to become a member of this union and to pay union dues for representational purposes. They do this as private employers because they think it is in their interest as an employer. Why can't the government have the same interest?   All right. But -- but don't tell me that there's no employer interest. There is an employer interest. You're just saying it is not -- it is not considerable enough, right?   I suppose -- I suppose the fact that you're entitled to speak against abortion would not justify the government in requiring you to give money to Planned Parenthood?   That's the argument you're making.   Those things, you can argue, are not part of the representation for which they should be charged, and they should get their money back for those things, if they're actually not -- not getting any benefit from them.   No, but they're -- I mean, what our cases say is you -- you can be compelled not to be a free rider, to -- to pay for those items of bargaining that benefit you, as well as everybody else. But you don't -- you don't have to pay for stuff that -- that is not within that description, stuff that doesn't benefit you at all.   But -- but it's only people who -- who disagree with the -- what the union's doing who could refuse to pay, you say? Right?   Why can't people who -- who agree with the union just say, hey, I don't -- I don't have to pay, the union is going to do this stuff anyway, I'm going to ride for free, these other people are riding for free?   Is there any -- is there any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and who's doing it on principle?   So -- so you're essentially destroying not just the -- not just the -- the -- closed shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union to -- to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing.
11-697 +++$+++        Do you mean by "lawfully made under this title," simply lawfully made in a manner that does not violate United States copyright law?       The standards, okay.     So -- so it could be lawfully made in England, let's say; in a country that has compulsory licensing, it could be lawfully made there, but it would not be lawfully made under our -- under our copyright law, because we don't have that.       So -- so at least they are correct in contending that what you are arguing for is -- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the United States copyright law had applied where it was made; is that what you are saying?       No?       I don't -- I don't follow that.       Right.       Okay.       Of -- of those -- of those courts that did hold the way your -- your opponent would -- would have it, am I correct that only one of them adopted the absolutist rule?

What -- what is the conviction?       What does the conviction mean?     You say the categorical approach.       Is -- is it the categorical statute under which you have been convicted or, as you seem to be saying, the indictment?       Is he convicted of that? Or is he convicted of violating Georgia Code 16-13, whatever it is?
11-713 +++$+++        I had thought, Mr. Clement, that -- that one of your objections was that in deciding whether they're using the benchmark or the -- the legislature's proposed new plan, whichever one they're using, they -- in drawing up their own plan, they assumed the validity of all of the challenges. Is -- is that not the case?       Why -- why shouldn't it be inverted the way your friend suggests?
11-770 +++$+++        May be?     There certainly is.     I mean, that was Summers, wasn't it?       Yes.     He wasn't on the premises, he was on the sidewalk, right?       He was in the curtilage of the house.       Excuse me.     Just the stop would be -- but -- but they did more than just stop them.     They --       -- they handcuffed them.       Mr. Shanmugam, please help me.     I -- I don't understand why -- why the Terry stop is at issue, inasmuch as there was not a Terry stop.     I mean, what occurred here went well beyond a Terry stop, did it not?     So what do you do?     You -- you slice the baloney that thin; you say well, the -- the first stop is a Terry stop.     Oh, yes, he later went on to detain them for a long time and put handcuffs on them and take them back to the premises.     What -- what relevance does the Terry stop have?       Well, I guess -- I guess, I just didn't realize that it's an open question whether you can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop.       Well, physical bounds of the property is -- is too much.     I mean, you know, what if it's a farm and it's a 50-acre farm?       I think you are much better off, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate vicinity.       I like that much better than boundaries of the property.       You're not saying that they can't stop them from leaving.     Have you said that; they can't stop them from leaving?       Well, you can say there was a historical basis for the rule, in that officers have always been allowed to take necessary action to protect themselves.     And that's the principal justification.
11-796 +++$+++        I didn't understand that last sentence.     Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans is violating the patent?       I thought that their claim is that he only violates the patent if he tries to grow additional seeds from his first crop.     Right?     Isn't that the only claim here?       No, not that seed.     It's different seed.     That seed is done.     It's been planted in the ground and has grown other seed.     It's the other seed we are talking about.     It's not the very seed that was sold.     Right?       I don't understand this.     I thought soybeans are seeds.       Including the Monsanto seeds?       Some of them would -- would grow at different rates than others.       But not the original batch that he buys from Monsanto?       The original batch that he buys from Monsanto, in addition to being resistant to the chemical that kills the weeds, in addition to that, they all mature at the same rate.       So all the Monsanto seeds are not -- are not fungible.       There are some of them that mature early, some mature late.       Do you agree that it's unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?       Yes, but -- but that's -- nothing prevents him from planting it.     What he is prevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of that planting, the second generation seeds, for another planting.     That's all he is prevented from doing.     He can plant and harvest and eat or sell.     He just can't plant, harvest, and then replant.       You know, you're saying that you are preventing him from using it.     He's not prevented from using it.     He can use it for what it's meant for, for raising a crop.     He just cannot use the product -- that new crop -- for replanting.     That's all. He has to sell that new crop for feed or for some other purpose.     But to say that -- that he's prevented from using what he has bought is simply not true.     He can use it, plant it, and harvest the crop.
11-798 +++$+++        Even though -- even though a related statute did -- did make an exception for proprietary action, isn't that right?     The FAAAA?       The ADA.       Boston Harbor was implied Page 9 preemption, right?       Some -- some of the rules Page 11 are okay, though, as you acknowledge, and I guess there's a second question in the case.       You were about to get into that anyway.       Okay.       Or you should stop referring to a key component of interstate commerce.     It doesn't matter whether it's key or not, does it?       Does the Federal government inspect trucks for safety and --   -- leaking hazardous materials and such?       Has it ever done that?       You -- you agree with that -- that that provision would apply?     I don't see that it applies.       Route restrictions?       I don't think there is. You think there is?     You can ask the question.       Seems to me the answer is no.       I didn't say they were a Page 53 red herring.
11-817 +++$+++        Are you for or against the dog this time?       For it.       I suppose that if the reasonableness of a search depended upon some evidence given by a medical doctor, the Court would not go back and examine how well that doctor was trained at Harvard Medical School and, you know, what classes he took and so forth, right.       You don't want coon dogs chasing squirrels.       Would you -- would you allow counsel to ask about that?
11-820 +++$+++        Well, it's always the case. I mean, we -- we never come out with a decision that doesn't rely upon some preexisting principle.     We always cite some preexisting principle.     Does that mean that every case of ours is -- is not new law?       Why pick on Strickland?     I mean, you could say that about any principle of law that we rely on:     The dissent thought that that principle applied a different way here. What is different about Strickland that it enables you to appeal to that, as opposed to appealing to any principle of law?       The only new law is not a new pronouncement which nobody had ever thought of before, but only a pronouncement that rests upon an evolution of mores; is that it?       That's what I thought you said.       Mr. Fisher, I suppose you are right, I'm sure you're right that the mere fact that there was a dissent in the case that adopted the rule does not necessarily make it a new rule.     But you, on the other hand, would agree, would you not, that those who dissented from that case would regard it as a new rule?       Well, I think it's an easy question to answer.       That's fair.     That's fair. The dissenters ought to reconsider, you're saying.
11-864 +++$+++        We must have thought that, I suppose, or else, we wouldn't have reformulated the question this way, right?       That's the way you put the question initially, and we reformulated it to be a Daubert question.
11-88 +++$+++        Really?     Congress got it from Judge Edwards?     Gee, I -- my goodness.       I'll bet you none of them -- none of them even read that opinion.       That is a strange phrase, "honest services," as -- you know, as a crime, deprivation of honest services.     But the word "individual" is not a strange --       -- word at all.     It's used all the time.       It means an individual.       Is that -- is that better for you or worse for you?       Well, suppose I'm a member of the House or of the Senate, and I'm not a member of the committee that engages in all of this legislative history.     And I -- I see the word "individual" in this statute, and that's the basis on which I vote for or against a statute.     Why should I be saddled with whatever sayings by members of the committee or by experts testifying before the committee occurred?     It was out of my hearing.     I voted for "individual." And "individual" -- well -- if Congress wanted "individual" to mean what you say it doesn't mean, what word would they have used instead?     I mean, if "individual" is a code word for person, what's the code word for individual? (Laughter.)       Maybe organizations opposed it.       Maybe organizations opposed the extension of the legislation to themselves.     Is that conceivable?       And is Congress ever influenced by -- by such lobbying? (Laughter.)       You don't find lobbying in the legislative history. (Laughter.)       But it's an explanation. You say there's no possible explanation.       I can imagine that corporations would have been quite upset by this notion.       This is the dog that did not bark, right?     Legislation cannot mean what it says unless the legislative history says that it means what it says.     Right?       Mr. Fisher, you -- it seems to me you misrepresent our jurisprudence when you insist that "individual" has to have only that meaning.     That's not what our jurisprudence says.     We say that we give words their usual meaning, their common meaning.     Even though they may sometimes be used in a different fashion, it's the usual or common meaning that we apply.       Many cases to that effect.       We say it all the time.       I -- I find it hard enough to parse the statute without having to parse Father Drinan's testimony.     I mean -- (Laughter.)
11-889 +++$+++        What is the exact language? Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh our recollection?
11-8976 +++$+++        Yes, but that -- is that an element of the crime?       It has to be raised by the defendant, right?       Which means it's not an element, so it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment.     Now, how can something that goes to the existence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be an element?       Well, you say that you -- you have to prove that the defendant was knowing and willfully a member of the conspiracy, right?       That's what you said?       Well, and you agree that that's the rule of law, right?       Doesn't duress eliminate willfully?       So why is that different from this?     If that's not an element, for Pete's sake, even though the definition of the crime is knowingly and willfully, and yet, nonetheless, that's -- that's an affirmative defense, why -- why is that any different here?       That doesn't prove that he withdrew.       Which -- which of those are affirmative actions?     I mean, the law is that he has to take an affirmative action withdrawing from the conspiracy.     I don't think being in jail is -- is an affirmative action.     I don't think being mad at the ringleader is an affirmative action.     I don't think any of the things you've said amount to an affirmative withdrawal from the conspiracy.       Maybe not, but it -- it may mean that we are wasting our time.       They didn't have to prove within the limitations period.     They didn't have to prove that.     You acknowledged that that the -- look, what's at issue here is not a defense of withdrawal. It's the defense of the statute of limitations, right?       You acknowledge that that is an affirmative defense.     And you are arguing that what establishes that affirmative defense in this case, namely, withdrawal, is an element.     How -- how can something that is -- that does nothing more than establish an affirmative defense be an element?       I can't understand that. Can you give me any other example in the criminal law where -- where --       But that's not an affirmative -- I want an example of something which is an affirmative defense and where the proof of that affirmative defense becomes an element.       Why doesn't it have to be contained in the indictment, if it's an element?       Why is it up to the defendant to raise it, if it's an element?       Okay.     That at least is logical.     I'm not sure it's right.     But it's logical.       But the government doesn't have to prove within the statutory period.     It's up to the defendant to raise that defense, and if he doesn't raise it, it's waived.
11-9307 +++$+++        What -- what about the time they come up here?     52(b) applies to every court, does it not?       So suppose there's been -- been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an uncertain question of law until the case gets here. Can -- can counsel argue that this Court should nonetheless review the case because, if we agree with counsel, thereupon, the law would be clear?     When we issued our decision, the law would be clear.       I -- I wonder how we would go about deciding whether we would take such a case or not.     We'd take all -- all those cases where counsel says, I didn't -- we didn't raise any of these objections, neither in the court of appeals nor in the district court; but, if you agree -- if you agree with me, Your Honors, that the law is thus and so, once you say that, that will make the decisions below clear error, and, therefore, you should be able to reverse it. Makes sense, right?       But when, as is the situation in this case, the law is uncertain at the time of trial, and there are some circuits that have gone one way, some circuits that have gone the other way, surely it greatly serves efficiency to bring that situation to the attention of the judge. He has a 50 percent chance of getting it right.     And if he gets it right, then the case is done. Instead, your -- your client did not raise any objection, and the judge just went ahead. Now, if -- if the error was plain, you can say, well, he didn't need an objection, any -- any dumb judge would have -- would have known this.     Okay?     So you make that kind of an exception.     But I don't see the reason for making that exception, where you could have brought this to the judge's attention, and he could have solved the problem; or, if he didn't solve it, maybe the prosecutor could have, by making some alteration in what he was demanding as a -- as a punishment or whatever. That -- that seems to me such a -- such a clear efficiency in the system.     I don't know what the efficiency is when you do it at the court of appeals level.     All you tell me is that, well, it saves you the trouble of going back and figuring out what -- what the situation was at the trial -- at the time of trial, right?     But you've got to go back to the time of trial anyway to decide whether -- whether substantial rights have been affected, don't you?       But -- but there's -- this brings you back to Justice Alito's question.     There's always an injustice when the district court has gotten it wrong.     The district court got it wrong, applied the wrong rule.     Justice has not been served. But we don't say, we want to do justice.     We say, we're only going to do justice if it was clear. Now, why -- why would you -- why would you have that limitation on it?     The only -- the only reason that limitation makes sense to me is -- is because when it is clear, it doesn't have to be raised below.     The judge ought to know better, anyway, and so you're not sacrificing any efficiency. But if the whole purpose of it is just to do justice, I don't understand the reason for the clear limitation.     Why should it only be when it's clear?       That's okay. (Laughter.)       Why -- why is that so?     Why is that so?     Why does -- does the effect upon the fairness of the proceedings change when it's sentencing or when it's the merits?     I don't understand that.       You're -- you're here complaining about sentencing.     That's a substantial issue, isn't it?
11-9335 +++$+++        You haven't distinguished MCMillan.     You've distinguished Harris.     How do you distinguish MCMillan?     Your -- your only grounds for distinguishing that is it was not a Sixth Amendment case, even though the opinion refers to the Sixth Amendment?       I don't care about "mostly."     The issue is whether MCMillan was a Sixth Amendment case, in part or in whole.     And I don't know how you can say it wasn't.     We -- we don't decide cases on -- on what a case mostly says.     We decide on what it says.       Why wouldn't that be a problem if -- if the question had to be decided by the jury?     Why does -- why does requiring it to be decided by the jury eliminate that -- that problem of the -- of the mixing or not mixing?       Ms. Maguire, could -- could you repeat the first sentence you uttered in this argument?     I -- I hesitated to jump in so early, but could you repeat it verbatim?     Maybe you had committed it to memory.     Good -- good counsel often does that. (Laughter.)       No, that wasn't it. (Laughter.)       I think what you said was who has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be subject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be subject to?     And the fact is that, in the case of a mandatory minimum, the defendant could have been given that mandatory minimum.     It was up to the judge. So this mandatory minimum does not increase the penalty to which the defendant is subject.     He's subject, in Justice Kagan's example, to any penalty between one years -- one year and 10.     The judge, even without the statute that she mentioned, could have given him seven years because he -- he brandished a gun. There -- there is really no -- no increase in the penalty to which he is exposed. And I thought that is what Apprendi addressed, any increase in the penalty to which you are exposed, so that when you decide, I'm going to rob a bank -- you know -- you know, when you go in, you are going to get between one and 10 years, and, with a mandatory minimum, you get between one and 10 years. So what's the complaint, as far as Apprendi is concerned?       It isn't leading to a more harsh -- more harsh sentence.     That's the whole point of Apprendi.     Does it lead to a sentence which is greater than the judge would otherwise be authorized to impose? And, in the case of a mandatory minimum, it never is. The judge could impose that, if he was a hanging judge. You know, you have some hanging judges; you have some bleeding heart judges. And -- and what a mandatory minimum simply says is -- you know, we don't care what kind of a judge you are, at least this much.     But it doesn't expose the defendant to any greater penalty.     He's -- he's at risk between one and 10 years.       That seems to me --       But you -- you quoted Apprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide any fact which increases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed.     That's the language you quoted, and it's accurate. Why does a mandatory minimum increase the sentence to which the defendant is exposed?     He could get the mandatory minimum sentence, even if there were no mandatory minimum prescribed.     He is exposed to a sentence of one to 10 years.     A mandatory minimum says, you must impose seven years if he brandishes. But the sentence to which he is exposed is one to 10 years.     And the mandatory minimum does not change that at all.     He is at risk for one to 10 years.       That's true.       That's true.     But you must acknowledge that that's not the theory of Apprendi.       I think the logic of Apprendi is that the jury has to decide it if it increases the sentence to which the defendant is exposed, not if it eliminates some discretion of the -- of the Court.     He's exposed.       It wasn't a mandatory minimum case.     Booker was a case in which the maximum was increased on the basis of judge finding of fact. The maximum was increased.     So, under the situation in Booker, the -- the exposure of the defendant was, indeed, increased on the basis of judge factfinding. Instead of one to 10, the statute in -- in Booker said, if you brandish a gun, you can get 15. That's a -- that's a quite different situation from saying, yes, you are still on the hook for one to 10, but, if you brandish, you got to get 7.
11-94 +++$+++        Was that jury trial constitutionally required?       Well, you have to do that because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a jury before the -- before the jury comes in or before the jury comes in with a penalty, right?       The most -- the most you must read out of it.       Yes.     You could -- you could say it could have meant -- they could have thought that they violated every day.       You can't say that for sure.     But one thing you can say for sure is that they found that it violated it 1 day.       Isn't that precisely what Apprendi said?     Is --       Yes. (Laughter.)
11-9540 +++$+++        But I thought our cases held that when you have a conviction for a weapons violation, you can look to the Shepard materials to decide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun, a knife or an ax, can't you?     No?       Or if -- you acknowledge if the State supreme court says "weapon" could mean a -- a gun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would suffice, right?     But if the supreme court doesn't say that, we cannot imagine it?       It's not spelled out as an element, but the State supreme court says, our statute says weapon.     Of course, a weapon could be a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, and then we look to the Shepard documents and we find that this conviction of a weapon violation was in fact based on the possession of a gun.       I think what you're saying is, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the jury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted of that particular crime.       The jury in finding him guilty of the generic offense could only have found that this mode of committing the offense was what he used. Nonetheless, he has not been convicted of using that mode; he has been convicted of the generic offense. Isn't that your point.       Well, you don't have to prove -- I mean, burglary is specifically named.     It's not -- it's not the residual --       It's not the residual. The -- the use or threatened use of force is the residual.     If you're convicted of burglary, it doesn't matter whether -- whether you threaten force, right?       Do you think only -- only those burglaries that -- that threaten force are covered by the statute?     Certainly not.     It's all burglaries, as long as you meet the generic definition of burglary, right?
11-965 +++$+++        Do we have to reach that question?     I mean, I guess the Ninth Circuit must have been interpreting the long-arm statute of California, right?       Now, are there -- were there California cases that disregarded the -- the corporate forum?       But the jurisdictional inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California statute, isn't it?       I see.     It's -- it's California's reference to the outer bounds of jurisdiction that causes -- causes this to be a constitutional case?       How do foreign -- foreign countries resolve this attribution question?     Would - would we be standing alone, or are there a lot of other countries that assert jurisdiction over the parent, if there is general jurisdiction over the sub?       "By and large"?     Who -- who are the small?       Counsel, I've been looking for the text of the California jurisdiction statute. Where is it?     I mean -- you know, that's what this case is all about, isn't it?       Is it in your brief?     Is it in the Respondent's brief?     Is it in the Government's brief?     I can't find the darn thing.       I don't want the cite.     I want the text in front of me, right here.       That's what briefs are supposed to have -       -- all -- all of the significant statutes that -- that relate to the case.       I don't have the California Civil Code -- you're saying it's -- it's not in the briefing?
11-982 +++$+++        Yes, and I assume that was your point, that you shouldn't be put through the trouble of figuring out whether the new shoes that you produce are close enough to the old one to be covered or are not.     You're at risk --       -- right?
11-9953 +++$+++        Mr. Bourke, was -- was it within the control of your client?       Was he unable to get his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial?       Why?       He had -- he had one counsel, right?     During the whole time?       Yes.     For part of it, he had two, and then there was not enough funding for the second, okay?     So he was faced with a choice. Louisiana, as I understand it, has adopted a provision, which the Sixth Amendment does not require. The Sixth Amendment just requires counsel, but Louisiana says, in capital cases, we are going to provide two counsel, and you can't go to trial until you have two counsel, okay?       No?       What is the State of Louisiana law?       Well, I don't -- I don't understand that.     That's not Louisiana law that you -- that you can't proceed without two counsel?     That's not the law in Louisiana?     I thought that's --       I -- you don't consider supreme court rules to be law?       Is it the fact that, in Louisiana, you cannot proceed to trial in a capital case, unless there are two counsel?       Then -- then you don't have a case.     You should have proceeded to trial.       Wasn't there, at all times, one counsel who was being paid by the State?       At all times?       Was that counsel qualified enough under our constitutional Sixth Amendment jurisprudence?       Well --       Well, the question is would only lead counsel under -- under the supreme court's rule qualify as competent counsel, for purposes of complying with the constitutional requirement?     Or would this certified second chair qualify?       Exactly.     I'm just saying can you establish that the one counsel that your client had throughout this whole -- whole proceeding would not satisfy the constitutional requirement? Can you -- is there any basis for your saying that?       What?       Not because of a Federal constitutional reason.     The court found, you are not complying with the supreme court rule.     You can't proceed without complying with the supreme court rule. It seems to me your client was faced with a choice:     You could either demand what Louisiana, in its generosity, has given to capital defendants, namely, the right to two counsel -- whether it's by statute or by supreme court rule, it doesn't matter -- you could either demand that right; or you could demand your right to a speedy trial.     That was your choice. And it seems to me what counsel chose was to insist, all along, I want my right to two -- to two counsel.     You didn't have to --       -- you didn't have to take that right.     You could have gone to the -- to the supreme court and said -- you know, since it's taking so long, I demand my constitutional right to a speedy trial.     But you didn't do that.       Of course, a finding by the district court -- or whichever court found it, that there was not enough money to pay counsel, to investigate, and to -- to do whatever else -- buy stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that there was not enough money to investigate and to buy stamps. Counsel was a part of that mix.     You never had a finding that there was not enough money to pay counsel, right?     Or -- I'm sorry -- that there was not enough money to allow the counsel that has been appointed to investigate and buy stamps. Was there ever any such finding?       The -- the big tag item was -- was paying counsel; wasn't it?       I don't think it's enough that none of the delay was attributable to the defense. The defense has to complain, has to demand its right to a prompt trial. What did your client do?     Frankly, I -- I am skeptical that a capital defendant who has already confessed to the crime wants to be tried as soon as possible.     I'm skeptical about that. Now, what -- what did your client do to demand his right to a prompt trial?       Right.       Well, that's -- surely, that's unconstitutional.     Did counsel say, I demand a speedy trial?     You can't condition my right to a speedy trial upon my getting some affidavit or something.       I'm still waiting for -- for anybody telling the court, I demand a speedy trial, and, if I don't get a speedy trial, you are violating the Constitution, and I ought to go scot-free.       Not -- not quite.     I mean, the question presented is not as general as that.     It's much more fact-bound. It says whether a State's failure to fund counsel for an indigent for five years, particularly where failure was the direct result of the prosecution's choice to seek the death penalty, should be weighed against the State for speedy trial purposes. I think this is inviting us to look into the facts of this case and decide whether this five-year delay, particularly since the prosecution chose the death penalty -- you know, I don't like having to do that and -- but it seems, to me, that's what the question presented at least requires.       The Constitution requires such a motion.     I mean, I don't care whether they have a -- you know, a speedy trial motion.     If -- if denying him the right to speedy trial violates the Constitution, surely, he is entitled to bring that to the attention of the Louisiana court, whether there's a specific statutory or rule provision or not.       Now, they -- they don't even want counsel to say -- you know, Your Honor, we've been trying to get funding, and we're -- we're just sick and tired of waiting for this.     We demand a speedy trial, and, if we don't get funding and, therefore, don't get a speedy trial, we think there's a constitutional violation, and we're going to ask that the indictment be dismissed.       Nobody ever made a statement like that to the Court, did they?       What did you say?       Dismissing it, instead of withdrawing it, that's the fine line he's drawing?       Is that a line in Louisiana law?     I don't know.     Does this -- this come from French law or something?     It seems, to me, withdrawing and dismissing sound, to me, the same thing.       Withdrawing his motion to quash.     So it was withdrawn, right?       Mr. Bourke, would you respond to the last point made by -- by opposing counsel?       You did state -- it's in Appendix J -- "Even if the murder indictment were quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution."       You told us, today, that that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution goes down the drain.     Which -- which is true?       Or assume that there isn't, right?
12-10 +++$+++        Say it again.     I didn't understand the point.       What do you mean by, Page 13 "partnering"?     How does this partnering differ -- partnering differ from just giving them the money to do the job?       I don't know what you -- what do you mean by, "partnering"?     You're just saying they are given money to carry out a particular program. Is that all --       Is that all you mean by, "partnering"?       To carry out a particular program?       I understand.     It is -- it is a naked grant of money to implement a particular program.       Okay.     And you call that "partnering with the Federal government"?       Terrible verb, anyway. (Laughter.)
12-1036 +++$+++       What are those?      Did not the Fifth Circuit decide that State law question?      And that's what I understood the Fifth Circuit to have held.
12-1038 +++$+++    Are there no sanctions for trespassing upon Federal property that is not a military base?   I -- I assume it would be contrary to -- to his orders to permit such installations, without his ability to control them.   Including by issuing debarment orders. He has no authority to do that, does he?   But that's not Respondent's theory here.
12-10882 +++$+++    But -- but we didn't -- we didn't base our decision in Atkins upon a study of what the American Psychiatric Association and other medical associations considered to be mental retardation. We based it on what -- what was the general rule that States had adopted. And a large number of States had adopted 70 as the criterion. I mean, the criterion is what do the American people think is the level of mental retardation that should make it impossible to impose the death penalty. We didn't look for the answer to that guestion to the APA or any of the other medical associations. We looked to what the States did. Now, what has changed in what the States do? Anything?   The SEM being -- being what and -- and established by whom?   For what purpose do they establish these scores? Is it for the purpose of determining who is so incapable of -- of controlling his actions that he shouldn't be subject to the death penalty? Is that -- is that what they're looking for when they establish 70 to 75? What are they looking for?   Right.   I'm not talking about IQ tests in general. I'm talking about why do they pick -- they used to pick 70. Now they pick between 70 and 75 as the upper limit. What are -- upper limit for what? I assume it is for people who would profit from medical treatment. Isn't that it?   They change -- they changed their mind, counsel. This APA is the same organization that once said that homosexuality was a -- was a mental disability and now says it's perfectly normal. They change their minds.   And they have changed their minds as to whether 70 or 75 is the -- is the new test -- for for mental retardation.
12-1117 +++$+++    I thought it said -- did it not say in its opinion that there was room for disagreement or whether this was reasonable or not? Did they have some such statement?   Yes, I'd like you to talk about that.   And is that -- is that how you think the jurisdictional question should be resolved, that whenever -- as you know, there's -- there's a disagreement in the courts of appeals as to what you do when there are claims that there are factual disputes. Some courts -- well, we've held that where the only issue raised is a factual dispute, there's no jurisdiction. Some courts say that so long as you assert a claim to qualified immunity, there is jurisdiction, okay. Let's assume that that's the rule. What do we do with factual disputes? Is it your position that you -- you simply assume them to be in the -- in the Respondents's favor?   Well, you would say genuine factual disputes. I mean, if -- if there's something that is not at all frivolous. I mean, it's not supported by the record, I wouldn't call that a genuine factual dispute.   And -- and how does that work out here?   You would say that it doesn't really matter whether he bumped the police cruisers when he was finally cornered, whether he tried to back up into one of the officers, that all of that is just excrescences, that it was enough to justify the shooting that he was driving at 100 miles an hour, swerving around the road, endangering human life and would likely continue that if they let him to get away?   Had admitted what?   Well, he does in his -- in his briefing here.   I could see how the passenger could complain, but -- but I can't see how the -- how the -- the criminal fleeing felon who put the passenger in danger can say, you shouldn't have shot because you -- oh, you hurt my passenger. Isn't there some problem of his standing to complain about that problem.   Mr. Bash, what's the government's position on the jurisdictional question?   Yes. I understand that. But what -- what about a dispute as to the purely factual issues, if there is a dispute about that? Does that mean the court can't -- can't take the case?   I know that. How would you resolve this struggle is what I'm asking you.   Yes, but Johnson involved only disputed facts. They asked this Court to resolve the factual question, period. I understood Johnson to say of course you can't take that. But we have here a case where, although there may be disputed facts, the other side would say -- or your side would say that they are irrelevant.   Okay. And you would agree that we should resolve them in the Respondent's favor to the extent that the record supports that?   We don't care about the seconds.   Place it in the context.
12-1128 +++$+++ 
12-1146 +++$+++    It's certainly not measurable. The agency doesn't even assert that it's measurable, right?   I didn't read them as saying that anyway. I read them as saying they'll try to do it, but make whatever exemptions are necessary.   It -- it clearly is not a matter of the EPA simply saying we can't do it right away, but we're going to do it eventually.   It hasn't said that.   One, you were going to discuss not just the Massachusetts case, but the follow-on case to Massachusetts.   You never did that, yes.   The other thing -- you were going to give two points and you only got to -- what is it -- 7411(e), but there was another point.   You got the first, which was the --   Right.   Well, you -- you'd accept his definition, wouldn't you? You'd be happy with a definition that says air pollutant means any air pollutant to the extent it can be sensibly controlled under the statute. And you would say this one obviously can't.   So that would be a wonderful definition.
12-1163 +++$+++ 
12-1168 +++$+++    You know, I should probably ask this of the other side, and I will, but do you happen to know when was the last time that Massachusetts prosecuted somebody for obstructing entrance to an abortion clinic?   So there have been laws against obstruction during this entire period, right?   And you say that only once, in 1997, that was the last time a prosecution was brought.   In Schneider, they were held not so far back that their shouts and protests couldn't be heard. Isn't that the case? They could still be heard --    they were not out of earsight   Counsel, do you accept that the record here shows that it did not work well in the sense that Justice Breyer --   -- seems to use it?   As I recall the record, all -- all it says is that the police found it difficult to apply a bubble; that -- you know, they have to measure 8 feet or whatever it is. They didn't say that massive obstruction and protests are occurring, preventing people from -- that wasn't the finding, was it?   And if you know they're going to the clinic.   It is the case, isn't it, that not only abortion counselors are -- are excluded from this area, everybody is, right? Anybody who wants to talk to anybody or who just wants to be there --   -- can't  I mean, this is a -- a dead speech zone, right?   Excuse me. If  if you're going through the zone just to get somewhere, not to get to the clinic, and you're walking with a companion, can't you speak to your companion as you walk -- it doesn't ban speech by everybody who's walking through.
12-1173 +++$+++    Counsel, you are not reading this, are you?   Oh, that's nice. Do you know of any other real estate thing which says it's an easement for one purpose and the fee for another? The government absolutely denied in Great Northern, didn't it? It was -- that was the government's case; this was not a fee.   They didn't say it's a you know, for some purposes it is. They said it was not a fee. And that's what the Court held, contrary -- in accordance with what the government wanted, right?   And that case has been around for how long?   Okay. And the case explicitly says it's an easement. And people have been buying and selling real estate I assume in reliance on that case for -- for that entire period of time. And now the government has this new theory that for some purposes it's a fee; for some purposes it's an easement. That's not what Great Northern said.   I assume your answer would be that if it's a choice between disappointing people who properly relied on the law, and disappointing people who were -- were not following the law, it's clear who should -- who should take it in the neck. It's the latter, isn't it?   I don't understand how that can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to what the government says. I mean, is that what you are telling us?   The Interior says one thing and the Justice Department here says something else? I mean, we have a president who reconciles these two things. He must agree with one or the other.   I'm sure the government will have an explanation as to why we shouldn't.   Have you even heard of the term "limited fee" until this case? I never heard it.   A. James Casner didn't talk to me about limited fee.
12-1182 +++$+++    Of course, those -- those savings would -- would not be evenly distributed among the upwind States, right? So some upwind States that are able to make those efficient changes will be carrying more than their burden of reducing the emissions that affect downwind States, right?   Well, I don't mind a State doing less. I think North Carolina said -- said that you can use those cost figures to do less, and that's not challenged here. But what the application of the cost factor means is that some States that can more efficiently make the changes will be reguired to do more than merely account for their proportion of the downwind harm. Isn't that true?   Yes or no? I mean, I think it's an easy yes or no answer.   Have you answered my guestion? Does -- does the fact that you begin with -- what the statute says is that each upwind State has to account for its -- its effect on the downwind States, but once having identified that effect, you -- you then say those upwind States that can make the reductions more efficiently have to make more reductions than they -- than their mere proportion of the harm reguires. Isn't that so?   And what provision of the statute allows you to take that into account?   I mean, as opposed to each State, whether it's inefficient or efficient, has to merely reduce its contribution to the downwind State pollution, right? That's what the statute says.   The problem is that that allocation among different actors is done State by State, and simply taking costs into account as determining who will do what simply eliminates the -- the reguirement that each State not be -- not be reguired to do more than its share of the pollution it's -- it's causing downstream. It's the State-by-State reguirement that makes it very difficult to think that all Congress wanted was the most efficient reduction of pollution, no matter where that pollution came from. That's simply not what the statute envisions.   And maybe that'd be a better statute. Maybe it shouldn't be State by State.   If Congress wanted that, why couldn't Congress simply have said, the EPA shall prescribe minimum pollution reduction measures that have to be taken by the States? That's a quite different statute from what we have before us. But what you're saying is -- you know, you -- you reduce it this -- this much, as much as efficiency will allow, or else, you're in violation of -- of the good neighbor rule. And that's a very different statute from what Congress wrote. Maybe it's a good idea. Maybe EPA ought to control all -- all efficiency measures for reducing pollution, but it's certainly not the statute that Congress wrote.   Excuse me. I don't understand that. Please say that again.   Oh, but that's crucial. I mean, it would have no idea whether EPA would use any or would pick $500 or would pick whatever. I mean, I don't know how it could sensibly design a -- a program without knowing that.   Can you give us an example of when EPA has done this in the past, where a -- a crucial element of a -- of a NAAQS has not been defined by the agency, and yet, the agency, nonetheless, reguires the States to -- to put together their SIPs without knowing what their target is? And that's the problem here. What's your best example of another case in which the agency said, you -- you put together a SIP, and we're not going to tell you what the target is.   Well, that just means it's pin the tail on the donkey. Some States got the tail. I mean -- you know, they pinned it in the right place. That doesn't prove anything. I want an example of another instance in which EPA has -- has hidden the ball, has said, we're not going to tell you what the target is, it's up to you to come up -- up with a SIP, and we'll tell you after the fact whether that SIP happened to meet the target that we've invented.   All right. All right.   Okay.   Yes. That just means there's some facts that they don't know. Of course, there are always going to be uncertainty about certain facts. But here, there is uncertainty about the target, not just about the facts. We don't know what target we're expected to hit.   I suppose you could average them out, couldn't you?   I don't think that's any more irrational then picking a number like 500 bucks as -- as to -- you know, what the -- who can do it more efficiently. That's sort of arbitrary.   I understand that, but my point is that is certainly a pretty -- pretty arbitrary number, and -- and I think averaging for all the receptors is certainly no more arbitrary.
12-1184 +++$+++    Well, what do you -- what do you want to add to meritless? Don't you have to add something to meritless? I mean, every time you win the summary judgment motion, that's a determination that the claim is without merit, isn't it?   Doesn't meritless just mean without merit?   Okay. I understand. Well, all right. What -- what must be added to the word meritless?   That no -- no reasonable judge could have found it to be with merit?   That -- that's not a standard I would -- I would want to, you know -- you realize how -- how differently various district courts would operate if -- if you just say -- what was your phrase? Unreasonably weak?   You've got to give me something tighter than that.   I don't understand your answer to the question. How does the first part of the Federal Circuit's test differ from your perception of what meritless means?   Mr. Telscher, it occurs to me that you really cannot answer the question of what adjectives should be attached to meritless. And the reason you can't is, since it is a totality of the circumstances test, that is only one factor and it doesn't have to be an absolute degree of meritlessness. Even in a - I assume you would say that even in a very close case, if there has been outrageous litigation abuse by the other side, the court would be able to say: My goodness, I've never seen lawyers behave like this. You're going to pay the attorneys' fees for the other side. Couldn't the -- couldn't the court do that?   So then how can we possibly define meritless? We can't, because it goes up and down, even in a case where it's -- it's a close case, it could still be exceptional.   No matter what other factors exist, it has to be objectively unreasonable.   I mean, even if it is clear from other factors that this is a shakedown, a big country -- a big company trying to suppress a little company, even if it's clear that there has been outrageous litigation abuse, misconduct by attorneys?   All of those things cannot justify shifting the award unless it is objectively unreasonable.   Oh, okay.   You want to add et cetera, right?   But it's in the Senate report, so -- (Laughter.)   So if that's what you mean, why don't you say exceptional injustice instead of gross injustice?   To the Senate -- to the Senate report.
12-1200 +++$+++    Which is where? Where are you reading?   I don't know why it wasn't in your brief.   What is the ambiguity we are talking about?   What is the non-ambiguity we are talking about? (Laughter.)   If -- if -- if we believe that the word "determine" means make a final judgment, which you assert it means, so that there's no ambiguity, it seems to me you have a statute in which the bankruptcy judge is only authorized to make recommendations in some situations and to make final judgments in others. And surely, there's a problem with a district judge altering that disposition --   -- by just saying, oh, I know you're supposed to make a final determination, but just for fun, give me your recommendation. I mean, that is just contrary to the statute.   Congress might have -- might have provided that if it had known about Stern, right? (Laughter.)   But do we sit here to write the statutes that Congress would have written --   -- if they knew about some future events? I don't think so.   Counsel, is Article III not violated so long as the parties are happy?   Can the parties agree to have a -- an Article III court decide a case it has no jurisdiction to decide, and so long as no harm is done to the parties, it's okay?   You're confusing me. I thought you -- you did say that there can't be implied consent or even express consent to what happened here. Isn't that your position?   Express or implied.   I thought that's what --   They didn't say that it's okay without consent.   They just say it is okay with consent. They didn't address the point.
12-123 +++$+++        I assume this is one of those difficult merits questions you were alluding to, it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the partnership in question, isn't it?       I don't -- I don't see how it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question before us.       Well, some of the raisins were their own.     Some of the raisins were their own.       At least as to that, that wouldn't be true, right?       Why?     Why -- why does it withdraw for the one and not the other?       No, I don't mean the policy.     I don't mean the policy reason.     What in the law leads you to that conclusion?       What was the first?     I forgot the first already.     What was the first?       What -- what isn't jurisdictional?
12-126 +++$+++        Where -- where is that in the text?     What are you relying on in the text of 2244?       You -- you don't have (b)in your brief, do you?       That is very -- that is unfortunate.       If you're relying on it, I mean.
12-1281 +++$+++    Well, surely, you would -- you would argue the de facto officer doctrine.   Of course, you would.   And we've applied that in innumerable cases. You don't really think we're going to go back and rip out every decision made.   You started off by saying -- you know, it would -- it would repudiate so many actions that have been taken. I have a very, very stark question: Suppose I agree with the court of appeals that the only -- the only interpretation of -- of the Constitution is that the vacancy must have arisen during the recess, just by hypothesis. I agree with that, okay? What do you do when there is a practice that -- that flatly contradicts a clear text of the Constitution? Which -- which of the two prevails?   So if you ignore the Constitution --   -- often enough, its meaning changes?   Now, you're -- you're questioning my hypothesis. You have to accept my hypothesis.   Let's assume that the text is clearly against you. Should I say, oh, yes, it -- it says something else, but the practice for over 200 years has been something different, and it's the practice that must prevail.   Yes or no?   Does the practice prevail over the clear text --   You're questioning my -- my hypothesis again.   I am assuming a clear text of the Constitution and a practice that is -- is contrary to it.   You do not want to answer my hypothesis.   Well, let's  let's talk about your 1948 emergencyof the Secretary of Labor. There was a vacancy in -- in that post. The President has the authority to convene Congress. And whatever was the case in 1948 or -- or in 1789, Congress can be back here in one day. Article II, Section 3 says, "He may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both houses."   So what's the problem? If there is indeed this -- you know, this terrible emergency you're talking about, the President has the power to call them back.   Yes, but my only point is what -- what the recess appointment power consists of cannot be determined on the basis that, well, there are going to be terrible emergencies, so it must enable the President to do this or that. Extraordinary emergencies are handled in the Constitution. You don't have to expand the -- the vacancy appointment power in order to handle those.   Of course. Death is an enduring state. But if someone dies in 1941, you don't say he died in 1945. He's still dead. (Laughter.)   But his death happened in 1941.   Well, that was that Senate. I mean, that's not the Senate that is sitting now. You are attributing the views of one Senate to the Senate over -- over time.
12-1315 +++$+++    Let's  let's take your second point. What a statute of limitations says is not that you are -- are scot-free within the statute of limitations period. It simply is a negative. It says you can't be sued beyond that, right?   So it seems to me there is nothing -- if -- if we adopted the position of the other side, there's nothing that would cause the statute of limitations to be frustrated.   Yes, but it continued to be used in equity, even when there were limitations period, didn't it? It may have started that way, but that was certainly not its only use.   Well, it was Federal law. Federal law adopted it. It was Federal law.   But they originated in equity, just as laches did. The tolling rules originated in equity. They were brought into law. What troubles me about this case is this: Did the adoption of the new Rules of Federal Procedure disable courts from bringing over anything else from equity into law? Tolling used to exist. It was brought over into law before the new Rules of Civil Procedure. And therefore, you would not be altering any substantive right to continue to apply that tolling rule. Your argument here is -- is that to apply laches is to alter a substantive right, and therefore, under the -- under the Rules Enabling Act is not allowable. My question is this: Do you think that the Rules Enabling Act prevented courts from doing what they had in the past? That is, not using the Act as the means of saying everything that was in equity is now in law, but rather sitting back and thinking -- you know, here's another part of equity that should be brought over into law, not because the Act says so, but because we think it ought to be, just as we thought, 50 years ago, the tolling -- the -- the tolling provision should be brought over into law. Have courts been -- been disabled from doing that by reason of the Act?   But it says, "The rules shall not alter or amend any substantive right." And what I'm saying is it isn't the rules that do it. It's just we have made the independent justification that this ancient rule, which was applied in equity, ought to be applied in law as well.   Yeah, but the -- the mortgagor does -- does not invest substantial amounts of money the way MGM did here, on the assumption that, since suit hasn't been brought for 20 years, there's -- there's no valid claim. I mean, that's the difference in that situation. You're talking about inducing -- or causing at least, people who -- who proceed in good faith on the assumption that 20 years have gone by. Nobody -- nobody has questioned our doing it. They invest substantial amounts of money, and then, when that money starts to pay off, you file suit and -- and you get three years' worth of -- of their profits.   Why can't we change our mind? Why can't we change our mind?   And you say that none of the other instances in which we brought into law equitable doctrines, none of those were applied with respect to a prior enacted Federal statute? Is that your position?   Well, I'll have to look it up.   There was a long history that tolling didn't apply at law, and then we changed our mind.   And you're saying we -- we never changed our mind where there was a statute of -- Federal statute of limitations? I -- I don't believe that.   Could that equitable remedy overrule the statement that you're entitled to sue for all the profits within that 3-year period? You're saying the injunction can -- can, in effect, say you don't have to pay?   Well, I understand that, but does the second eliminate the first? If it doesn't eliminate the first, Justice Breyer's point is absolutely correct.
12-133 +++$+++        I guess you could have said the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 existed, right?       Before there was such as thing as class actions.       The same thing would have been true.     If, indeed, your claim was so small that you can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical matter, don't bring the suit.       I suppose that American Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at all, right?     They could have just said -- you know, you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court, right?     They could say that, legally, couldn't they?       And until Rule 23 was adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small claim, tough luck, right?     De minimis non curate lex. If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to bring a Federal claim.     And that would not violate the Sherman Act, would it?       But they could borrow the money from a lawyer instead of from the trade association, right?       I'd like to hear the answer, if nobody -- (Laughter.)
12-135 +++$+++        You're -- you're saying that this is off the wall.     That's your -- to put it in -- in Justice Ginsburg's terms, right?       So you're saying -- you're saying that the -- that the deference which we give to arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact, right?       Do you have other examples from other -- other review that we've given to arbitrators' factual decisions?       I mean, I -- I don't want to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but if -- if you're telling me this is just a general principle, that at some point if it's too much off the wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can reverse it.     What -- what other examples do -- do we have?       No, I want a case. You're --       But that is a class action case.     I -- I don't care what it said.     I want a --       I want a case where we have, or where Federal courts have with our approval, disregarded a -- a factual finding by an arbitrator because the factual finding was too much off the wall. That there was simply not enough basis to support it.
12-1371 +++$+++    Are threats of violence domestic violence?   I hope not. I hope not.   Do we have to think that domestic violence is different from violence? Wouldn't the simple term "violence," without the "domestic" adjective cover any physical abuse that causes harm?   If I punch somebody in the nose, is that violence?   If I punch somebody in the nose.   Okay. So do you have to have a special rule for if I punch my wife in the nose?   Any physical action that hurts somebody is violence, isn't it?   Maybe I am missing something here, but I thought Justice Ginsburg's question was not addressed to the Federal statute, but to the Tennessee statute.   And it's the Federal statute that uses physical force, right? What does the Tennessee statute say?   Causing bodily injury.   So your position is whenever -- whenever somebody is injured by reason of the intentional act of somebody else, that has been an application of violent force.   Wait. Domestic strife? I mean, my goodness. All we have to find is domestic strife?   Whenever there's domestic strife, guns are dangerous?   Clearly, that's not what Congress had in mind.   Okay.   I don't know why you have to tie this to domestic -- domestic violence. Why do you -- it's no different from physical abuse of anybody else.   Well, how many -- how many include? Just how many include mere touching as --   Well --   What do you want us to do with those 14 that don't separate it out? And let's assume the case law doesn't -- what do you want us to do? Are they covered by this statute or not?   Just touching. Just touching, is it --   How do we get to the common law meaning of "force"? I mean, the statute does -- Federal statute doesn't say that, right? The Federal statute says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, right?   Yes, of course. In interpreting the meaning of a term in the definition, you take into account the term that that definition is defining. And in Johnson we did that, and we always ought to do it. And here the term that the definition which uses the term "physical force" is defining is "domestic violence." And to give "force" in that context its common law meaning, which would include the mere touching, it seems to me is -- is an abuse of the principle that the defining term must be -- must be interpreted in the context of the term that is being defined.   It distinguishes Johnson, but it doesn't get rid of the word "violence," which is -- which is what is being defined.   You are saying violence is being defined as a mere touching. I think that's a stretch.
12-138 +++$+++    Say that again.   By reason of --   Yes.   I must say I don't follow that -- that line of argument. I mean, it seems to me the treaty sets the framework for an agreement, but it is ultimately the agreement that governs.   But that's no different from the rules we apply when there isn't a treaty, of course. I mean, if the arbitration agreement said that, that the -- you know, the agreement is conditioned on, of course. So what else? What different rules would you apply, other than the common-sense rules that we use for arbitration agreements?   We would look to mandatory language in the arbitration agreement.   They say that only the complaining party can bring a lawsuit. Evidently, they have no declaratory judgment procedure in Argentina.   I was going to ask them that.
12-1408 +++$+++    You have to acknowledge, though, that if you read -- if you read the two sections of the statute together, the one seems to be unnecessary.   "Wages" means all remuneration, including cash value of all remuneration, including benefits. And then (o) says "extension of withholding of certain payments other than wages. For purposes of this chapter, any supplemental and unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages," suggesting that it really isn't.   I mean, there would have been a way to fix the revenue rulings without doing it this way. Couldn't they have done it some other way without enacting a statute that contradicted itself?   Yes, unless it was in a section that said how to treat men who are not 6 feet tall. The title of this section (o), "extension of withholding to certain payments other than wages."   I mean, it -- it clearly suggests that these are not wages.   Right.
12-142 +++$+++        I would like to hear your answer.
12-144 +++$+++        I guess the attorney general of this State doesn't have any proprietary interest either, does he?       But -- but he can defend it, can't he -       -- because the law says he can defend it.       Mr. Cooper, let me -- let me give you one -- one concrete thing.     I don't know why you don't mention some concrete things.     If you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's - there's considerable disagreement among -- among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not.     Some States do not -- do not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason.       I don't think we know the answer to that.     Do you know the answer to that, whether it -- whether it harms or helps the child?       But that's a possible deleterious effect, isn't it?       I -- it's true, but irrelevant.     They're arguing for a nationwide rule which applies to States other than California, that every State must allow marriage by same-sex couples.     And so even though States that believe it is harmful -- and I take no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it is certainly true that -- that there's no scientific answer to that question at this point in time.       I suspect this Court would hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, don't you think?       Strom Thurmond was -- was not the chairman of the Senate committee when Justice Kagan was confirmed. (Laughter.)       It's too late for that, too late for that now, isn't it?     I mean, we granted cert. I mean, that's essentially asking -- you know, why did we grant cert.     We should let it percolate for another -- you know, we -- we have crossed that river, I think.
12-1493 +++$+++    Please finish what you were saying. I -- I didn't understand what your point was.   I suppose -- I suppose that your answer to what sense it makes is that was the compromise, that there was strong opposition to any gun control law, and the condition was you get the buyer, and you don't make the buyer promise not to give it to somebody else. He could immediately give it to somebody who's unqualified to own the gun, couldn't he? Would that be a violation?   What about somebody -- somebody who is qualified to own a firearm? Can I take a firearm that I own and say -- you know, it's yours?   Don't have to register it? I don't have to go through a firearm dealer, right? It's my gun, and I can give it to somebody else who's qualified.   So you're never going to know who the end user is once the gun is sold, whether you take the -- you know, the straw buyer's name or the -- or the other person's name or both. You don't know where the gun is going to end up, do you?   He made that up. (Laughter.)   And in some cases, they can track it all the way. In this case, unlike the hypothetical that Justice Alito gave you, if they went to the straw, to the straw purchaser, he would say, oh, I actually bought it from my uncle. And he'd give the uncle's name, and then the uncle would say -- you know, where else the firearm went from him.   What is the government's -- I guess I should ask the government, but does the government contend that there are two buyers now? Both -- is the real buyer the person who sends in the straw man so that it's only his information that you have to give? Or are there two buyers?   Could  could you address the other -- the other point here, which is the one I have more trouble with, to tell you the truth, Count 2?   Can you lie in -- in answering questions that the government has no technical right to answer? I mean, let's assume I agree with you that, in fact, this information was -- the government was not authorized to obtain this information, and therefore, it was not required to be kept. But nonetheless they asked it, and your client didn't just say, I won't answer. He lied. Now, can you -- can you lie, so long as the question is improper?
12-158 +++$+++       Well, we didn't take this case to -- to decide the Commerce Clause question, did we?    The government didn't even assert it below.    It asserts it now, but as we took the case, the issue was whether the treaty supported the laws.      Mr. Clement, I -- I don't understand how -- how you distinguish Sarin gas.    Why is Sarin gas different from vinegar?
12-167 +++$+++  
12-17 +++$+++       When -- when was the first of those laws enacted?    Do you know?    I think it's -- I think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the first to enact a sunshine law.     Is that -- am I correct about that?      In the '60s.      And you say that's a fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until the 1960s?      But those -- those rights still exist in this State, don't they?     Cannot you get records of deeds and whatever the common law would have covered?      Well, I'll ask them -- I didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but      Mr. Gupta, I -- I understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA    requests is the following:    That the purpose of these - these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were enacted -- government in the sunshine.    The purpose of it was not to enable people to get information, per se; it was to enable people to see how their government is working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance that is occurring in the process of government. It seems to me entirely in accord with that purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens who -- who are concerned about the functioning of Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever records Virginia agencies have. What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?      But -- but you don't need any personal or property interest under these laws.    You can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency for records about this or that.                     It -- it can't be based on -- on the traditional property interest.    It's based on the ability of the citizens of the State to find out what the -- what the government of the State is up to.      But that -- that just goes to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the principle.    And you say extent doesn't matter.    You say there's no such thing as a de minimis exception.      So that -- that explanation doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water.       So what?     So what?     Except to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an imposition this is upon interstate commerce.    It seems, to me, that's the only relevance of that point.       And -- and you dismiss that relevance.    You say it doesn't matter how extensive the impact is on -- on interstate commerce.      It's just Virginia media, though, isn't it?    Isn't it only media that -       -- exists or is broadcast     into       Well, that's consistent with their purpose, that this statute is meant to assure good, honest government in Virginia.      But they -- but they just don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders mucking around in -- in Virginia government.    It's perfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but they don't want outlanders to do it.     Why -- why is that      Excuse me.    The -- I -- I think what he's saying is you don't have to pay the costs of developing and maintaining those records, which costs are paid by the citizens of Virginia, which gives them an additional interest in being able to get to those documents. You -- you don't claim that -- that you pay for the development and the maintenance of those records.     You just pay for the incremental costs of giving it to you, right?      And Virginians pay for all the rest?
12-207 +++$+++        That proves absolutely nothing.       So that's its purpose, to enable you to identify future criminals -- the perpetrators of future crimes?     That's the purpose of it?     I thought that that wasn't the purpose set forth in the -- in the statute.       I know. (Laughter.)       Yes, but our -- our search incident to arrest cases don't allow that.     That's sort of the point.     They -- they allow you to search for firearms, they allow you to search for material that relates to the crime for which the person has been arrested. But you can't search the person for other stuff.       Well, wait.     Evidence relating to matters other than the crime of arrest?       Yes, but, if we believe that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's legitimate or not, you can't demonstrate that the -- that the purpose is immediate identification of the people coming into custody, you just can't demonstrate that now.     Maybe you can in 2 years. The purpose now is -- is the purpose you began your presentation with, to catch the bad guys, which is a good thing.     But -- you know, the Fourth Amendment sometimes stands in the way.
12-236 +++$+++        Yes, one of -- one of your -- your argument you were making is that there -- since the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of the case, it should not be construed to apply to the -- the failure to meet the filing deadline. Is -- is that true?     I mean, the statute says if the judgment does not award compensation, on a petition filed under Section 300aa-11 -- if the judgment does -- is there no judgment when a -- when a case is dismissed for failure to meet the statute requirement?       Wait, so --       Other than the judgment. Okay.     So then -- then your argument that -- that this fee provision looks to the end of the case simply doesn't fly.     It looks to the beginning as well, if indeed dismissal for failure to comply with the time limit is a judgment.       Well --       Okay.     That's just repeating your -- your first argument.       That petition means -- means a petition properly filed, but I don't see that the -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's Page 14 at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys' fees looks to the end of the case and not to the beginning.     It looks to the judgment.     And if it's a judgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply with the statute, it's still a judgment.       That's your first argument. I understand.       Well, wait.     Congress has waived sovereign immunity.     It's absolutely clear that there's a waiver of sovereign immunity here.       And once we find that, I don't think we nitpick the following language to unrealistically narrow it as much as possible.     I mean, the initial question of whether Congress has agreed to be sued is, yes, we -- we assume it hasn't and -- and -- but -- but once it's clear that it has agreed to be sued, I think we just interpret the language reasonable.

12-25 +++$+++        North of trolling?
12-3 +++$+++       Well, that's sort of peculiar.    I mean, really, I don't see how you can piece it out like that, that it includes employees of contractors, subcontractors, but not -- not of any officer. But let me ask you this:    If it does include employees of -- of an officer, is it -- is it as much of a disaster as -- as your opponent suggests?    That is to say, would -- would a firing for something that had nothing to do with the securities laws be swept in?      But it is -      It is limited to those subjects.    And is -- is the personal employee of an officer likely to be involved with any of those subjects?      Of course, it also rules out the accounting firm that is only used once, right?      Well, you just hire them for this one audit; are they a contractor?      I'm not sure.    Does that mean yes or no to his question?      Why?    Why is it a possible reading?    It makes a lot of sense, I agree with that.      I understand that, but - but I think you're -- I don't agree with you that - that we don't have to get into these -- these other situations, because to my mind, the principal argument made by the Respondent is if you read the statute literally the way you like, it covers a wide range of things that -- that one would have no reason to believe Congress wanted to cover.    And unless you come up with some -- with some limiting principle that -- that eliminates that argument, I'm not inclined to go along with your -- your broad interpretation of the statute. So, I at least do have to grapple with - with whether there are limitations, with -- with what is -- what is the central mainstream of the statute and - and what is outside the statute.      This is not the Petitioner's position, however.    The Petitioner takes a broader -- a broader interpretation as I understood him.
12-307 +++$+++        Excuse me.     If there is no jurisdiction here, why was there jurisdiction at the trial level?       I mean, the government comes in and says "I agree" -- or if there was jurisdiction, why did the Court ever have to get to the merits? If you have a, let's say, a lawsuit on an -- on an indebtedness and the alleged debtor comes in and says, yes, I owe them money, but I'm just not gonna pay it, which is the equivalent of the government saying, yes, it's unconstitutional but I'm going to enforce it anyway. What would happen in that -- in that indebtedness suit is that the court would enter judgment and say, if you agree that you owe it, by God, you should pay it.     And there would be a judgment right there without any consideration of the merits, right? Why didn't that happen here?       Really, that's very peculiar.     When -- when both parties to the case agree on what the law is?     What, the -- just for fun, the district judge is -- is going to have a hearing?       I'm not talking about jurisdiction now.     I'm talking about why the district court, without getting to the merits, should not have entered judgment against the government.      I didn't understand that courts were so central to your position.    I -- I thought you didn't want the voters in one State to dictate to other States any more than you would want the courts in one State to dictate to other States.
12-315 +++$+++    I'm  I'm not sure it you said it is conceded that -- that those things should have been brought to the airline's attention. Has that been conceded? I'm not sure.   I think -- I think they said if it -- if they were brought, they should have been brought in a different fashion, but I'm not -- I'm not sure they -- they have conceded that.   Well, you could convey anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that.   But does defamatory reguire that it be materially false? Can't I defame somebody with a statement in -- in which the derogatory information is not material to anything at all, but it's just derogatory?   Has to be materially false to sustain what?   But it would still support a defamation, wouldn't it?   Because it is material to the person's reputation.   Yes, you could say he's nuts, but the guestion isn't whether somebody would say it. The guestion is whether that is false. I mean, the mere fact that -- that a lot of people will -- will exaggerate and say things that are simply not true doesn't make it okay.   But the point is that somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or whatever it was, was material, whether -- whether it would have made any difference to TSA if it had been described otherwise. And in this case, as I understand it, as -- as the Colorado supreme court said, nobody has made that determination; right? The Colorado supreme court says it doesn't make any difference whether -- whether it would have affected TSA or not, putting it -- putting it the proper way, right?   So that's what we're confronted with, simply, the -- the need for somebody to make that factual determination, right? And you're saying what? There's no need to make it at all?   There are two -- there are two different issues of falsity that we're talking about here, of materiality. One is the defamation issue, and it is material to say that somebody is mentally unstable when all that he did was lose his temper. Okay? That's my view of it. That does not answer the guestion of whether calling him mentally unstable, instead of he lost his temper or just saying he lost his temper, would have produced the same effect with the airlines, whether the airlines, even if he had said, well, he lost his temper, he's been fired from his job, he may have a -- he may have a gun, whether that alone, without saying he was mentally unstable, would have induced the airline to take him off the flight. There are two different guestions. Materiality for defamation is -- is guite different from the materiality for purposes of obtaining the immunity under this Act. The latter guestion is for the court, but the former is for the jury, it seems to me.   You'd give the jury two different instructions? You are to find materiality for purposes of whether it's defamatory or not and then, having found that it is defamatory, you must make a second materiality finding, namely, would this defamatory statement have caused TSA -- if it had been accurate, would TSA not have taken the action that it did, not have removed this man from the flight? You're going to give the jury those two instructions on materiality?   And you'd -- you'd feel snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines, knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is going to be up to some jury who is going to see that this person, his career was ruined, and it's going to be up to the jury to say whether he can recover or not?   That doesn't give me a lot -- a lot of comfort. If you're really concerned about enabling people to come forward without fear, when they have a suspicion of something, I'm saying, well -- you know, some jury will decide whether -- whether you put it wrongly or not, and if you're putting it wrongly, it would have made a difference, it doesn't make me happy.
12-357 +++$+++        Isn't that what the word "extort" means?     You extort something from someone?     It means you get it from him, you don't get it from some third party.       Suppose -- suppose that the person coerced here was a -- was a corrupt person and had put his recommendation out for bids.     Okay?     He said, you know, I'll -- I'll recommend whoever pays me the most money.     Would that alter this case?       If -- if then somebody comes in and says, well, I'm not going to pay you the money, but I'll -- I'll break your knees if you don't recommend me, would that be extortion?
12-398 +++$+++        Well, I'm curious as to why the methodology of extracting the gene has not been patented.     You say everybody -- everybody uses it.     Why wasn't that patented?       But you still haven't answered her question.     Why?     Why would a company incur massive investment if it -- if it cannot patent?       You're still not answering the question.       Curiosity is your answer.       Yes.     But, of course, to profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do something with it afterwards.     So you really haven't given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the gene.       I mean, sure, yes, I can do stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else. What advantage do I get from being the person that or the company that isolated that -- that gene.     You say none at all.       Well, that's lovely.       Do you -- you've really lost me when you say that it's nature that does the alteration rather than the scientist.     I mean, whenever a scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by some force of nature.       I mean, he doesn't do it unnaturally, does he?     I mean, there's some -
12-399 +++$+++        Your -- your argument assumes that the phrase in the statute "to prevent the breakup of the Indian family" only applies where - where the father has custody.     I don't -- I don't know why that should be true.     If -- if that's what Congress meant, they could have put it much more narrowly.     They had a very broad phrase, "to prevent the break up of an Indian family."     And this guy is -- is the father of the child -       -- and they're taking the child away from him even though he wants it.       And that -- that is not the breakup of -- of an Indian family?       Oh, I see.     You're reading -- you're reading "Indian family" to mean something more than -- than a biological relationship, right?     You're going to hang a lot of -- a lot of other ornaments on that phrase?       I mean, it seems to me he's the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the - that's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and the kid.       He's the father.     He's the father.       This isn't State law.     This is a Federal statute which uses an expansive phrase, "the breakup of the Indian family."       Unless we believe that the Federal statute determines when he has parental rights by defining "parent" to include a biological father.       If that's the case, then what you said doesn't apply.       Yes, I wanted you to talk about (f).     Are you going to say something about that or -       -- are you going to leave it to the government?       You don't agree with the government's position, do you?       Please finish.     Let's finish.       That was its intent.       You don't think that that's what its intent was?       It only applies to children of -- to tribal children.     And -- and the purpose was to establish much more difficult standards for the adoption of -- of a child -       Now, maybe you -- you disagree with that policy, but that's clearly a policy behind the law.       It didn't say that.     It - its definition of -

12-416 +++$+++        Why -- why are payments not to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market? I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to allow the person challenging the patent to have exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular area. Does that violate the antitrust laws?       That -- that doesn't impress me.     What else?     What's your second point? (Laughter.)       In order to make money.     I mean, that's -- that's what it wants is money.       So instead of giving them a license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the whole thing, here's the money.     Go away.       Mr. Stewart, do you have a case in which the patentee, acting within the scope of the patent, has nonetheless been held liable under the antitrust laws --       -- for something that it's done acting within the scope of the patent?       This -- this was not a problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?       Yes, and so -- and so do suits against this kind of payment.     And I have -- I have the feeling that what happened is that Hatch-Waxman made a mistake.     It did not foresee that it would produce this kind of -- this kind of payment. And in order to rectify the mistake, the FTC comes in and brings in a new interpretation of antitrust law that did not exist before, just to make up for the mistake that Hatch-Waxman made, even though Congress has tried to cover its tracks in later amendments, right, which -- which deter these, these -- these payments.       So why should we overturn understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a mistake that Hatch-Waxman made?
12-417 +++$+++       I resent that. (Laughter.)      Tools and what?      Scabbards.      I lived in Chicago when it never got above zero for two weeks.      You don't want to say they are "wearing guns" in this case. (Laughter.)      And holding guns.      Yes.    But common usage doesn't separate from the meaning of clothes only those -- those protective garments that are required by the occupation, that are required by the employer. That's a -- that's a very strange definition of clothes. Hunters, when -- when they're hunting birds wear -- wear trousers that are brush-proof.    They, you know, resist briars and other things.    Those are protective.    And those -- those pants wouldn't be worn elsewhere. Now, I can understand you're arguing those are not clothes because they perform a protective function other than heat and cold.    But you're -- you're proposing a very odd definition of clothes.    It excludes only those protective garments that are protection against workplace hazards.    That's very strange.      No, but you have taken it on.    You're trying to tell us what is the ordinary meaning of clothes.    That's what you're appealing to, the ordinary meaning.      And I suggest the ordinary meaning is not -- is not what you -- you have proposed.      It includes protective garments, and -- and you want it to include all protective garments, I guess, except those that protect against workplace hazards.    That's peculiar.      Too complicated is why. (Laughter.)
12-418 +++$+++        I assume that applies to all Federal crimes, right?     Anyone convicted of any Federal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever civil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a good idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of crime from reoccurring, right?     I mean, nothing peculiar here about sex crimes.     Any -- any crime Congress can later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all sorts of different civil limitations.       No, no, that's not the point, that it's -- that it's retroactive.     The point is that it is not in execution of a Federal power.       That would be an execution of a Federal power --       -- the power -- the power to prevent that crime and to punish it.       But they have to be imposed simultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of which the individual has been convicted.     Here, the trial is over, the conviction is over, and then some years later the Federal government decides, oh, it would be a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes are -- are subjected to these limitations.     That's quite different from imposing that simultaneously as -- as a Page 9 punishment for the crime.     This is not a punishment for the crime, right?       Yes.       When you say in a civil proceeding, you mean?       So it's just by a preponderance of the evidence we think this guy probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime.       So just -- just more -- more likely than not is the test.       To -- to what does this civil -- civil-criminal line apply?     Suppose instead of a registration requirement, Congress just decided, you know, our past punishments for sex offenses have not been -- have not been severe enough, and so we are now going to impose a civil fine on all -- all persons who have been convicted in Federal court of sex crimes. It's a civil -- it's a civil penalty, not a criminal penalty.     That's okay?       I find that difficult to believe that --       -- that whether it's ex post facto and impermissible or not is simply eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling it civil.       I'm talking about the -- ex post facto.       Because it's civil.       I -- I find that difficult to grasp.       It -- it seems to me that when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the power to regulate the military.     You're relying on -- on some general Federal power to protect citizens against people who have committed any Federal crimes.     And I -- I don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution. Yes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your description, it has nothing to do with regulating the military.     It has to do with protecting the -- the public at large from people who have committed Federal Page 23 crimes, military or not.       That's right because it protects Federal functions.     The Federal -- the criminal applicability to the armed forces protects the function of regulating the armed forces.       But how does protecting the public at large from people who have committed a crime in the armed forces, how does that have anything to do with regulating the armed forces?       But that's not unusual. When you're released from the military, for example, you're no longer subject to -- to Congress's jurisdiction over the military.     That's a matter of Page 52 timing too, isn't it?       Not for something that they've done after they left the military.     That's a question of timing.     Had they left the military when they committed this crime? If so, they can't be prosecuted under -- under that power of the Federal government.       That's part of his sentence.     That's part of the punishment imposed.     You assert that this is not part of the punishment imposed.       Right.     Who knows what they'll do, right?
12-43 +++$+++        Excuse me.     Why -- why didn't -- why weren't they subject to a favorable regulatory regime in two, three, and four?
12-462 +++$+++    No. I think you have to conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a unilateral contract. It's not a promise in exchange for another promise. It's a promise in exchange for the performance of an act; that is, flying the airline -- you know, a certain number of miles. You're correct, it is a -- a unilateral contract. Now, whether that -- that means that there's no -- is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral contract?   Well, you -- you're not trying to enforce the contract anyway. You -- you want to get out of the contract. So you -- you ought to be happy to have it pronounced an illusory contract, right? What do you care?   Is that entirely -- I mean, suppose the contract said, "in its absolute discretion and subject to no obligation of good faith." Suppose it said that. Would State law still impose an obligation of good faith?   Well, it might well, or it would? I mean --   Well, this State, I mean, the State we're talking about.   Well, I suppose you could say that it is assumed that parties to a contract comport with community standards of fairness and decency -- you know, you can wiggle to there, if you want.   I don't want to have to sort those out State by State. I mean, it seems to me the -- the regime proposed by the Petitioner is -- is much more manageable. If it goes beyond the words of the contract, it -- and you're reading into it something that it doesn't say, it's a matter of State policy, so I can -- I can work with that. But you're -- you're asking me to go through each of the 50 States one-by-one to decide, oh, which -- which of these are really trying to discern the intent of the parties and which ones aren't, I -- especially since you discern the intent of the parties by simply saying, well, parties intend to apply community standards, right? And there'll be different community standards in every State, presumably. Some States are more honest than others, right?   There are variances, but not variances in such an ineffable guestion as to whether this is really an effort to discern the real intent of the parties or, rather, whether it's an intent to impose community standards, especially since, as I say, parties intend to adopt community standards, usually.
12-464 +++$+++        Well, I -- you know, I -- I find it hard to think that -- that the right of property is any more sacrosanct than the -- the right to freedom of the person, and we allow a grand jury indictment without -- without a separate mini-trial to justify the arrest and -- and holding of -- of the individual.     And if he -- if he doesn't have bail, he's permanently in jail until the trial is over.     And we allow all of that just on the basis of a grand jury indictment.     And you're telling us it's okay for that -- maybe you think it's not okay for that. But I think you're saying it's okay for that, but it's not okay for distraining his property. I -- I find it hard to -- to think that it's okay for the one and not okay for the other.       Ah, okay.     This is a bigger case than I thought. (Laughter.)       Is this only in the case where the person has no other assets, where all of his assets are seized, so that he can't -- he can't hire counsel?     Suppose only half of his assets are determined to -- or asserted by the government to have been the product of criminal activity, and he has a lot of other money with which he can hire an attorney.     Is that a different case?     And we're not -- that's not before us here.       So you have a hearing on whether he has other money, right?       Well, that's terrible.     We shouldn't allow that.     We shouldn't even hold the fellow.     We've been doing it for a thousand years, though, and it's hard to say that it violates what our concept of fundamental fairness is.       But a grand jury indictment doesn't -- doesn't establish that there is probable cause to believe that the person is a flight risk.     That doesn't contradict what the grand jury found.     You're asking the judge here to contradict what the grand jury found.       And in the next case we have, if we agree with you, will be somebody saying due process does not allow you to proceed with a trial when it has been found by an impartial judge that there is no probable cause.     That will be our next case, right?     And you may well argue it. To tell you the truth, I would prefer -- to save your client, I would prefer a rule that says you cannot, even with a grand jury indictment, prevent the defendant from using funds that are in his possession to hire counsel, don't need a hearing, just -- just it's unconstitutional for the rule to be any broader than withholding money that the defendant does not need to defend himself. Would you like that?     I really prefer it to yours.     I think yours leads us into really strange territory.       Does this hearing include an assessment of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees? I mean, if you're only withholding the amount of money necessary for the defense, what if this fellow wants to hire Clarence Darrow?     Does -- does that give him all the money?     How -- how do you decide that issue?       But does he know his lawyer -- is his lawyer there saying -- you know, this is the lawyer I'm going to hire and here's the fee I'm going to charge?       But you -- you acknowledge that that could be -- that could be an issue in the hearing in other cases.       I don't know what the fees are.     I don't even know who the lawyer's going to be. This defendant just comes in and says, I want to hire a lawyer.     And the court says -- you know, any particular lawyer?     No, I just want a lawyer.     The court's going to have to make up a fee, I assume, right?       Okay.     He has to choose a lawyer before this hearing, right?       Tell me something because I don't know the answer.     Can -- can the government track tainted funds that -- that have been given to other people, including lawyers?       I think they can, too.     So what happens if this lawyer gets his $500,000 and you've had the traceability hearings, so these are tainted funds?     If he is convicted, he gives the money back?       The -- the -
12-484 +++$+++        I can't understand you very well.     Could you -- maybe you have to lift up your mike, or maybe you have to speak more slowly.     But I'm having an awful time following you.
12-515 +++$+++    If we modified it to make an exception for commercial activities off reservation, could Congress reinstitute sovereign immunity if they wanted?   Maybe we've learned something in 15 years, such as the fact that -- (Laughter.)
12-5196 +++$+++    Excuse me. Will you crank up your -- your thing? I can't you hear well enough. That's good.
12-52 +++$+++        My question is -- is the same as Justice Breyer's.     It seems to me you are running in the wrong direction.     To the extent you say the case doesn't involve New Hampshire's towing law but involves just its general consumer protection law, it's -- it's even further distant from being preempted. I --       Now, you think that that general obligation under State law to pay a debt that you've contracted to pay is eliminated?       Why is that different from normal consumer protection law?     I -- I don't see that it's so much different.       It -- it includes storage, is the point you are coming to, right?       The definition includes storage.     You think it means -- it means storage at the end of the transportation?     Suppose you're -- you're a company that moves goods, but we also store goods.     You can -- you know, rent -- rent space and we will store your furniture for years.     If that company picks up some goods, brings it to its warehouse and leaves it in its warehouse for 3 years, that storage is covered by this -- by this statute, you think? See, I thought the storage was -- was storage in the course of the transportation.     Sometimes when you're -- you know, changing the mode of transportation, going from trucks to ships or something, you have to store it temporarily during -- during the course of the transportation.     That's how I would read it.     But you're saying, even if you're a storage company, if you pick up goods and bring it to the place where you store it, that's covered by -- by this statute.       Well, let me tell you how we -- it seems to me we've limited it in -- in the Columbus case, Columbus v. Harrah's Garage and Wrecker Services, Inc.     We said that, "The clause -- the clause's limitation to motor carrier services with respect to the transportation of property massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment motor carriers of property." And here you've told us that this case doesn't involve any law that singles them out for -- for special treatment.     To the contrary, it's the general consumer protection law.       So you want us to eat those words, they were wrong, or -- or somehow you don't come Page 20 within them?       So you say they were wrong, you say? (Laughter.)
12-536 +++$+++        I would think, if you named the PAC after a particular candidate, as the hypothetical assumes, I would be surprised if the Federal Election Commission wouldn't come after you for earmarking.       I can't imagine that if you have a PAC which says we're going to give money to Smith, that's bad, but if you have a PAC that says we're going to give all the money that you contribute to us to Smith and Jones, that's okay -- or Smith, Jones, and three others.     It seems to me that that's earmarking.       I assume that a law that only -- only prohibits the speech of 2 percent of the country is okay.       Oh, it isn't?       Ms. Murphy, do -- do we need a record to figure out issues of law?       I agree -- I agree that - that this campaign finance law is so intricate that I can't figure it out.     It might have been nice to have the -- you know, the lower court tell me what the law is.     But we don't normally require a record to decide questions of law.       Counsel, is it -- is it correct that the consequence of this provision has been very severe with respect to national political parties?       And -- and much of the money that used to go to them now goes to PACs; isn't that what has happened?       -- well, ordinarily, the national political parties will devote their money to elections in those States where the incumbent has a good chance of losing.     So, in fact, if you're an incumbent who cares about political parties, I don't want money to go to my opponents. And if you -- if you turn down the amount of money that the national political parties have, that's -- that much less money that can be devoted against you if you're challenged in a close race.     Isn't that the consequence of this?       What a surprise.       It's not that we're stopping people from spending big money on politics.       Wait.     That -- that -
12-547 +++$+++        200 years -- 200 years? Did you say that?       Well, I -       I -- I would have thought your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have thought your first response to -- to the question would have been to deny that you say it's clear because the supreme court of Michigan has said so.     I thought your argument is it's clear because it's clear.       It should have been your first point.     The premise is simply wrong.     You're saying it was clear because the statute's clear.       I think he contested that. I think he never went further into it, but he seemed to disagree with the proposition that, where there is a Michigan statute, it can't be supplemented by the common law.       You -- you rely on Reese as establishing the principle that you cannot supplement the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012 case.       I assume you'd need a case in which the prosecutor was pretty -- pretty clear that a diminished capacity defense would prevail.     Otherwise, it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel, right?       You want us to say, "yet again," when we write our opinion?
12-562 +++$+++        I was just going to ask, if the question were determined of whether the sham transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the basis, if that were determined at the partner level and not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to have different outcomes -       -- with respect to different partners?       And -- and you have to relitigate the same issue.       Excuse me.     Why would it vary from partner to partner?
12-574 +++$+++       Do you have any preference as to which of those errors you would like us to rely on?      Of course, the venue question does not -- does not bring into the Court a constitutional question and the jurisdictional -- the jurisdictional one does.      And we usually try to avoid constitutional questions.      It's the largest market for everything, isn't it?      Did the affidavit ever get to Nevada?      Ms. Sherry, you -- would you want us to decide this case on the jurisdictional question or the venue question?      I understand that.    That's why I asked the question. (Laughter.)      You say the affidavit wouldn't give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.
12-609 +++$+++        Of course, that would - that would be true, the last would be true, even if the defendant had not sought to introduce expert evidence of his own, right?       Of course, the issue is not whether the State can call its own expert.     The issue is whether the State can compel him to speak to its expert -       -- without which the expert can testify, right?       But sort of coming back to Justice Ginsburg's question, the Kansas Supreme Court held that the introduction of -- of the allegedly compelled testimony given to the -- to the psychiatrist violated the Federal Constitution.     But why didn't - why didn't the Kansas Supreme Court simply hold that there was no -- no right on the part of the prosecution to obtain that rebuttal evidence or to introduce it since this was a case of voluntary intoxication? You -- you tell me that Kansas does not allow this just for voluntary intoxication, and that was -- that was the defense he was raising, right?       That's what they did.     So when -- when we send it back, is it still open to them to decide that, under Kansas law, the testimony was not introducible?       And that is, as you say, a question of -- of Kansas law, so it would be odd for us to resolve that anyway.       I'm saying the question of whether the -- the cross-examination went beyond the scope of the direct and whether that invalidated it, that wouldn't be resolved under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but rather under Kansas law, right?       It seems to me -       Well, wait.     I mean, all the State -- I think it oversimplifies it to say that when -- when the defendant puts it at issue, the government can respond.     Yes, the government -- the government can respond with whatever evidence it has, but the issue here is not whether the government can respond. The issue is whether the government can compel the defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination.     That's -- that's quite a different issue really from whether the government can respond.     Of course it can respond.       More precisely, it's not that the State can have its own expert.     It's that the State can compel the defendant to testify to an expert -- can compel the defendant to speak to a psychiatrist.     That's really the issue, not -- not whether the government can respond.     Of course, it can respond.
12-62 +++$+++        Excuse me.     A mandatory schedule?       A mandatory schedule, you say?       Oh, okay.       It's not a change of the law if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to be imposed.     Your -- your case rests upon the proposition you stated at the outset, which is that the Ex Post Facto Law applies -- prohibition applies -- if there is a substantial possibility of -- of a higher sentence -- was that the language you used?       Significant risk. Suppose -- suppose the district judge for the Federal district in which somebody's crime was committed was a bleeding heart judge.     He always gave the lowest sentence possible, and everybody knew that. And he is replaced.     He retires after the arrest, after the crime, and he is replaced by Maximum John, who everybody knows gives the highest sentence, every time.     Ex post -- ex post facto violation?       What about the statutes allowing relatives and friends of the victim to testify? Let's assume a crime committed before -- a horrible crime committed before that statute is enacted.     Does it violate the ex post facto law to give effect to that statute?       Why?     Don't -- don't you think it creates a significant risk --       -- that the defendant will get a higher sentence?     Don't you think that's the whole object of the law, in fact?       Is that -- is that what -- who says that they're the benchmark that you start with? Where -- where is that writ?       A court -- a court must begin with that?       Your -- your case depends, it seems to me, upon the proposition that significant risk is only applicable at the sentencing stage.     And I'm not sure that that's true.     I mean, what -- why -- why would that be so? What if -- what if you have a new law that permits evidence to come in, in a criminal trial, that previously was not allowed to come in?     Let's say the testimony of a wife or -- or whatever.     I think the law is pretty well established that that change in procedure does not violate the ex post facto law. And -- and your response to that is, well, that's not sentencing; it's trial.     So what?     I mean, if -- certainly making a conviction more likely is -- is even worse than making a higher sentence more likely.       But saying that the sentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or from relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in sentencing law is okay?       It pertains to sentencing. It -- it says what the sentencing authority, the judge or the jury, must consider.       This is evidence brought before the sentencer.       I don't see any difference between that and saying that the -- the guidelines have to be considered by the sentencer.       Does it "affix a higher punishment," in the words of Calder v. Bull?       I don't think that's a question at all.     The answer to that is quite easy.     It does not affix a higher punishment, does it?       Okay.     Then rely on Garner, but not on Calder v. Bull.       That doesn't help -- (Laughter.)
12-682 +++$+++ 
12-696 +++$+++       We should -- we should -      We should assume -- to, to make it parallel to what occurred here that the next day before the same committee a Muslim would lead the invocation and the day after that an orthodox Jew.    I mean -      -- it makes a difference whether it's just one -- one denomination that is being used as -- as chaplain or open to various denominations.      But you -- but you -- you had no problem, Mr. Hungar, with the marshal's announcement at the -- at the beginning of this session. God save the United States and this Honorable Court. There -- there are many people who don't believe in God.      So that's okay?      Why -- why is that okay?      I don't really understand your -- your answer.    How can it be that if the practice existed in the past, it was constitutional?    Was it constitutional in the past?      If it was constitutional in the past, why -- why would it be unconstitutional if the same thing is done today, even without any past parallel practice.    That's a nice alliteration.    Is past parallel practice essential?      Mr. Hungar, what -- what is the equivalent of prayer for somebody who is not religious?      What would somebody who is not religious -      -- what is the equivalent of prayer?      From what?      I suppose a moment -      You agree that coercion is the test, however?      If it is the test -
12-71 +++$+++        So that form should have included the eligibility requirements that your State demands.     And it seems to me your complaint is that the Federal form does not require proof of citizenship, unless you consider just the statement that I'm a Page 9 citizen to be proof of citizenship. But why didn't you challenge the form?     I mean, that's -- that's my problem with this.     I frankly think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting. And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal of the Commission to include on the form, as additional State requirements, the proof of citizenship?       Sure.     Sure.       Well, you're -- you're simply denying then that the Federal government can, so long as it protects the requirements that your State imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter Page 10 registration.       Why -- why can't it make it exclusive?     Let's assume -- I think -- I think that -- that accept and -- and employ, whatever the language is --       -- suppose -- suppose I think that that does mean that it's supposed to be exclusive.     What harm is there so long as the Federal Commission requires, as part of the Federal form, all of the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the State imposes?       And you did nothing more about that?       You -- you didn't go to court to say you have to include this as one of the State-specific requirements. Why didn't you do that?       Oh.     Okay. Why didn't he do it? Page 12 (Laughter.)       How could you establish citizenship without having something mailed in, in addition to the form?     What are the other State-specific requirements?     You have to put down your driver's license number or some other numbers?     I -- I guess you could -- you could make them check off place of birth and if that place of birth is not the United States, you could require them to write down some number of -- of Page 15 their admission to citizenship.     Are there -- are there numbers that you could demand?       Okay.       Right.       Yes, that's the kind of thing you should have had and that your predecessor Page 16 should have asked for to be included in the Federal form.       Well, I don't think they're driving the bus as to the form.     They can't drive it into a ditch.     They're -- they're -- they're subject to arbitrary and capricious limitations, just as any other agency is.     And to allow Louisiana -- to include what -- what they've allowed a Louisiana to include and to say that the only proof of citizenship -- there is a Page 17 provision in the statute which says consistent with determining, the States being able to determine the qualifications. Isn't there a provision which makes it clear that the Federal form has to make allowance for the States determining the qualifications?       Now --       That's true.       But the form has to enable the State to do that.     And it seems to me you were quite able to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen, right?     So it's under oath.     Big deal.     If -- if -- if you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you're willing to violate the perjury laws.       So I think you should -- you should have challenged the commission's refusal to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.       Gee, if I believed -- if I believed in legislative history, I would find that very persuasive. (Laughter.) Page 22
12-729 +++$+++        Well, you know, I guess there are answers to these -- to these legal questions, whether it's the first filing or if supplemental documents are required, it's the second filing.     There's an answer, you know?     Some court will provide the answer. The mere fact that -- that provisions in a contract are subject to various interpretations doesn't make the provision invalid.     It means something.     We just don't know right now what it means until -- until a court provides the answer.     But, wow, that's not different from any contract.       But it hasn't undermined the framework.     I mean, Petitioner had a year.     I mean, I can understand if -- a finding that a particular case is -- is not filed too late when indeed there was - there was no time to do it.     But here they -- they had a year.     Why -- why does that undermine the framework?     If and when they don't have enough time, the court can say the -- this suit is not precluded.       So what?       Counsel -       Well, that's -- that's the internal claims.     Do you know any other instance in which -- when a suit can be brought in -- in Federal court will be determined by an agency?       An agency saying you've got to sue within 1 year, you've got to sue within 6 years. Offhand, I can't think of any, and -- and I think it goes well beyond what -- what the Executive is authorized to prescribe.       You know any other instances where -- where a Federal agency has, in effect, prescribed the running of the statute for the courts?     Maybe there are some, but I don't know of any.
12-751 +++$+++    Section 1104 of ERISA, which this -- this plan is not exempted from, says that the fiduciaries must manage a plan, and I guote, "for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries." Do you acknowledge that that's binding on the --   Well, I don't add that. I'm just saying providing benefits. I mean, that's -- that's --   -- that's guite different from running a plan to -- to own stock in the company. That's -- that's not the basic purpose of it.   You say the benefits referred to in the -- providing benefits to participants, and you're saying the benefits to participants is their ownership of company stock, including worthless company stock.   But when it ceases to be valuable, it seems to me you're not.   Well, the participants   Why do you need a special rule for -- for ESOPs? I mean, the -- the factors that you mentioned, it seems to me, apply to any trustee who's managing. You say, oh, you should have sold because the stock was overvalued on the -- on the stock market. Well, how is the trustee supposed to know that?   Is he going to outguess the market?   Surely you don't demand that a prudent trustee outguess the market. Okay? So if it's not the market that's overvalued, it must be inside knowledge --   -- that causes him to know.   And you have the same problem about not being able to use that inside knowledge.   So -- so why do we need a special rule for ESOPs I'm saying? All the points you make apply to any -- any kind of trustee, whether it's only company stock or not. Why do we need a special rule for -- for company stock operations?   Right.   Right.   No. But you have the same -- the same -- the same problems that -- that you justify doing nothing for the ESOP, justifies doing nothing in the other -- in the other plans; namely, you can't expect me to -- to outsmart the market, number one, nor can you expect me to use my inside knowledge. That violates the securities laws. So those are your two points, but it seems to me those points apply. We don't have to adopt a special law for this.
12-7515 +++$+++       But each one is the third person.    I mean, each one of them is the third person. It seems to me each one is a but-for cause.    And I don't know why you don't say there's but-for causation there.      As I understand -- as I understood the evidence in this case, the experts testified they could not say that he would not have died but for the cocaine.      That's quite different from this case where what is put to you is he -- you could say he would not have died but for the drop that each one of them put in.      So why isn't that but-for causation?      I don't care if it's a form of but-for causation.    It's but-for causation.      I think "foreseeability" is the wrong word.    I don't think, you know, in tort law we -- we use the word "foreseeability" for Palsgraf. It's a matter of scope of the risk.    It may not be foreseeable.    It may be an unusual situation that will cause it, but it's within the scope of the risk.    And when you sell drugs, you know that one of the things that can happen is that the drugs will produce an overdose. I'm not sure -- I wouldn't call it foreseeability.    I would call it scope of the risk.      What is substantial factor? I mean, I don't follow you.    I don't see how it gets you to where you want to be unless "substantial factor" means that it would have been a but-for cause.      Right.      It's a strange terminology for it.    I mean, they really ought to get another terminology if that's what they mean.      You can be a substantial factor without being independently sufficient.      Marginally.      Well, for -- for any crime, there are two things.    We punish the intent, the wickedness, and in both cases, the party is equally wicked, but we also punish the consequence.    In one case, the party dies because of that person's act.    And in the other case, nobody dies just because of that person's act.    I don't know why you have to run away from that. It's -- it's common in the criminal law that -- that two acts that are equally unlawful, equally nefarious, one happens to kill somebody, the other one doesn't.    We punish one person, we don't punish the other.      And I would say, my goodness, if only 1 percent overdose, that -- that isn't very foreseeable.    I -- you know, I don't think you have to submit that to the jury.    I think that's one of the reasons we -- we banned these drugs, because they are risky, and anybody should know that if somebody dies from it, it's within the scope of the risk when you sold the cocaine. Now, I guess it's different if you're selling, I don't know, sleeping pills, okay?    Which are part of a cocktail that -- that causes somebody to die. That's the situation that worries me.    It seems to me if the cocaine -- the person selling the cocaine can be liable for the cocktail death, I guess the person who sold the sleeping pills could, as well.      But it's just up to the jury to decide whether it was foreseeable or not.      And you cannot say, as I - as I think I say, that if you sell cocaine and if it is without a doubt the but-for cause of somebody's death, you're liable under this statute.    You don't think that's the case.

12-786 +++$+++    I don't understand what you're saying. You're saying that you can avoid the problem if the patent is drawn in such a way as what, to -- to require a single person to do all the steps?   How does that give you any more protection? I mean, you can still violate the patent by not having one person do all the steps; have another person do some of the steps. And -- and -- it's -- it's just as effective in -- in -- in stealing the idea and yet there would not be a violation of the patent.   Yes. Then, of course. But we're not talking about agents. We're talking about somebody who simply cooperates with you. He's not your agent.   Yes. I agree with you. I mean, I'm not -- I'm not arguing about that. I'm just -- I'm just arguing about whether the -- the safe haven you have given us for -- for patentees really exists. It doesn't seem to me you can avoid the problem by simply requiring all the steps to be conducted by -- by one person.   You say this isn't here anyway, right?   Okay. And 11 of the 12 judges on the Federal Circuit agreed with your position on the thing, I gather, or something like that.   Okay. So how many out of -- out of how many? Maybe -- maybe that's why we didn't grant the cross-petition.   Is she talking about (b) or (a)? I thought the question went to (a). And you're answering (b).   Maybe I'm wrong.   Yes, but that is not the tort rule for what this is, which is an absolute liability. I mean, you asked for the policy reason. The policy reason is someone who does not even know about the existence of the -- of the patent, who happens to be one of the people who -- who performs one or more of the -- of the steps is suddenly automatically liable. That's -- that's the policy reason. It's a strict liability tort.   Well, even knownst -- even knownst to each other, but -- but one of them who is knownst doesn't know about the patent. He would still be liable, wouldn't he?   And also avoiding the text of the statute. (Laughter.)
12-79 +++$+++        If they were covered securities, right?     I mean, you're -- you're pledging covered securities to the bank and make a misrepresentation about them, right?       I had assumed that the purpose of the securities laws was to protect the purchasers and sellers of the covered securities.     There is no purchaser or cover -- or seller of a covered security involved here.       It's -- it's a purchaser of not -- not-covered securities who is being defrauded, if anyone.     Why -- why would the Federal securities law protect that person?       It doesn't have to be the plaintiff's, but it has to be somebody's.       Nonexistent purchases, right?       Anyway, Line's not a case of ours, is it?       It's not a case of any court, is it?       It's one of your cases.       Right.     We don't have to agree with all of your cases, do we? (Laughter.)       What -- what troubles me, Ms. Goldenberg, is not the problem of our figuring out these economic consequences, but the text of the statute, which says, "in connection with the purchase or sale of one of the covered securities."  or sale here. Yes, Your Honor. There has been no purchase  It can't be in connection with a purchase or sale that has never occurred.     I mean, it could be have read in connection with the purchase or sale or the promised purchase or sale or the contemplated purchase or sale, but it doesn't.     It says, "in connection with the purchase or sale." I don't know how you can make that stick to a situation where there has been no purchase or sale.
12-794 +++$+++    Under Federal law, you don't think the judge could say, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this defendant has already pleaded guilty to a horrible crime. This is a punishment hearing. He has chosen not to -- not to testify in this -- in this hearing. You -- you are -- if you wish, you may take his failure to testify as an indication that he does not have remorse, that he is not sorry. He could have come before you said and, said I am terribly sorry, I wish I had never done it, I will never do it again. He has chosen not to testify. You may, if you wish, take that into account in determining whether -- whether there is remorse. You can't say that.   Well, then, your answer should have been otherwise.   Of course.   In this case, of course, the question is even narrower. That instruction would forbid the jury from even taking into account his failure to testify on -- on the one factor of remorse -- the one psychological factor of remorse. And if you say that you're not entitled to such an instruction on that, that alone would have -- would have been enough to deny the requested instruction.   They also weren't instructed to draw any inferences, were they?   I mean, the -- the issue here is whether you must instruct them not to draw inferences, not -- not whether -- whether -- anyway.
12-815 +++$+++ 
12-820 +++$+++    Where is it in the materials?   Article 13, which you're referring to.   I'd like to read it.   Well, which of the articles -- which of the provisions in Article 13 would -- would prevent the return in the hypothetical that Justice Alito just gave you?   I mean, what -- what does Article 13 allow the court to consider? It says, "It's not bound to order the return if the person, institution, or other body having care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention." Well, you know --   That wouldn't have -- or had consent to or -- that wouldn't apply in his hypothetical or in this case.   B, "There is grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm." I mean, we have no reason to believe that -- that your client would -- would harm the child or -- or that the parent in Justice Alito's hypothetical would harm the child, "or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." I don't see how any of those things would -- would come to the assistance of the child in -- in Justice Alito's hypothetical.   Physical or psychological harm.   It might be now and then, but in the routine case that Justice Alito just gave you, I don't see how there's any -- any reason at all not to yank the child back from wherever he's been for 10 years.   Yes, but Article 13 does not say the child -- the child can state -- well, let's see. "The child objects to being returned." I guess you could limit to that. "May also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned."   So that's the one exception, yes.   But they may be wrong. Who cares if they're wrong? The point is a treaty should be interpreted uniformly by all the parties to it. And you're telling me, well, all the rest of them interpret it another way, but they're wrong -- you know, everybody is out of step, but me. That's -- that's just not right.   None of that is covered by the treaty. Yes, each State may apply its own law with respect to matters not covered by the treaty, but I do not read that to say -- to mean that each State may apply its own law in interpreting the provisions of the treaty and so can create exceptions on the basis of equitable discretion when the treaty has none or because its courts use that in another -- in other contexts or create an exception on the basis of equitable tolling. This is a matter of interpreting the treaty, not of bringing into effect some other principle of -- of State law that overrides the treaty. That's how I read that provision.
12-842 +++$+++    In an ordinary State case, let's say, you get a judgment in -- in New York, and the judgment is -- is not satisfied. And so there is this kind of an inguiry into what property the -- the losing defendant owns. Cannot you find out what property that defendant owns in Florida?   But the New York court has -- its writ does not run to Florida.   You have to bring another -- another lawsuit in Florida, right? And so also here, the writ -- the writ of the Second Circuit doesn't run to -- to France. You may have to bring a separate suit in France. But -- but I don't -- I don't see that it goes beyond the bounds of what the -- of what the law allows the discovery to -- to cover.   But that's absolutely not true because a New York court cannot order execution on property in Florida. You have to bring another -- another cause of action in Florida. And yet, you certainly can find out what -- what property the deadbeat defendant owns in Florida.   Do you -- do you contend that you cannot levy upon commercial property in foreign countries where those countries have the same kind of Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act as we do? When you get a judgment in New York, can you take that judgment and levy upon commercial property of Argentina in France?   Of course.   So you are entitled to find out what -- what property Argentina has in France. And your only complaint is you shouldn't be able to find out what -- what non -- what -- what property that is not subject to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is in France, right?   No, no. But you acknowledge that -- that you can levy on property in France. You can take your New York judgment, go to France and so long as the property is commercial property and France has the same, which it does, the same modern rule that sovereign immunity does not extend to commercial property, you can -- you can satisfy your judgment in France.   Of course. But that doesn't mean you can't find out and go to France and roll the dice in France, right?   You're -- you're saying you can't even play the game.   I can't understand this. You acknowledge that you can go after property in France, but you assert you are not entitled to find out what property Argentina has in France.   No, wait, wait.   I found it extraordinary that we did not have -- I think this is correct -- a single brief from foreign countries. They file all the time when there is a case before us that they think trenches upon their prerogatives. Not a single foreign country, maybe because Argentina owes them money as well as it does these plaintiffs.   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I thought that the whole purpose of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was to protect us from you, from the State Department and the government coming in and saying, Oh, you know, in this case, grant this one, deny that one. I thought the whole purpose of the FSIA was to enable us to look at the case and decide it on the basis of the statute.   But now you're coming in and saying, Oh, there are principles behind the statute that we have to apply that extend -- extend the words of the statute beyond what they say, and they say nothing about -- about finding out the assets of people abroad.   What provision of the statute controls here?   So you think the discovery is certainly okay with respect to those commercial interests on which the plaintiffs can execute?   So this thing is a little too broad.   Well, why do you -- I'm sorry.   Why haven't foreign countries protested? Why aren't they here as amici? Is there a single foreign state that has taken your position?   Why haven't they told us? They have to ask you to pass it along?   They file amicus briefs all the time and if this is as horrific as you are painting it, we would have had some briefs from them.

She has to know each individual, or she can't be covered?   The woman has undergone serious psychiatric harm because of her knowledge that there are thousands of people out there viewing her rape, but you say she can't -- why isn't your client at least responsible for some of that? Even without her knowing him, he had two of her pictures. He's one of the thousands of people who viewed -- who viewed her rape. So why can't she recover some amount from him? I mean, the other side says she ought to be able to recover everything from him. You say she ought to be able to recover nothing. What about something in-between? What -- what about figuring out how much of -- of her total psychiatric damage and all the expenses and what-not are attributable to this particular person?   You said that for another question.   Give me one facet. (Laughter.)
12-872 +++$+++        Well, if you're correct that the two are one and the same, how -- how is it that we have authorized district courts to do the one or the other? We -- we have not required district courts to reach the merits if they're -- if they can resolve the question on -- on the basis of qualified immunity alone.     Well, how can that be, if the merits are necessarily part of the qualified immunity determination?       Maybe -- well, maybe you better say a few words about the merits?
12-873 +++$+++    The Lanham Act goes well beyond the common law, doesn't it?   Okay. But that would be a lot stronger if -- if you said the Lanham Act merely, as the Sherman Act was supposed to have done, merely adopted the common law. The Lanham Act doesn't merely adopt the common law. It goes well beyond it.   It doesn't mention what at all? It doesn't   But proximate cause? What about proximate cause? Do you agree that -- that there's no proximate cause analysis when what is at issue is an injunction?   Answer my guestion. Yes or no? Do you agree with what Justice Sotomayor said --   Because --   What is prudential standing? I don't really understand. Is -- is it anything other than -- should it be renamed statutory standing? It can always be done away with by Congress, right?   And -- and is it -- is it the kind of standing that we would have to raise on our own? Is it jurisdictional, so that if -- if a party hasn't raised it below, it, nonetheless, is still unavailable argument on appeal? Is prudential standing of that sort?   I'm uncomfortable with the notion that -- you know, in my prudence I give standing here and I deny standing there, it's just up to me. I can understand Article III. But unless prudential standing means statutory standing, so that I look to the statute to see whom it was intended to empower to bring lawsuits, I am very uncomfortable with the whole notion.
12-895 +++$+++       You do not agree, then, that if you know that there's -- that there's a bank robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're -- you're the wheelman, and you also know that the -- you know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal liability for the firearms unless you intended them to use the firearms; is that your position?      No, no.      Now, wait.    It would support a verdict -- you're saying it would support a finding of -- of intent.      Let's assume there's a lot of evidence that he didn't really want them to use firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended them to use, but he knew that they had firearms.      No.    No, no, you can't. It's my hypothetical.    And you cannot conclude from that.    There is so much other evidence.    This -- this man hates firearms.    He does not like firearms.    There is no way he could have intended them to use firearms. But he knew they had firearms.      Facilitate the crime.      So you don't have to -- you don't have to -      Okay.    So if you intend a crime -- if you intend a crime and you know that the crime is being conducted with firearms, that's enough.      Beforehand.    Before -- you know beforehand that the crime is going to be perpetrated with firearms.    That's all you do.    You know beforehand, and you facilitate the crime.      I don't think it's ever harmless error to not instruct the jury -- or to instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the crime.    If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me he has to instruct the jury to find intent.    It's not up to the court to say, well, there surely was intent anyway so it's harmless error.    The jury has to find intent.      I'm surprised to hear you say that you don't need prior knowledge.    I think you need prior knowledge.      Yes.      After you know.      Did -- did he facilitate the crime after the shots were fired?      Well, but the crime of conviction was -- was a drug offense with the use of a firearm, right?      And so I thought -- I thought that the law is pretty clear that if you -- if you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate each element of that offense, so long as you have knowledge that that element existed.      But -- but more precisely, they could be asked did he facilitate the drug deal knowing that a firearm was going to be used in the drug deal.    Would that satisfy you?      I don't understand what your position is.    He has to use the gun himself?      But only -- you say it's enough to go to the jury and what you would ask the jury to find is intent, right?      Not just to find those facts that were stated by Justice Kennedy.      In addition, the jury would have to find intent.      Okay.
12-9012 +++$+++    Is that all we're talking -- you know, if I were arguing your side of the case, I would -- I would not say that the bank got defrauded of money. Your client never got the money. The money had to be spent in order to buy the property. What the fraud here consisted of is that the bank got a -- a loan, a mortgage, an interest in property, assured by a less-than-solvent debtor when it expected to get an interest in property assured by a solvent debtor. And it's -- why isn't the nature of the fraud precisely the mortgage? This is not as good a mortgage as the bank anticipated it was getting. And therefore, you don't have to -- it is indeed the very same property. They -- they gave them back the -- the real estate, but it was not as much as -- as they had expected.   -- do not come under B. I thought that was your case. Under B, you can deduct the value as of -- as of the date the property is returned, of any part of the property that is returned.   The baseball bat is not a return of part of the property that was stolen.   Nor is the cartload of rotten tomatoes.   So what are we talking about here? (Laughter.)   Why didn't you say that? You were quibbling about when it should be valued. You should have said it doesn't come under B at all.   Not if it doesn't come into the statute at all.   What if I don't think that the -- that the mortgage has anything to do with returning property, that a mortgage -- the real estate is not cash. Okay? What if I think it doesn't come under B at all? How would it be treated if it doesn't come under B?   Cash hasn't been returned. I mean, you could say the same thing about the baseball bat. He gives him a baseball bat. It had nothing to do with the cash that he got, and -- and you would say, well, when he sells the baseball bat, he gets cash, therefore cash has been returned. That's surely not right, is it?   It's the same with the baseball bat, right?
12-929 +++$+++        Could -- could I ask, what difference would it make to you if -- if I thought the venue here is proper, but I thought that there -- there was no cause of action in this circuit, and the case - as one of the amicus briefs proposed.     What difference would that make to you?       Excuse me.     But what if there is no personal jurisdiction, okay, and the -- and the suit is dismissed because there is no personal jurisdiction.     Would a Federal court transfer it to - to another court that has personal jurisdiction?       But why is that?     Why wouldn't 1404(a) continue to apply?       If -- but it depends upon -- upon the defendant.     If he chooses to go the 1404(a) route, he could go that way, couldn't he?       He wouldn't have to move under 12(b)(6), would he?

12-9490 +++$+++    Throwing bombs doesn't count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it? Were they throwing bombs that they weren't carrying?   And it was illegal.   It was illegal.   I'm  I'm not sure he gets an A for consistency. I thought -- I thought you said you acknowledged or didn't repudiate the statement in -- in our opinion in J.L., that, if there was a bomb in the car, that would be something else. What -- what if there's in the car -- the tip is this person has an atomic bomb given him by Al Qaeda; he is driving it into the center of Los Angeles to -- to eradicate the entire city, okay? Let it go?   He tells you the license number, where the car is. You can't stop the car?   So you see, he's not consistent. I mean --   It seems to me you're willing to accept our allowing -- or allowing the police to stop the car with the atom bomb and even allowing the police to stop the car with the kidnapped girl in the trunk. Once -- you know, once you give away those, we're just arguing about details, where you draw the line. Does -- does drunken driving fall on one side or the other of the line, and some of us may think drunken driving is -- is pretty serious and probably -- you know, as serious as having a kidnapped girl in the trunk.   Okay. More than that, I want you to say the Court shouldn't. Let the car go. Bye-bye, Los Angeles.   And I assume you would you would also say, to tie it into Justice Breyer's question, you would also say that that tip, "Somebody ran me off the road," would not justify the court -- the police in stopping the car, just to make sure that this car was not the one that drove the guy off the road, right?   Never mind drunkenness. The tip doesn't say anything about drunkenness. It just said, this car drove me off the road. You'd say the police could not follow that car, pull him over, and -- and ask did you -- did you drive somebody off the road?   Following the car is going to do them no good as to whether he drove -- drove somebody off the road. They're not looking for a drunk. They're looking for somebody who drove somebody off the road, right?   They could if the guy admitted it, you know.   They could play Mutt and Jeff with him and he -- oh, yeah, I did, yes.   What about drawing the line at intentional conduct? The guy who has a bomb is going to use it. He's intentionally going to use it.   Or maybe intentionally doing an action that is going to harm more than one person, as opposed to, hmm, maybe this person might accidentally, because he's inub-- inebriated, hurt somebody? It seems to me there's a clear line between somebody who's -- who's bent on an intentional crime and somebody who might harm somebody because of his conduct. You like that one?
12-96 +++$+++        I was about to ask a similar question.     If someone is acquitted of a Federal crime, would it -- would the prosecution be able to say, well, okay, he didn't commit this crime, but Congress could have enacted a different statute which he would have violated in this case.     Of course, you wouldn't listen to that, would you?       Indeed, Congress must have found that the situation was even clearer and the violations even more evident than originally because, originally, the vote in the Senate, for example, was something like 79 to 18, and in the 2006 extension, it was 98 to nothing.     It must have been even clearer in that these States were violating the Constitution. Do you think that's true?       Or decided that perhaps they'd better not vote against it, that there's nothing, that there's no -- none of their interests in voting against it.       I thought -- I thought the same thing.     I thought it's sort of extraordinary to say Congress can just pick out, we want to hit these eight States, it doesn't matter what formula we use; so long as we want to hit these eight States, that's good enough and that makes it constitutional.     I doubt that that's true.       And it happens not to be the method that Congress selected.       If they selected that, you could say they used a rationale that works.     But just because they picked some other rationale, which happens to produce this result, doesn't seem to me very persuasive.       That's a good answer.     I was hoping you would say that.
12-98 +++$+++        They must allocate?     Is the State saying, You do not own that 30 percent of the recovery, so you never get a property right in it, so that there's never any problem about asserting a lien against it?     I thought that's what's going on here.     And I think that's sort of disguised by talking about allocation. I thought the State is saying, as to percent of the recovery, you have no property right in it.     Is it not saying that?     Am I wrong?       Maybe -- maybe you didn't hear my -- my question.     My question is:     Is the State saying that you have no property right in the 30 percent?       Let me ask my question again.     Is the State saying that you have no property right in the 30 percent?     I think that can be answered "yes" or "no."       You can bind the parties for other purposes, I assume.     There are other purposes for which the distinction between pain and suffering and medical expenses might make a difference, right? What -- what if the parties agreed that it's 50/50?     Would the State take 50 percent then, or is the State still limited to 30?       Okay.       Don't you think the statute may -- may give you the answer?     It says:     "Any attorney retained by the beneficiary shall out of the proceeds obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third party by reason of injury or death distribute to the department the amount of assistance paid by the department on behalf of...up to 33 percent."     It applies to judgments as well as to settlements.       Why?     I don't understand that.     You see, I think the only way you can defend it is that -- is that the recipient never -- never had a property right.     Once -- once recovery is given to the recipient, the recovery does not belong to the recipient.     And if that's true for 33 percent, it can be through -- true for 100 percent. Has there ever been any litigation since about takings problems, with -- with the State requiring 33 percent to go to the medical provider, even though it may well be that -- that less or more of that amount went to medical damages --
12-99 +++$+++       What -- what about support of the legislation to permit slot machines?    Was that a promise that the union made?      But as the case comes to us, we assume that there was such a commitment by the union.      Okay.      Well, there would have been a quid pro quo for that, certainly.    I mean, the union wouldn't promise that for nothing.    It would get something in exchange such as, as in this case, the right to go on the employer's property to -- to recruit union members or -- or some other thing of value from the employer, right?      Mr. MCCracken, the Respondent's brief here asserts that these kinds of precertification agreements have only been common since the -- the '90s.    Is that accurate to you?      And he's a big guy. (Laughter.)      What about slot machines? You -- you mentioned all of the other things promised, but not -- not the promise to support legislation.
12-992 +++$+++    It would be a strange -- strange thing to worry about, it seems to me. It's a fairly infrequent situation, isn't it?
13-115 +++$+++    Counsel, I don't understand the government to be making the argument, and I can't understand why it isn't making the argument, that it doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress anti-Bush demonstrations, that in this area, as in traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent. If -- if a policeman stops somebody, and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming back from an anti-Bush demonstration, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't listen to that argument. We'd say, did you have a broken taillight or not? If you had a broken taillight, we do not inguire into the subjective intent of the officer. Why is it any different here?   You haven't made it.   You don't even have to get into that. You don't have to get into clearly established law. It's a very simple case. If you say, was there objectively a reason to move these people? If there was, if you had an ulterior motive that was unconstitutional, we don't inguire into it.   I don't -- what does that answer mean?   I can't understand why you didn't brief it then in that case. I cannot understand why you didn't brief it. And -- and talking about things that we haven't -- haven't held in the past, we haven't even held in the past that -- that there is a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation, have we?   Do we have any cases that has held that?   That's not a mixed motive. Why -- why do you accept the description of that as a mixed motive case?   If you agreed with my hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the officer's motive was. It does not matter. If there's an objective basis for a traffic stop, even if his sole motive was discriminatory, the stop is nonetheless valid. This is not a mixed motive issue.   Then don't -- just don't call it mixed motive. It confuses everything. It confuses everything.   You know, I really  I really don't understand what the government is doing here. It seems to me you want to win this case, but not too big. (Laughter.)   In -- in light of the arguments waived below and the arguments not made here, you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest possible ground. I would think it is in the interest of the United States and the Secret Service to say there are no Bivens First Amendment actions, but you don't make that argument. Didn't make it below; don't make it here. Likewise, it would be in their interest to say, oh, this is just like a traffic stop. It doesn't matter whether we had a -- a bad motive so long as there was an objective reason, that's the end, but you don't make that argument here either. I -- I really can't understand what the government is trying to do here.
13-132 +++$+++    Did it say instrumentalities or evidence? Which did it say?   Because Justice Alito said evidence. You -- you changed it to instrumentality. Is one of you wrong?   Well, I thought you say that's very -- you've told us that that's -- that's hard to figure out, what you can and what you can't. But it's easy for a magistrate, but -- but impossible for a -- for an arresting officer?   Well, but --   I don't understand your first exigent circumstances. When there is a bomb, but you can't -- you don't know whether there's a bomb until you look in the phone. Whether -- whether his associates are on the way to, you know, to kill the officer and -- and release their confederate, you don't know until you look into the phone. So how -- you know, how can that possibly be an exigent circumstance?   It seems to me it would almost never -- you would never be able to say, you know, surrounding circumstances give me reason to suspect that there's a bomb in the phone.   Give me reason to suspect that his confederates are on the way.   Excuse me. A warrant for what? A warrant for examining the phone?   For somebody's arrest. Well, how does that extend to your ability to answer his phone?
13-193 +++$+++    You're -- you're not asking us to resolve the constitutional guestion, just the guestion of whether you can raise the Constitution.
13-298 +++$+++    Why isn't it -- why isn't doing it through a computer not enough? I mean, was the cotton gin not an invention because it just means you're doing through a machine what people used to do by hand? It's not an invention. It's the same old, same old.   Why -- why is a computer any different in that respect?   Well, I'm not saying use a computer is -- is much of a novelty. I mean, that's -- that goes to whether it's novel or not. If you just say use a computer, you haven't invented anything. But if you come up with a serious program that -- that does it, then, you know, that may be novel. But that's a novelty issue, isn't it?   And four is not five anyway, right?   Four is not five.   By the way, we -- we have said that you can't take an abstract idea and then say use a computer to implement it. But we haven't said that you can't take an abstract idea and then say here is how you use a computer to implement it --   -- which is basically what you're doing.   And that's a little different.
13-299 +++$+++    Could you be more specific? What are the particular aspects of other accounts that you think would not qualify?
13-301 +++$+++    As you say, the Respondent concedes all that. So why don't -- why don't you talk about what the difference is between you and the Respondent? Nobody defends what the lower court said here, right?   Is -- is there really a difference between those two? Can it be plausible if there is -- if there is no evidence that suggests that it's true?   It may well be that the two of you agree in other words, depending on what they think.   That's a point -- that's a point for argument. I mean, you can argue that to the -- to the district court.   You don't want us to resolve that here.   What -- what do you mean about a problem? I mean, some of them are applying a requirement of a strong inference and others are applying a requirement of a weak inference. How is that a problem? I mean, you could say no problem, they're just doing what they want to do.   Oh. We're -- we're way beyond that.   I am trying to figure out the difference between the two sides here. And I guess you can only answer for half of it. But I suspect the difference is you are saying that there is enough evidence here to allow a district court to exercise its discretion, but not enough to reverse a district court if it did not exercise its discretion in favor of allowing the hearing. Is that right?   And I suspect the other side will be saying there is not only enough to enable the district court to make the finding of -- of a hearing, but there's enough to compel the district court to do that. We'll -- we'll see what they say about that.
13-316 +++$+++    I think on anybody's theory, you -- you have to show that -- that the monies, funds, credits, assets, securities or other property was owned by or under the custody or control of the financial institution.   Doesn't either side have to prove that?   But -- but the jury has to be instructed that the money's coming out of the bank.   Well, why doesn't that principle cover most of the cases you're worried about?   Why -- why wouldn't your view have enabled you to win this case?   So if we think that was wrong, there's a lot less to this case than meets the eye.   Doesn't -- doesn't that U.CC question arise anyway under the requirement that you have to -- you have to obtain bank property?   Doesn't it require you to ultimately decide who's -- who's going to be stuck with the -- with the empty bag?   I understand that. But -- but if you accept the government's view --   -- of how these third-party cases ought to -- ought to be resolved, you have to get into the U.CC, don't you.   That's certainly been my experience. (Laughter.)
13-317 +++$+++    It's certainly not the rule --it's certainly not the rule that every -- every issue that is common has -- has to be decided at the preliminary -- or I'm sorry, must be left to the merits. I mean, as you point out, the very issue of whether the market is efficient is something that could be decided for everybody at the merits stage, right?   How many -- how many of these cases -- what percentage of these cases continue once there has been class certification? Do you have any idea?   Very few. Once you get the class certified, the case is over, right?
13-339 +++$+++    Suppose -- suppose a State has -- most of these statutes of repose are piggybacked on top of statutes of limitation, right? I mean, you know, you have to sue within 10 years after -- after you find -- you find the injury. But in any case, a suit must be brought within -- within 20 years after -- after the act. That's the basis of your suit, right? But let's assume you -- you have a State which only has a statute of -- of repose. It just says any suit for -- for this act of negligence must be brought within 10 years after the act occurred. Is that still a statute of repose? It seems to me then that would meet your -- your definition of -- of the commencement time for suit, would have to be when -- when the act occurred, and then you have 10 years from that.   But that's the beginning. It doesn't give permission. It just says, you know, you're liable for negligence of -- in this -- in this area, but any suit must be brought within 10 years after the act occurred.   Yes, but my hypothetical was different. There -- there is no such distinction. There is no statute of limitations. It's only what you call a statute of repose. And I think you have to say that in that situation, it is no longer a statute of repose, that it's a statute of limitations.   When was this statute enacted? What was it?   '86. I thought--Okay.   To tell you the truth, I've never heard of this distinction between statutes of repose and statutes of limitations.   Well, yes. But have they ever -- have they ever drawn a distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose? Is there any Federal statute that makes that distinction or -- or is there any Federal statute which applies only to statutes of repose?   Oh yeah. It exists. I mean, these statutes exist, but -- but are they called statutes of repose? Or are they -- are they not considered, as I used to consider them when I was in law school and even as late as 1986, I -- I would have considered that a statutes of limitations. Now, you think Congress is smarter. They -- they know the law better.   And everybody was listening to that. The chamber was full and -- (Laughter.)   Are you acknowledging that if a State had only a so-called statute of repose, that -- that the Federal limitation would apply to that? It's only a statute of -- of repose piggybacked on what we've been calling a statute of limitations. It's only that one that survives.   I think you can answer the question yes -- yes or no.   Right.   That's why you want to give it away.   Okay. You have a statute to say there is -- there is a cause of action for X, okay, and a separate statute -- there exists a cause of action for X. And a separate statute which says any -- any suit for X cannot be brought after 10 years from the act of the defendant that is the basis for the claim. Okay? Why -- why isn't that the commencement date on which you can bring suit where -- where the act occurs.
13-354 +++$+++    Well, there -- there's another respect in which this, even as originally enacted, does not track the -- the preemployment Division v. Smith law. That is to say, the -- the compelling State interest test in the prior cases was never accompanied by a least restrictive alternative requirement. That was an invention of this -- of this law.   Well, of course it wouldn't be the same price at the end of the day. If they deny health insurance, they're going to have to raise wages if they are going to get employees.   It's absurd to say that, you know, it comes out of nowhere.
13-369 +++$+++    But you -- you acknowledge that it -- it would be a valid patent if all you said is you have to space these things and you figure out what the spacing is going to be. You -- you can -- you can get a patent for -- tell somebody trial and error. Let's take Edison's light bulb. I mean, could he say, you know, get some material that -- that will -- will illumine when -- when electricity is passed through it and you figure out by trial and error what this material might be. Might be tungsten, who knows, you know. Maybe it's chewing gum. Would that be a valid patent?   So I don't -- I don't really understand this trial and error spacing stuff. What -- what is the limit on trial and error? Can you get patented anything when you say, you know, this is the basic principle, you figure out what -- you know, what makes it work.   No. I understand that.   I'm asking why the second construction is -- is a plausible patentable invention.   All the person skilled in the art will know is that he has to figure out what the spacing is, right?   But -- but still the -- the inventor doesn't tell you what the spacing has to be.   Well, the only -- the only analog that comes to my mind immediately is our review of agency action. Is -- is that the standard that you want us to use? If -- if, you know, it's within the scope of the ambiguity, oh, we don't think that's the right answer. But it's close enough for government work. Is that -- is that what you want us to apply to patents?   Can it be reasonable but wrong.   I see. Whatever interpretation is wrong is ipso facto unreasonable?   Okay. So whatever is wrong is -- is, by your definition -- you know, we -- we construe statutes all the time, and we certainly don't think that the result we come to is the only reasonable result. We think it's the best result, but not the only reasonable one. But you're saying in this field there's a right result and everything else is unreasonable.   Yes, that's what I proposed first. But I thought -- I thought you didn't like that.   Yes. We understand all that. I -- I'm still having trouble understanding what your standard is. You -- you agree that your standard is not, there is a right answer and everything that is not the right answer is unreasonable. That's not your position.   Right?   Okay. Then you invoke Chevron. Do you mean that anything that would pass Chevron's step one is okay?   That is, if it would pass Chevron's step one it's ambiguous.
13-461 +++$+++    Do you have some other rebuttal points?
13-483 +++$+++ 
132, Orig. +++$+++         But how much -- how much did the Commission give before this?             It just did that out of the goodness of its heart?        And -- and I think that one of the best indications of what -- what a contract means is the manner in which the parties act under the contract, and that suggests to me that it was never contemplated that North Carolina alone would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this license.          Were there any benefits to the contract at all until -- unless and until there was a waste facility constructed?          What?         It sounds to me pretty hypothetical.   And I find it difficult to believe that there is an obligation to commit money and a liability for failure to do so in a compact which says that the State can withdraw at any time.            You talk about good faith withdrawal.            What would be bad faith withdrawal?   North Carolina simply says:           It's no longer worth our trouble.         Why?        Do you have any precedent from this Court for reading into a contract between States an obligation of good faith?         Why did they agree to it?         Once again, they are just tender-hearted?    I mean, even though North Carolina had an obligation to fund all of it?              They just come forward and say:    Yes, extort us.           I mean, I --         I suggest it's not the power to extort; it's the power to withdraw.              And that power to withdraw suggests that there is no absolute obligation to come up with the funding.                The two seem to me so -- so inconsistent with -- with one another.         So long as you can withdraw at any time --        Wait.       I don't -- I don't understand that.        It never passes through the States, and this provision just waves a magic wand and says that it represents the financial commitments of all party States to the Commission. What proportion from each State?           Do we know?        I think all this means is that that is the only financial commitment that the States are obliged to -- to make.        It can't be the money of the States if you can't say how much of it belongs to each State.         That just doesn't make any sense.        The ability to withdraw terminates upon completion of the facility?        Six months afterwards.               So the -- the facility's completed.          It's clear they are going to have to -- they are going to be charging more than South Carolina, which is a lower cost facility, having been in existence for longer.                Why wouldn't everybody get out?
134 ORIG +++$+++              Was it clear that New Jersey believed when it had authorized somebody to wharf out, that the person who wharfed out was not subject to New Jersey's environmental laws?             The history doesn't show anything about that?             So if --             -- if it -- if it would have been subject to New Jersey's environmental laws, had New Jersey owned the bed of the river into which the wharf was extended, by parity of reasoning it seems to me the wharf would be subject to Delaware's environmental laws if Delaware owns the bed of the river.             I don't --              I have a more basic question.   Assume -- assuming that the subaqueous land belongs to New Jersey and that New Jersey gives a private individual a right to wharf out into the Delaware, does that individual acquire ownership of the land under the water, assuming New Jersey owns the subaqueous land?              But, normally, authority to wharf out doesn't convey the land with it; does it?              Of the wharf.              Of the wharf.              Now, if -- if merely authority to wharf out would not even convey New Jersey's own land, how can you argue that, by reason of this Compact, it implicitly conveyed what is now Delaware's land?             May continue to wharf out, but not continue to grant subaqueous land, which you say doesn't go with wharfing out.             Could New Jersey -- could New Jersey prevent its use for liquified gas?             Well -- but New Jersey had given this riparian owner the right to wharf out.             So, obviously, the right to wharf out does not include the right to use the wharf for whatever you like, and the only thing we're arguing about is whether it is New Jersey or Delaware that can impose limitations.      But that it is subject to limitation is, it seems to me, absolutely clear.              Mr. Farr, could you tell me -- one thing in Article VII perplexes me.                      Why does it say that each State may "make grants, leases, and conveyances of riparian lands and rights"?                      "Rights" I can understand.    But why would they say "conveyances of riparian lands"?              I mean, obviously each State can -- riparian lands are within each State. Nobody questioned that at the time.              So you say "riparian lands" means the land under the wharf?               That's a strange use of "riparian lands."              Do you know of any other instance where people talk of riparian lands and they mean land extending under the water?              That's your position, that "lands" means the lands under the water?              It's a one-way pass.     Why shouldn't it be a one-way veto?              It doesn't give Delaware anything.
137, Orig. +++$+++        You -- you say you get the same amount of water and it's up to -- it's up to Wyoming to figure out who they have to cut down for not putting back enough to meet that amount?     You don't care what private owner it comes from?     It's up to Wyoming to figure out who has to be cut back?       I'm trying to help you. (Laughter.)       Under like water supplies, yes.       Could you tell me the -- I didn't get the page of the Special Master's report which you asserted adopts your -- your definition of beneficial use.     What page was it?       It seems to say what you say it says.       Yes, but your people can do that.     Your people can get more use out of the same amount of water diverted by going to sprinkler irrigation, whereas the people in Wyoming can't.     That's a little unfair, it seems to me.     Right?       Your people are entitled to take out the same amount they took out before, right? Pre-1950?       Whereas the people in Wyoming, you say, are not entitled to take out the same amount; they are entitled only net the same amount that they had before.     Whereas downstream your people can take out the same amount and whereas before 20 percent of it used to go back into the stream, they can now make use of that whole 20 percent through sprinkler irrigation, right?     It gives you a great advantage. I mean, maybe that's the way it was written, but -- but don't tell me that this is even-handed, because it -       I would think your best point is not all of that stuff, but simply the definition section, which very clearly makes a distinction between beneficial use and diversion.     And your point is that what is guaranteed is not the diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water, not -- not the total amount diverted. If -- if there were not both of those definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your case would be a little harder.     But with the two of those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial use rather than -- it could have said diversion, appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say that.     It said to beneficial use. Well, why -- why define beneficial use that way if you don't mean it?     That's your best point, isn't it?       Well, all right.       Where is that again - where at?
138, Orig. +++$+++            Mr. Frederick, we -- we had a case involving, what, a tax on -- on oil companies, in which it was a State against State case, but we allowed the oil companies who would pay the tax to intervene. Now, why is that any different from this case?          Why does that make any difference?          Yes, well, these   these are rules that we are making up ourselves, right, as to when we are going to allow intervention or not?           Do  - is there any case -- I think there isn't, but tell me if I'm wrong -- is there any case in which we have rejected intervention that has been recommended by the Special Master?           Well, except that these -- these three entities are the principal entities that are guilty of interbasin transfers, which is essentially what the -- what the dispute is about.           Well, but the focus -- the focus of the complaint is upon interbasin transfers, isn't it?           Exactly.     And these three entities account for a very large proportion of those interbasin transfers.   Isn't it the case that any -- any decision by -- by this Court on -- on this question will necessarily impact directly these three entities?           Why not?           I understand that, but I'm talking about the real world.            If -- if indeed North Carolina has to cut back, and if indeed the opinion of this Court says that it's taking too much because of interbasin transfers, as a practical matter these three entities are going to be out of luck.              Are you --           But, in fact, we've never rejected a special master's desire to -- to have intervenors in the case.           And that oil case that I mentioned.   I forget the name of it.            The tax --          Yes.     What had the Special Master recommended in that case?             Well, we've -- we've allowed private parties to be impleaded by the States. We have allowed one State to sue another State and a private party.               I don t --          It depends on, I suppose, on what you mean by  is not properly represented by the State.     If you think the State does not have a sufficient interest to defend that -- that particular right vigorously, might that not be -- might not that qualify?          I think you could say that realistically when you are talking about an individual water user, a small potatoes water user, a normal resident of Charlotte perhaps.         But when you are talking about the biggest entities that are going to be affected by the apportionment, it really doesn't ring true to me.          Did the special master think Philadelphia should have been let in?          The answer is no.          Yes, but we haven't -- we haven't been sitting there trying to figure out what would facilitate the proceeding.          Much of the discovery in the case has already focused on these three entities, hasn't it?          So to say that they are just -- you know, they are just Joe Dokes is  - is really very unrealistic.           Well, if that -- if and when that is the case, the Special Master will not want them to come in, as the vast majority of special masters have not wanted them to come in, in the past.           I don't think that's going to change.           But not reserved exclusively to State -- to suits between a State and another State.   We've allowed it to cover suits between a State and another State and private citizens of the other State.           Well, it isn't a matter of infringing on water rights or apportionments.         I mean, that does not exclude, it seems to me, the revocation of the license or the denial of a renewal of the license because Duke Power does not have enough water.         That wouldn't preclude that, would it?           I don't -- I don't understand that.   I don't understand that.           Well, why --          Well, it may also mean it when it has to increase the outflow, the level of its impoundments reduces, and that may affect its ability to generate power, which in turn may -- may affect its license.             But it affects the agreement on which the license is based.             The license was based upon a very hard negotiated agreement among a number of entities.          I thought Duke said the problem is not the United States -- so much the United States granting a license.       It's the license we requested was based upon a negotiated agreement among a number of entities, and that agreement goes out the window once -- on the basis of this lawsuit.
11-398 +++$+++        Well, that depends, as -- as the Government points out, on whether that directive is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a directive to him and to the courts.     All of the other directives there seem to me to be addressed to the Secretary.     Why should this one be directed to the courts?     When you say "in the same manner," he goes about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless adjudicate the cases.       Well, he's assessing and collecting it in the same manner as a tax.       So, it seems to me it's a question you can't answer.     It's a question which asks why should there be any jurisdictional rules?     And you think there should be.       There's at least some doubt about it, Mr. Long, for the reasons that Justice Breyer said, and I thought that we had a -- a principle that ousters of jurisdiction are narrowly construed; that, unless it's clear, courts are not deprived of jurisdiction.     And I find it hard to think that this is clear.     Whatever else it is, it's easy to think that it's not clear.       Don't do it again, because I think that goes too far.     I don't think that's restraining the collection of the tax.     It's restraining the payment of the tax.       You don't want to let that bone go, right? (Laughter.)
11-400 +++$+++        Mr. Clement --       -- do -- do you agree -- do you agree that the government has to act reasonably?       Do -- do we strike down unreasonable statutes?     My God!       The Executive has to act reasonably, that's certain, in implementing a statute; but if the statute says, in so many words, that the Secretary can strike the whole -- funding for the whole program, that's the law, unreasonable or not, isn't it?       Mr. Clement, I didn't take the time to figure this out, but maybe you did.     Is there any chance that all 26 States opposing it have Republican governors, and all of the States supporting it have Democratic governors? Is that possible?       Yes.     Yes. (Laughter.)       What are your second and third?     I'm on pins and needles to hear your second -- (Laughter.)       Mr. Clement, the Chief has said I can ask this.       As -- as I recall your -- your theory, it is that to determine whether something is coercive, you look to only one side, how much you're threatened with losing or offered to receive.     And the other side doesn't matter. I don't think that's realistic.     I mean, I think, you know, the -- the old Jack Benny thing, your money or your life, and, you know, he says, "I'm thinking, I'm thinking."     It's -- it's funny, because it's no choice.     You know?     Your life?     Again, it's just money.     It's an easy choice.     No coercion, right?     I mean -- right? Now, whereas, if -- if the choice were your life or your wife's, that's a lot harder. Now, is it -- is it coercive in both situations?       Really?       It's a tough choice. And -- and --       No, no, no.     To say -- to say you're -- when you say you're coerced, it means you've been -- you've been given an offer you can't refuse.     Okay?     You can't refuse your money or your life.     But your life or your wife's, I could refuse that one. (Laughter.)       No, I'm talking about my life.     I'd say take mine, you know? (Laughter.)       How could we use that example? Forget about it. (Laughter.)
12-1226 +++$+++    Most favored nations treatment.   It doesn't have to be read that way. It -- it could be read that way, and it could -- it could also mean that if you give it to employees generally, you have to give it to pregnant employees, although there may be special -- special classes. I think one of the briefs had an example about, you know, if -- if you have your -- your senior employees driven to work when -- when -- when they are unable to drive themselves, you have to do the same for pregnant women. Would you say that that's the case?   Why not?   So you do assert it's a -- it's a most favored nation provision. You -- you have to give the benefits that you give to any other class of employees, right?   How long -- it doesn't matter whether that class is enormous or small, right?   Does -- does the record show what you have asserted here, that the classes that are given special treatment is almost everybody?   Does the record show that?   I understand.   Most favored nation. So you're coming down to most favored nation. And that makes sense and that's easy for my colleague to describe. He can write that down in his opinion.   That's right.   I'm so relieved.   I thought we felt that we don't give deference to the EEOC.   Oh, come one. So we give what -- what do you call the other kind of deference? I mean, gee, you give that to me even when -- even when I'm in dissent. I mean, that just means, you know, treat it for what it's worth.   But we don't give you any more deference than we give the EEOC, though, right?   What the best reading is, regardless of what you think.
12-1497 +++$+++    Didn't some states used to have no statute for -- for murder, and yet had a statute of limitations on wrongful death claims? I think that's -- that's the case, with respect to state law, 5 anyway.   How about "former"?   "Pending" is a very strange word to pick.   It's dismissed for failure to prosecute.   For nonmerits ground, and so nobody else can come in?   But it's -- it's not a pending action later. I mean, when that action's been dismissed or been completed, you say that a later action is prohibited even though there is no pending action, right?
126, Orig. +++$+++    What is -- what is that mechanism? What -- what does that process entail?   I think your objection is that what the parties really intended was to adopt this particular formula, which they knew might be inaccurate. And that's -- what's the parallel is -- is not buying horses in a barn, but buying whatever animals are in the barn. Although both parties believed it was a mix, it turns out that was wrong. But the deal was the deal, right? They were --   They were rolling the dice.   Whatever animals were in the barn.   How -- how do we decide -- is -- is this a guestion on which we have to defer to the master's factfinding? Is it a guestion of fact what the parties intended? Or are we to look at the agreement and decide it from the agreement?   Well, I'm going to give more deference, I suppose, if -- if I think it is entirely relevant what the prior negotiations were, and that it was appropriate for him to look into that. And to reach the conclusion he did.   If on the other hand, I think it's -- it's the text of the agreement that governs, I don't care what he found about the negotiations.   It seems to me, it's rather like asking a man who believes he's been wrongfully convicted whether he would like to die by the firing sguad or the electric chair. I mean, you -- you didn't want any remedy to be imposed.   And for the master to ask you, oh, you tell me what remedy I should impose, you don't think he should have impose any.   Well, You got money. You got money, didn't you? You got damages.   But you want more than damages. You -- you want to say I not only want to receive what it cost me, what your violation cost me, but I want in addition to receive any benefits that you got from the violation.   That's not a normal contract remedy.
13-1010 +++$+++    You acknowledge that? See, I wouldn't acknowledge that if I were you.   You don't believe in the parol evidence rule?   Unless, of course, the Yard-Man presumption is normal contract interpretation. That is, you know, the court of appeals could be saying that when you look at the totality of the contract where the benefits are being given for, as payment for work, you get them if you've worked so many years, they increase when you've worked more years. Where that is the case, it is a reasonable assumption, call it a presumption if you like, that any promise to pay those benefits continues after the termination of the -- of the union contract. In other words, I'm not sure that the court of appeals would agree that -- that this presumption is contrary to normal contractual interpretation. I think the court of appeals would say that is normal contractual interpretation.   But you answered the guestion. The answer is yes, right? The company can terminate. You're saying it hasn't terminated here, it's a nice company; but it doesn't have to be a nice company, does it? Isn't that your position?   What I would like to hear, earlier you said there were two reasons: One was the termination clause and second that the contract had to be read in light of the background rule -- then you got cut off. And I really want to know what the background rule you were about to refer to was.   What's the second one -- before you get cut off again, what's the second one?   Well, I don't think it's reversing that. I think it's -- it's an argument of -- of contractual expression, contractual intent. It says if you tie the continuing receipt of health benefits to the continuing receipt of retirement benefits, and if you know that retirement benefits survive the termination of the contract, right? You acknowledge that.   It seems to suggest that -- that health benefits continue as long as retirement benefits do. Now, I mean, maybe there are other indications, but that one certainly seems to -- seems to tie health benefits to retirement benefits.   I mean, this thing is obviously an important feature. Both sides knew it was left unaddressed, so, you know, whoever loses deserves to lose for casting this upon us when it could have been said very clearly in the contract. Such an important feature. So I hope we'll get it right, but, you know, I can't feel bad about it. (Laughter.)   He agrees with you, doesn't he? I mean, you're not going to argue that, are you?
13-1019 +++$+++    Mr. Goldstein, if I understand your argument, you're saying that there is an obligation to conciliate, but that obligation does not have to be pursued in good faith.   So that the -- even if the Commission enters upon a conciliation process, you think that the outcome of that is reviewable?   That was my guestion.   It can declare when the finish line is, but it can do that in bad faith.   Yes. You're saying yes, it can do that in bad faith.   And it can say that in bad faith.   Well, is it correct or not correct?   Because I don't understand your argument.   So fair application of the statute is reviewable, so that the proper -- I mean, we're just guibbling over, you know, how bad it is, that's right.   Can I ask something about this?   Conciliation I thought would be conciliation between the complaining parties and the employer.   But -- and that's wrong?   Between the EEOC and the employer?   So even if the complaining party is willing to accept $500,000 rather than a million, if the EEOC says a million, the EEOC is conciliated.   Well, no. Under the law, you tell me it is conciliated.   I  I think your response is persuade him about what?   He tried to persuade him about what? If you didn't even make an offer, there was nothing to -- what, persuade him not to commit suicide?
13-1032 +++$+++    Well, it often happens. It's a jurisdictional issue. So what's the point?   I mean, the fact that she didn't raise it is irrelevant. In fact, even -- even if she didn't raise it here, we would have to raise it here, wouldn't we?   Oh, the comity, okay. And you -- you agree it has nothing to do with the -- with the principal guestion?   Excuse -- if the -- if the -- would the State be seeking the relief?   The State would be seeking to enjoin its own tax?   Well, but that -- that just means the district court should throw it out. I mean, I   But the statute's addressed to the courts. And the statute says the courts will not enjoin State -- State taxes. Now, how -- how can that mandate to the court be altered by -- by private parties?   It seems to me it says that we just don't have the power, period. But you say the States can give us the power?   Well, that's -- that's fine. I -- I can understand that. You say they used to think that it didn't apply, now they're saying it applies. I agree, that's a good argument. But you're arguing much beyond that. You're arguing that it doesn't matter any more because they once said that they wanted the Court to decide it, even though the Court had no power to decide it, right? I mean, that's a different argument. It's that one that I criticize. If you want to say the State's argument seems weaker because they've changed their mind, that's fair enough.   My very point. So what? Go ahead.   Well, I'm not sure what -- what you have conceded. Do you acknowledge that if there were a State law which reguired in-State sellers not to collect the tax, but just to advise the -- the State revenue service that someone has purchased an item on which tax is due, would you acknowledge that that could be enjoined? That someone could bring a suit saying, I'm not the taxpayer, this is not the assessment or collection of a tax, and therefore you -- a suit will lie for me to say that this is an unconstitutional assessment or imposition upon me. Would that suit lie or not?   Well, it's -- it's a Federal constitutional violation.   So the only thing that would make the States able to do -- to get information about tax liability without being sued in Federal court is the fact that the person from whom the information is sought is liable for the tax, if the seller has to retain the sales tax.   I don't know what you mean by a third party acting in regard to --   Oh, of course.
13-1034 +++$+++    I mean, that's lovely, but it doesn't get you around the guestion that Justice Alito asked, what is the law? May I make a suggestion?   Perhaps the law -- if you ask somebody what law did Mellouli violate here, it would be perfectly natural to respond by reciting one -- the elements of the law that he violated. He was convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia to store a controlled substance. And so also with any other violation of a law that names a number of controlled substances. If you ask what law did -- did you violate, he would say, I violated the -- the law that made it unlawful to have marijuana or that it made it unlawful to have cocaine. It seems to me you've got to -- you -- you have to divide the word "law" and the word "regulation" up into the component elements of the law or regulation before you can reach the result that you would like to reach.   Is that a good suggestion? (Laughter.)   Well, well, well, wait. Only -- only using the modified approach so that you would show it was -- it was intended to be used with crack. But on its face, if the Kansas statute still covers crack, yes, but a lot of other stuff --   -- that alone would not support the conviction, would it?   You -- you'd have to go to look to see what he was actually convicted of.   Nobody's disagreeing with the categorical approach. I don't know why you're wasting your argument on that. We -- we all agree with the categorical approach.   The guestion is categorical to what? That's the issue.   That's not his hypothetical. His hypothetical is a statute that includes one drug which is not on the Federal list.
13-1041 +++$+++    Well, things have changed so much mainly because of this Court's interpretations. Was it not the envision by the original APA that substantive rules had to have notice and comment because they would indeed be reviewed by courts on the basis of abuse of discretion? I mean, you know, whether it's 25 centimeters or 250 centimeters for a particular substantive rule there's no way for a court to say that that's right or wrong. Whereas, it was certainly envisioned by the original APA, was it not, that interpretative rules would not be given any deference by the courts, and that's why there didn't have to be notice and comment, because the APA says in so many words that all issues of law shall be decided by the court.   Yes, yes, yes. You can say that, but that's not what anybody thought when the APA was passed.   Change in administration?   Isn't that a more likely explanation?   So is it a second -- second flip-flop? Maybe -- maybe we shouldn't give deference to agency interpretations of its own regulations. That would solve this -- the problem of this case. For me it would be easy.   I understand it's not before the Court, but my perception of what is before the Court would be altered if I didn't think that courts had to give deference to these flip-flops.   Why -- why should there be a difference.   Why should there be a difference between the two, between the treatment of substantive rules and interpretative rules?   Well, nonsense. So long -- whether it's an interpretative rule or a substantive rule, it is reviewed by a court with deference, right?   And you want us to give the same deference to both.   So what the court says about, in its substantive rule, is just as much or no less law than what a court says in its interpretative rule. If the court is within the -- the bounds of ambiguity, it is the law. And a court cannot change it. So why should there -- you know, I -- I just don't understand the difference in treatment between the two.   So you're not -- you're not relying on the good faith exception, right? Just on your generosity in interpreting --   We're going to write this down.   We're going to write this down and quote you in future cases.
13-1074 +++$+++    Jurisdictional in the narrow sense.   Yes, that's what I --   That was in the text of the recodification?   Does legislative history support that, too?   Irwin said this was just a presumption, right?   And it said the presumption could be overcome and it made clear that this is a guestion of what was the congressional intent. When you put all those three together, of course, you have to look at each statute separately, don't you?   A living Federal Tort Claims Act is what we're talking about here. (Laughter.)   If we were to adopt the position that a statute can change in light of current circumstances, what would that Congress think about it today, would there be any reason to limit that to the Federal Tort Claims Act, that proposition?   We're into judge Calebresi's manner of statutory interpretation, right?   Mr. Martinez, I hate to cut into your time, but it's important to me to understand why you think that if we rule for you, we will not be saying that every statute which allows suit against the Federal government and which uses the words "shall be forever barred" will not have to come out this way. What distinguishes this case from all those others?
13-1075 +++$+++    Didn't our cases --   Didn't -- didn't the private right of action cases suggest rather strongly that Cort v. Ash was wrong? That the prior notion that when Congress says nothing about it, there is an implied cause of action was wrong?   And have we -- have we said that prior notions of what Congress meant in the past about jurisdiction were wrong at the time?   So I don't think the two are parallel at all.   Have you stopped beating your husband, right?
13-1080 +++$+++    Well, it wouldn't resolve the guestion. Only -- only perhaps for delegation purposes. But -- but it doesn't resolve the -- the other issue in the case, which is due process. That is to say, even if this is a governmental entity, there are some things that governmental entities can't do. And, indeed, I think that the case law in this area relies on the due process clause more than on the distinction simply between public and private entities.   It was raised.   And it's -- and it's argued here.   Yes. But the statutory preference reguirement reguires -- would reguire consideration of whatever is determined by this body, right?   What must it consider?   I don't -- I don't see how you can say he's an inferior officer. He's supervised by nobody. That's what we have held to be the -- the touchstone of principal versus inferior.   That's it. And supervised by nobody.   A limited task is -- is not the touchstone. I mean, that's what we said in Morrison and we repudiated it in a later case, which said the touchstone of a -- of a principal officer is whether that person is not subject to control by somebody else. And I don't see how this person is subject to any control in -- in the task that he's assigned.   Let me -- let me talk about regulatory effect. As I understand it, once these -- what do you call them?   The metrics and standards. Once they were issued, wow, the -- the on-time record of Amtrak went way, way up. So they had a very immediate and clear effect on the behavior of -- of the parties. Now, do you think that because the sentencing guidelines are now just advisory that we could have the sentencing guidelines issued by some private party that -- that is not appointed pursuant to the reguirements of the Constitution? Because after all, they're just advisory. Now, the reality is, they have a significant effect on -- on the behavior of -- of lower courts. And I think it's the same thing here. There's a significant effect. I don't know --   Why did the record improve so -- so rapidly and so promptly?   Wow, I didn't mean that. (Laughter.)   Would you talk about the contract provision?   You should have raised that in your -- I should have raised it in your principal.   But if they can't come to an agreement, who decides what the contract --   And the STB   Which would include -- which would include the reguirement that, to the extent practicable, the standards set forth by Amtrak be followed.   Well, as -- as your friend said, to the extent practicable, unless the whole thing is nugatory, certainly does not wash out the whole provision.   It must have some bite. What bite does it have?
13-1174 +++$+++    You addressed it where, Footnote 1 of --   Okay.
13-1175 +++$+++    I suppose in motels they can see what rooms have cars in front of them. And I suppose as to room 1204 they can see, usually behind the desk what -- what keys are missing, what -- what rooms appear not to be occupied.   What's the probable cause for the warrant?   If you haven't seen the register, what's the probable cause?   What, do you have to have a policeman sit outside the hotel for -- for days to -- I mean, you don't have probable cause unless you know that there -- there are people who are, you know, in -- in the room for a short time who haven't registered.   Whose expectation of privacy are we talking about?   Not the hotel guests; right?   Yes. That's what I thought. It's --   -- of the hotel.   You can't see my register. It's -- it's dear to me.   Yes. I -- I assume that, you know, if the problem is license plates and credit card information and all of that, it's not up to the hotel to complain about that invasion of privacy. It's up to the guests, right?   And this case does not involve the guests. It's just the hotel who's objecting.   Is this a public hunting lodge?   Well, that's a big difference, isn't it?   There  there -- there is no dispute here that you can require the hotel to keep the records.   Is that right?   I think there would be a big dispute with regard to private hunting lodges, whether you could require them to keep the records.
13-1211 +++$+++    Well, why doesn't the -- it seems to me the question for the jury is -- is not whether they look alike, but whether they create the same commercial impression. And it seems to me the instructions to the jury would say these are the two marks, now what you ought to know is that after the first mark there was a competitor who came into commerce called American Paging, and then the mark was changed from American Mobile Phone to American Mobile Phone Paging. Do you think that that second mark creates a different commercial impression than the first one? And I think a jury would say, heck, yes.   Do you think consistency appears in the -- in the judicial opinions that have treated this as a question of law? I mean, what -- what is the judge -- does he get cases and look at -- look at what other cases have said is tackable and what isn't tackable?   Even -- even the ones you -- you point us to do -- do not impress me as establishing any kind of -- look on page 50, dolphin to dolphin, and the second dolphin is stylized in -- in cursive writing, right? And that is upheld as -- as tackable. Then on the next page, on 51, the second one from the bottom, it -- it's the opposite progression, turbo in cursive goes to turbo in -- in capital letters and that is not permitted. I cannot for the life of me decide why the one should be permitted and the other should not be permitted.   And I'd much rather blame it on the jury than on the court. (Laughter.)
13-1314 +++$+++    Do I understand you to say that it would be okay if the legislature itself established this commission?
13-1333 +++$+++    Sure, it is. But if -- if that were the case, why -- why would the statute have to refer separately to dismissals for frivolousness by the district court or by the court of appeals? You could just -- it could have just said, if he's had a petition dismissed for frivolousness period, and that would mean it would have to go all the way up.   It separately says by the district court or by the court of appeals.   Well, I think on your theory, he wouldn't get two, he'd just get one.   The -- the dismissal is simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and that's one dismissal.   No. I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense for Congress to want a finality rule and yet to count it twice.   Why do you say that? Where do you get that out of the word "occasion"? I would -- I would think "occasion" means at any time prior, whether it's at the court -- whether it's at the district court or the court of appeals. You -- you read it. Why can "occasion" only mean what you suggest? Or mean what you suggest, period?   Mr. Shanmugam, I find it as one of the appealing points in your argument that you have a dismissal for frivolousness at the District Court level. It's counted as a third strike, and then that is reversed on appeal. So that, you know, turns out it shouldn't have been the third strike. And I don't know, what do you do in the last case? In the next case he has only two strikes. That is a messy situation. How often does that situation arise? How often is it that a District Court dismisses for frivolousness and is reversed by the Court of Appeals? Do you have any idea?   I hope so, because I don't think it happens very often.   It says the dismissal will not take effect. Why can't it say the dismissal -- you know, we think you deserve to be dismissed but we'll enter a stay so you can go up and see if we were right.   Now, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I mean, what's distinctive about yours is you have to wait for the period of the appeal. You have to -- and, you know, that could take a long time. And you talk about floodgates. The reason this statute exists is because of floodgates, because these prisoners file one -- one frivolous appeal after another.   Again  again, that's a big problem depending upon how frequent that is. If it's once in a blue moon, you know, it's no big deal.   Including strikes in Federal courts?
13-1352 +++$+++    Do you have to be an agent of the government for the Confrontation Clause to kick in?   Not primary. I'm asking, is it -- is it exclusive that no person who's not an agent of the government can trigger a Confrontation Clause protection? I mean, that's clearly not true. I mean, you -- you can have a cross-examination in a civil case, a lawyer in a civil case has somebody on the stand.   It is.   That's a private person.   It's a guestion of solemnity, but solemnity -- solemnity has nothing to do with whether you're a civilian or -- or a policeman.   Well, that -- that goes to the hearsay rule. I mean, you could -- you could have an exception to your -- to your hearsay rules. But -- but how could this child ever have the intent that Justice Sotomayor described? Which is the test of whether particular evidence is testimonial or not. How could a three and a half-year-old child have that intent?   What about the Due Process Clause? Do we -- have -- have we adopted hearsay rules under the Due Process Clause?   I thought it was up to the States, let it in and let the jury take it for what it's worth. I'm not sure we've ever --
13-1371 +++$+++    Of course, you could say the same thing about "adversely affect." I mean, that also is an active verb, right? And it also -- you had to adversely affect by discriminating.   So, you know, I -- the points you make are -- are true enough, but they were also true with -- with respect to Title VII, weren't they?   Make -- "make unavailable" is not the same language as "adversely affect." That's -- that's all that I'm willing to concede. And I think if you thought that Smith was wrong, which many people do, I suppose you could argue we will not expand Smith. And Smith hung on particular words, "adversely affect." Those words don't exist here, and, therefore, since we think Smith was wrong anyway, we're not going to extend it. That's -- that's a reasonable argument, but that's not the argument you're making. What -- what hangs me up is not so much that as it is the fact that Congress seemingly acknowledged the effects test in later legislation when it said that certain effects will not gualify. You know what I'm referring to?   Well, why doesn't that why doesn't that kill your case? I mean, when we look at a -- a provision of law, we look at the entire provision of law, including later amendments. We try to make sense of the law as a whole. Now, you see this statute which -- which has otherwise what is -- make unavailable, and it also has, however, it will not be a violation if these effects are -- are -- you read those together and you say, wow, this -- this law must mean mere effects gualify.   Is this in your brief?   Oh, I'm sorry.   Yeah.   But what -- you're -- you're telling us that these amendments which said that certain types of effects will not gualify, that the purpose of that amendment was to prevent erroneous court of appeals' decisions from affecting those particular areas?   That's a very strange thing for Congress to do, to believe that those court of opinions -- court of appeals' opinions are wrong and yet to -- to enact these exemptions. So even though those opinions are wrong, they will not apply to these things. I -- that's very strange.   It has to --   It has to construe the plain text of the law, and the law consists not just of what Congress did in 1968, but also what it did in '88. And you look at the whole law and you say, what makes sense? And if you read those -- those two provisions together, it seems to be an acknowledgment that there is such a thing as disparate impact. However, it will not apply in these areas that the 1988 amendment says. We don't just look at each little piece when it was serially enacted and say what did Congress think in -- in '68? What did it think in '72? We look at the law. And the law includes the '68 act and the '88 amendments. And I -- I find it hard to read those two together in any other way than there is such a thing as disparate 5 impact.   But they make no sense unless there is such a thing as disparate impact. It's -- they are prohibiting something that doesn't exist, right? I mean, you're saying that they prohibit something that doesn't exist.   Maybe I'm missing something here.   Didn't this Court decide Marbury v. Madison?   I mean, isn't that a big difference, I mean, between the situation here? This Court has never decided this issue. It's just the lower courts have -- have decided it in a uniform fashion. Have we ever before reversed uniform holdings of -- of courts of appeals, even those that have lasted 30 years? The answer is yes.   Which is not the case for the 10 percent plan that Texas uses.   There's no racial thing in that. If you're in the top 10 percent of your high school class, you go to the State university.   No race about it.
13-1402 +++$+++    I suppose the wife would have standing to appeal a wrongful conviction of her husband, right?   And in a regular criminal case, and he doesn't want to appeal, and she says, oh, I'm going to be deprived of my husband, so she has a right to appeal. Is that -- is that the law?   Let me give you an equally absurd hypothetical. Okay?   Wait. No, no, no, no. I'm saying the -- the feeling that the law can't be that. Assuming the man is not married and there is no wife who comes in and can make these points. But assume, likewise, there is incontrovertible evidence that he was denied admission because of his race or because of some First Amendment statement he had made or for whatever other reasons Justice Breyer wants to bring forward. Your position would be -- right -- too bad.   What?   I think he knew that.   Enough for me.   Does this fellow have a wife? Does this fellow have a wife or is this --   Oh, it's the wife that's -- that's making the claim.   Courts are very good at this stuff, aren't they?
13-1487 +++$+++    Well, I would assume it ought to be the gun owner's first preference. I mean, why -- why wouldn't that be the normal situation? His first preference is that it -- it should be sold to -- to individual X. And if the court cannot reject that, it should go there. And his second preference is, well, if you reject that, give it to Y. Wouldn't that be the normal?   You started off -- you were going to give us five pages in -- in the record, and you only got to two of them, I think. You want --   Just in case I'm unfortunate enough to get assigned this opinion. (Laughter.)
13-1499 +++$+++    Back all the way up --   -- and give us the three interests that you started off saying were at issue here. You never did get to that, did you?   Oh, it's your fault. (Laughter.)   What about the interest in judicial dignity?   Let's assume that that rule is written into judicial ethics. Would that stand?   No, no, but answer my guestion. Would that be okay?   An interest in judicial dignity. There are certain things that are infra dignitatem, as we say.   Good, honest, Midwestern state, they're not going to tell.   I mean, it doesn't -- it doesn't just go to a lawyer either. The -- the limitation is not solicitation of lawyers, is it?   It's anybody, which really makes me think that it has more to do with judicial dignity than -- than the corruption stuff we've been talking about. You can't solicit anybody.   I think -- I think you'd find the same statistics true with respect to political candidates, that they do much better when they -- when they put the arm on you personally, rather than having somebody else contact you. I can't imagine that'd be any different.
13-212 +++$+++    That's the only thing it prohibits is unreasonable seizures.
13-271 +++$+++    Well, that's -- that's no problem, I mean, they say that. That's conflict preemption.
13-352 +++$+++    I suppose --   I suppose in one sense the -- the trademark determination is broader rather than narrower than the infringement determination, right? The infringement determination just applies to one alleged infringer whereas the trademark registration would register the trademark as against the world. So I'm not sure that it's terribly narrower.   I -- I find it hard to believe that this board proceeding is -- is intended to -- to be expeditious, because the losing party can go up to the district court and start all over again de novo.   How is that expeditious? I don't understand that.
13-433 +++$+++    Couldn't you say that closing down the cash register is part of the job?   But getting yourself inspected as you leave -- as you leave the place of business is not part of the job. The other case where it's just part of the job.   You could not only say it; it seems to me true.   He could move his plant, for example, to be closer to the city where the employees live, right? So it takes him an hour to get to work. It's his fault that it -- that it takes them an hour instead of just 10 minutes. He should move his plant. It's just a matter of cost, right?   I suppose that it is also necessary to Amazon's business that it know how many hours each of its workers has worked, so it knows how much to pay them and doesn't pay them more, right? And -- and yet, there's no doubt whatever, is there, that punching in and punching out is not -- is -- is preliminary and postliminary, right?
13-435 +++$+++    Do you think that --   Do you think there's a difference between a factual basis and a reasonable factual basis? I mean, if we adopted a factual basis, would we accept an unreasonable factual basis?   I mean, I think it's -- it's just the same rule in -- in disguise really.
13-502 +++$+++    What about permanent signs? I assume that what you say about temporary signs would apply equally to permanent signs, wouldn't it?   Within the permanent sign category --   -- they all have to have the same --   -- except commercial, I assume.   What page?   What page is this again?   Got it.
13-517 +++$+++    But MCDonough did not have -- my problem is not -- is not that, the difficulty of proving that it did demonstrate dishonesty during the voir dire. My problem is what you also have to establish, namely that this does not constitute an inguiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment.   Look at 606(b)(1), and why are you raising this issue? Because you want to set aside the verdict, right?   Right.   Yes. But, of course, you'd -- you'd have no incentive to do that until you lose, right? So you would rather sit around and see if the verdict goes against you at which point you -- you would make the claim.   Nobody is going to make the claim before verdict comes out.   How about religious bias? Is that also an exception?   What about bias against handicapped people? I mean, all of those things are difficult to find. Right?
13-534 +++$+++    No, I don't buy -- I -- I think in the trade association case, I get off your train. It seems to me it's guite different to appoint a -- what should I say -- an entity that is already a conglomerate, which is already a contract or combination of individuals, and to authorize that separately created combination of individuals to enforce State law. I think that's guite different from saying we're going to have a board composed of dentists and we're going to pick the dentists.   And they are serving only in their individual capacity on this board, whereas the people in the trade association you're talking about are -- I guess the governors of the trade association are elected by the members; right?
13-550 +++$+++    But if -- if we agree that there had to be some significant event or change that would trigger the -- the need to reexamine this investment, then we would affirm.   Okay.   What's your position? That -- that every -- every stock that is owned has to be reviewed every year as though it was a new purchase?   I am sure some -- some such duty, but I am -- life is too short. You're -- you're going to ask every Federal district court not only to determine whether a particular purchase was sensible or not, but to say year by year whether you've done a careful enough review. I mean, I -- I just -- I just don't think courts are capable of doing that. The -- the other side offers some help by saying if there's a changed circumstance, you've got to do it.   And -- and you yourself say, Oh, well, this is a very special case, because it was obvious. Any fool would know that there are two classes of these stocks and the one class has a much cheaper expense to holding it. Why not say that where -- where there's been a change of circumstance or the imprudence of holding it is obvious?   The expense ratio is handled -- is handled in -- in what I propose. Where it's obvious on its face that you -- you continue the investment in the same company, but you -- you just get a different class of stock and you get lower charges.   That's obvious.   And that's fine. Would you just -- just give us a hint as to whether the government agrees with Mr. Frederick?   Yeah. So -- so you agree entirely that there's no -- no particular test --   -- not -- not obviousness or not change of circumstances?   That you are not going to address. Exactly.   Excuse me, though. It seems to me that -- that you -- you're -- you're misdescribing them when you say that they said it's only the purchase that can be subject to scrutiny. I -- I think they -- they did say that the holding can be subject to scrutiny as well so long as there has been some change in circumstance.   Now, you can say that, you know, that refers you back to a -- to a new -- new purchase standard, but it's still -- they -- they say that within that period, you can bring a suit.   Well, you want us to say that whatever it is, it isn't solely whether there's been a change in circumstances so extreme as to amount to purchasing a new stock.
13-553 +++$+++    Well, is said that -- it said that in -- in (b)(1), and it doesn't say that in (b) (4) .   Another tax that discriminates is all it says, whereas in (1) it said "as R value" -- "then the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction."   They're so specific there and -- and in (4) they just say another tax that discriminates against the rail carrier.   Yeah. There's a good reason that they didn't spell out a specific comparison class.   Mr. Brasher, what -- what's an ice cream wagon anyway? (Laughter.)   And the trucker tax is not directed to highways exclusively? It goes into a general fund?
13-604 +++$+++    But Mr. Fisher, we -- we don't review opinions. We review judgments, we review results. What you're complaining about here is the admission of what was discovered in the search of the car, right? Now, what difference does it make whether that was lawfully admitted because it was a constitutional search or it was lawfully admitted because the remedy of excluding it would not be applied if there was a mistake of law, a reasonable mistake of law? I mean, the constitutional problem is the admission of this evidence. And it seems to me whether it's properly admitted because the Fourth Amendment wasn't violated or whether it's properly admitted because the remedy for that violation is not -- is not exclusion of the evidence, you lose either way, don't you?   Well, we need to if we find, as you urge us to find, that it violates the Fourth Amendment to make the search. We would then have to -- in order to decide whether this judgment is lawful, we would have to decide whether the remedy of excluding that evidence has to be applied. And you know the answer to that --   Well, you have. I mean, you have and you acknowledge that it applies to remedies.   So the most you can get from us is a remand?   Just let the North Carolina law -- court decide whether -- whether the remedy of exclusion should have been --   That's because -- that's because they would be applying Federal law. They would be answering the guestion that you want us to leave unanswered; namely, whether the Constitution reguires that this evidence be -- be stricken from the case.   But if indeed they're not going to ask that guestion when we send it back, it seems to me we have to answer that guestion here before we are able to reverse or affirm the North Carolina court. It's a Federal guestion. They are not going to -- they are not going to get to that, but you're asking us to invalidate this conviction on the basis of Federal law. And it seems to me we cannot do that unless there has -- even if there has been a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy must be exclusion of -- of the evidence. That's a Federal guestion. I think we're going to have to decide it. If we send it back to North Carolina, they're not going to decide it. Are they?   But you're asking us to reverse it on the basis of Federal law and you're asking us to send it back to a State court which is not going to -- to inguire any further into Federal law, even though Federal law, arguably, you will concede says that even if there is a Fourth Amendment violation, if there's a good-faith reasonable belief that the law was violated, the remedy of exclusion will not be imposed. That's what the Constitution reguires. And you're asking us to say, oh, no, there's -- there's been a violation of the Constitution and we're going to reverse this judgment, even though we haven't inguired into whether the remedy that -- that you want is reguired. And it seems to me -- I don't see how we can do that.   They didn't get Federal law wrong. Their opinion got Federal law wrong, but their judgment did not get Federal law wrong if indeed a good faith mistake of law does not reguire the exclusion of the evidence from the trial. The judgment did not get Federal law wrong if that's the case.   We don't review analyses. We review judgments. You're -- you're urging that this conviction has to be set aside. That's what we're reviewing, the conviction, not the opinion.   Mr. Fisher, let me -- let me try my problem just one last time before your time. You -- you assert that -- that we -- we should not decide the remedy question because it hasn't been argued. But wasn't it your responsibility to argue it? You're asking us to set aside a judgment of the North -- North Carolina court. That judgment can be set aside only if, number one, the Fourth Amendment was not violated or, number two, it was violated, but the remedy does not have to be exclusion of the evidence. It's -- it seems to me it's your burden to establish not just that the Fourth Amendment was violated, but also that -- that exclusion was necessary under the Constitution. And it is no answer to say, well, that hasn't been argued. You haven't argued it. That's the problem.   Sent it back down for that court to decide the other piece. But this Court will not decide the other piece, as you acknowledge.
13-628 +++$+++    China objected to that. Did China not object to it?   Ms. Lewin, I -- I thought your position was you couldn't care less if the State Department thinks that this is going to interfere with our relations with the Palestinians, that Congress is entitled to do what it is authorized to do under the Constitution, even when that contradicts -- let's assume they can't recognize a country, but they can declare war on a country, can't they --   -- that the State Department has decided to recognize and -- and to be friendly with?   Congress can do that.   And you say can do the same here. And -- and the fact that the State Department doesn't like the fact that it makes the Palestinians angry is irrelevant.   In any case, this is not your main point, is it? You're -- you're being either forced into or willingly yield yourself to arguing that -- against the proposition that if this is recognition, it is invalid. But your main position is this is not recognition; it just has an effect on -- on the State Department's desire to -- to make nice with the Palestinians, and your position is Congress has no -- no compulsion to -- to follow that, assuming it can't recognize.   You don't claim that this is recognition.   I -- I guess there are competing canons here. I mean, one is, I suppose, that we listen to the State Department on matters of foreign affairs, but I suppose another one is that we do not hold a -- an act of Congress to be unconstitutional and thereby ineffective. So that seems to me a draw, doesn't it?   So the State Department says this amounts to recognition, and Congress says whether it does or not, we want -- we want this person to be able to list Israel.
13-6827 +++$+++    Mr. Laycock, the problem I have with -- with your client's claim of -- of religious reguirement is the religious reguirement is to grow a full beard, isn't it? Now, let's assume in the religion that reguires polygamy. I mean, could -- could I say to the prison, well, you know, okay, I won't have three wives; just let me have two wives. I mean, you're still violating your religion, it seems to me, if he allows his beard to be clipped to one -- one inch, isn't he?   Well, religious beliefs aren't reasonable. I mean, religious beliefs are categorical. You know, it's God tells you. It's not a matter of being reasonable. God be reasonable? He's supposed to have a full beard.   Okay. You think on the record that's what his religion would reguire if he can't have a full beard.   Yes. So maybe we should -- maybe this was improvidently granted. I don't want to do these cases half inch by half inch. Let's -- let's take a case that involves a full beard. I mean, the next -- the next case will be one inch, then one and a half inches, two inches.   You're arguing for all 1/2-inch beards, right? I mean, I --   We've got to assume all 1/2-inch beards are -- are okay if -- if God tells you to grow them, right?   Well, really subject  I mean, whose -- whose burden is that? I mean --   Is it your position that if, what, 90 percent of other -- of other institutions similar to the one at issue in the case permit the practice that is challenged, it cannot be a compelling interest? Is that your position?   I understand that. But I'm asking what is the relevance of the fact that other instances -- IS   Are we going to say whenever an institution comes up here that has a restriction which other institutions of the same type do not have, or at least a large majority of them, it's ipso facto bad?   Well, why does it have to show a distinction? It can just say the other States are wrong. We -- we think this is dangerous. I don't care what other States think.   Well, wait a minute. So vote more money. All you have to do is raise taxes. We're talking here about a compelling State interest. Bear in mind I would not have enacted this statute, but there it is. It says there has to be a compelling State interest. And you're -- you're asking, well, let's balance things; let's be reasonable. Compelling State interest is not a reasonableness test at all.
13-684 +++$+++    Well, let's talk -- let's talk about the first thing you say rescission is affected by. Okay? It seems to me that it's -- it's common usage to, for instance, one could say on Election Day you vote by going to the precinct and presenting identification. Now, that is not how you vote. That's a preliminary step to your voting, and I think that it's possible to read the "by giving notice" as -- as to say where -- where that's the only thing you have to do, as it is for the 3-day cancellation rescission, that's the end of it. But where there is something else to be done, where you have to return whatever you have received under the -- under the transaction, it seems to me more reasonable to read it as, you know, you vote by presenting yourself at the precinct and -- and offering identification.   Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. By notifying in accordance with regulations, it seems to me that speaks to the manner of notifying, not to the conseguence of notifying. And Regulation Z may indeed say what the conseguence is, but I don't think that the statute authorizes Regulation Z to say that.   Yes, but -- but in common law you had to give back in what you had received, and you have -- you -- you are urging that the statute creates a system in which a -- a creditor who has a secured interest, simply because somebody comes up almost 3 years later and says, you didn't give me two copies of this particular document, I got only one copy, and even if that's not true, immediately the secured interest is converted into an unsecured interest. That is a huge difference. And I find it difficult to believe that that's what Congress intended.   But it -- but it's not too late. (Laughter.)
13-7120 +++$+++    Counsel, is there any other use for a short-barreled shotgun?   People have purchased this even though it's criminal to possess it?
13-719 +++$+++    Well, how do we know that the reason the court of appeals did -- did not -- or sustained the refusal to take it, how do we know that the reason was that they disagree with you on what the standard -- what the court of appeals' reason was? How can we --   Right, and so your -- your -- your job is to argue that that was an abuse of discretion, because the statute says that they may, right? They may --   But the district court's opinion is not -- certainly not circuit law, so I think you exaggerate when you say it establishes bad law for the circuit. It just doesn't.   The circuit let the district court decision stand, but that doesn't make the district court decision circuit law.   And maybe it was wrong.   I see. You're just not relying on this case; you're relying on the fact that the district court relied on an earlier case.   We don't know what the Tenth Circuit did. You say the Tenth Circuit's decision. The Tenth Circuit made no decision. It declined to take the case, didn't it? It may -- the statute says it may, and it said we won't. And we don't know why they said that. Even the dissenters in the petition for en banc didn't say, oh, the court was wrong to stand by our earlier decision which you complain about. No, they said, you know, this was an important issue and we should have taken it. Now, you're saying we are going to review that decision as an abuse of discretion that you should have taken it. Right?   Is that right? It seems to me the statute gives the power to the court of appeals. It says the court of appeals may decline to take it. We can't override their judgment not to take it unless there is something unlawful about that judgment. You give us too much credit, you know, we don't have total power to make decisions, the courts of appeals are supposed to make.   Do you agree with that description of the dissent? Do you think the dissent said that that was the reason?   Yes. But the dissent didn't say why the court of appeals refused to take the case, did it? It didn't say the court of appeals refused to take it because it agreed with that prior decision. It didn't say that, did it?   Well, I guess it's an abuse of discretion whenever we fail to correct a clear error of law on a petition for certiorari. Right? And I'm not going to mention any names, but is that the case? It's an abuse of discretion. I thought we just had the power to say we don't feel like taking it.   Well, but we would sort of frustrate the statute, wouldn't we? The statute gives the court of appeals the discretion to decide whether there will be an appeal or not. And you're saying, oh, no, if they decide there won't be you -- you just reach in, and you have cert before judgment. I think that's a real frustration of the purpose of this statute, which says these matters, you know, are not all that significant. So it doesn't come to federal court. It stays in state court, who cares? We trust our state courts. I mean, the whole purpose of the statute is to make this, you know, a guick and dirty judgment. That's why they don't have to state reasons. They just say no appeal, or appeal. And you're saying, oh, no. It suddenly becomes laden with -- with all sorts of reguirements that if they're not observed, we -- we grant cert before judgment. I wouldn't think of doing that, well, with this statute anyway.
13-7211 +++$+++    Well, now, wait a minute. I -- you know, I have -- we -- we don't evaluate whether you had good counsel or bad counsel. You may have Clarence Darrow and still be denied effective assistance of counsel if Clarence Darrow makes one mistake. I mean, when -- when we find that there has been ineffective assistance of counsel, I think that means counsel failed to do one thing that he should have done. But there's -- there's no such general finding that counsel was -- was, in gross, ineffective. You're -- you're -- you're describing it as though -- as though that's what the finding is. That -- that's not what we hold when we find ineffective assistance of counsel. We find that this particular counsel made this mistake. That's it.   Well, why do you -- go ahead. Sorry.   Well, that's not true. It -- it can tell them what to do. The -- the basis on which the conviction was set aside cannot be repeated by the State court. You're -- you're saying that the State court can -- is -- is free to make the same mistake again?   But -- but -- but once you say we direct them to fix the constitutional error, that is something that they have to do on remand, isn't it?   Fix that constitutional error.   But this other constitutional error, which we didn't rule on in the habeas thing, they don't have to fix. It's up to them.   No, no, no, no. The -- the right to a trial that did not have this -- this failure of counsel, this particular failure. You're not entitled to -- to competent counsel. You're -- you're entitled to counsel who doesn't make a mistake. He could be the dumbest counsel around so long as he doesn't make a mistake. And he could be the smartest around, and if he does make a mistake, that's ineffective assistance of counsel.   Yes, but if you fail to put on the same evidence which the court of appeals had said the failure to produce constituted ineffective performance of counsel, if you do the same thing again, why wouldn't be that ineffective assistance of counsel?   Well, you answered no, but then your explanation produces yes. You're saying you don't have to cross-appeal because you won on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim; right? There is one, you know, omnibus ineffective assistance of counsel claim. You won on that; right?   So your answer to Justice Sotomayor should have been the opposite of what it was. If you said yes, you should have said no.
13-7451 +++$+++    Generis.   Why is it vague? It's it's just incredibly expansive.   What is vague about the fact that if you destroy a guestionnaire, you destroy a document with the intent of, what is it, to impede, obstruct or influence the investigation or proper administration. What's vague about it?   Wouldn't it be just as absurd to give him 20 years, though, wouldn't it?   Yes. I don't understand.   Of course, it doesn't entirely solve that problem, simply to narrow --
13-854 +++$+++    Well, is -- is it the same guestion whether a particular fact has to be submitted to the jury? And whether a particular fact-finding by the judge is entitled to deference or are they -- are they the same guestion?   I didn't think they were.   But to say -- to say -- I don't -- I don't agree with your response to Justice Kagan. To say that the -- that the fact-finding will be dispositive of the legal guestion is not to say that it is the same as the legal guestion, which is what I think you responded. I don't think it's the same as the legal guestion. The legal guestion is are you liable for violating this patent. And indeed, it -- it may be that -- that given a particular meaning that is established by a factual finding, the outcome is -- is virtually dictated, but it is not the same. It is not the same guestion.
13-894 +++$+++    No, it wasn't prohibited by the statute until there were regulations, right?   So it is prohibited by regulations. Let's not play games.   It would have one good effect and that is, it would make sure that the matter is important enough to occupy the President's attention and is not so insignificant that an agency that just doesn't want any whistleblower, doesn't want any criticism of what it's doing, can pump out these regulations. It would have that -- that salutary effect, wouldn't it?   Yes. But elsewhere in the same legislation, it refers to "prohibited by law, rule or regulation."   Here, it just said "by law." Elsewhere in the same statute it says, "by law, rule, or regulation." What am -- what am I supposed to conclude from that?   How do we know that?   If -- if that is true and if that is so obvious, Congress would not have -- have to have said "by law, rule, or regulation" in the other provision. It could just have said "by law" and what you said would automatically follow.   Boy, that is subtle. That is so subtle, that Congress is going to draw that distinction between substantive rules and procedural rules by saying "law" here and "law, rule, or regulation" there. You can spin out that argument, but the notion that this is what Congress had in mind when it enacted this thing or that any member of Congress had in mind when he voted for it, I -- I find that hard to believe.   Excuse me, I hate to interrupt you, but you worry me. I assume that if we find for your friend on the other side, the SSI regulations are not null and void. They would still apply to everybody except whistleblowers. Isn't that right?   It would still be a violation for anybody to make those disclosures unless he's doing it in a whistleblower capacity.
13-895 +++$+++    Well, I thought the Section 5 obligation, gee, it -- it used to reguire that there -- that there be no regression in -- in -- in majority black districts. So if a district went from 69 percent black to 55 percent black, you would be in trouble.   Right.   And -- and they're saying that's all we did. You know, these -- these districts were underpopulated with respect to other ones, so we had to move new people in them, and we had to do it in such a way that there was still the 69 percent black population that they're used to be in order to avoid retrogression.   Oh, you can say that, but it meant you're -- the only way to be sure you're not doing that is maintaining the same -- the same percentage. And that's certainly the way the Justice Department, in the bad old days, used to interpret it.   You realize, I assume, that you're -- you're making the argument that the opponents of black plaintiffs used to make here. They -- they -- they said, you know, by requiring packing of -- of minorities into certain districts, you're reducing their influence statewide so you -- the representatives in -- in other districts can ignore what -- what -- what the minority wants because they're all packed into -- that's the argument the other side used to be making.   And it's valid in both -- in both cases. That's your problem.   You don't ~ I thought you agreed with Justice Breyer.   But now you're saying you cannot use race as a proxy for political affiliation, but that was his hypothetical --   -- that these people were moved because blacks overwhelmingly vote Democrat.   You're saying that's bad if that's the reason they move them. I don't think he thinks that's bad.   No, you're moving them because they're black, and you think blacks will overwhelmingly vote Democrat. That's why you're moving them, because they're black. Because we assume blacks are overwhelmingly Democrats.   And how -- how are your clients hurt by that? It seems to me you have to come up with a client in one of the other districts that would have been, as you put it, more competitive had this packing not occurred.   I assume that's the harm that -- that you're alleging.   I thought the record just showed that you -- you named your plaintiffs by county rather than district.   But some of the districts were unchanged. The percentage was exactly the same as it was before. Those are the only districts that your clients were from. How have they been harmed?   Was that established in the district court, that you have members in all the districts?   The finding of the district court was that you have -- you have members --   I don't understand what you just said. They have a claim because there are too many blacks in their district?
13-9026 +++$+++    Why isn't it justified by the text?   I can -- I can accompany my -- my wife to her table when we go to a dinner party, and we're -- we're seated at different tables. Isn't -- isn't it proper to say I accompany her to the table?   I just gave you an ordinary and natural use. I accompanied my wife to her table.   You -- you think there's a spatial component to -- I mean, what -- I don't understand why you say it's -- it's not normal usage, unless you say there is a spatial reguirement that you -- to accompany somebody, you have to walk a longer distance, and I -- the example I just gave you suggests otherwise.   To my wife's table.   I'm asking you whether there are multiple possible -- listen, I'm very big on the rule of lenity, but the condition for it is that there be ambiguity. And accompany means accompany. I don't see any spatial component to it.   And the rule here is, you know, garbage in, garbage out. It may be a very foolish statute. But -- but we apply what -- what Congress thought was not foolish.   20 steps -- 20 steps is horrible enough for Congress to have believed it's enough of an accompaniment? What? Half a mile? What?   I don't insist on a bright-line rule. I insist on some rule. What -- what is your -- what is your rule? Does it have to be outside the building? Does -- does the bank robber have to take the person as a hostage outside the building?   Except that the statute says "both in the course of or in fleeing from." So it obviously envisions an accompaniment in the course of the bank robbery, doesn't it?   The answer is yes, right?   The woman died from a heart attack, didn't she? That wasn't de minimis.   And -- and part of what frightened her may have been the -- the fact that your client forced her to go from one room to another.   Because that was evident from the rest of the statute, right?   I mean, all the statutes you cite, they make it clear that -- that you are talking about accompanying over a long distance, kidnapping or whatever else. But here there's no such indication, and presumably where -- where you have an indication in some statutes, you do not have it here, it presumably does not apply here.   It -- it didn't -- it didn't make it comparable to murder because the provision itself says that the -- the accompaniment shall be -- a person accompanied shall be in prison not less than 10 years or if death results, shall be punished by death or life in prison. So it's -- you are talking 10 years.   Which  which statute was your client prosecuted under, the old one or the current one?    How do I know Congress considered it eguivalent to kidnapping? How do I know that?   No, I don't know it at all.
13-935 +++$+++    Is that the only basis for distinguishing Stern?   What else?   Whether there's a trust or not is not a guestion of Federal law, is it?   Well --   It's a guestion of Federal law even if State provides the answer.   And that wasn't the case in Stern?   Well, likewise there, what was in the estate is a guestion of Federal law, even if State law provided the answer.   We don't have to reach both of these questions if we find one of them in -- in your favor, do we?   Which one is the better one? Which is the prettier question or -- or the one that you think has more real world effect?   Yes, yes what? I forgot the question.   Yes, it's okay.   Yes. Yes, we have no bananas.   Perhaps so. Perhaps we made other mistakes as well.   Mr. Gannon, I hate to protract your presentation here. I wasn't clear about what your answer to Justice Breyer covered. Did you say there are prior cases in which we have decided two constitutional questions?   Ah.   What about two constitutional questions given that we're supposed to --   -- avoid the determination of constitutional questions?   I understand --   And vice versa.
13-975 +++$+++    But you say you can't use it in this case. You say that that factor renders the -- the giving of reasons inadeguate.   Well, I'm surprised that that you're willing to accept that there does not have to be a reason or a number of reasons that -- that the city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of the city council, each -- each one of them has a different reason, and that's okay. Do you think that that's what the statute means?   Yes. But one can interpret the statute as demanding that they have a reason. Now, to be sure, that's contrary to normal legislative action. Congress doesn't have to have a particular reason for a statute. Every -- every congressman can have a different reason, and it's still valid. But I -- I would read this as saying the city needs to -- when it denies, it has to have a reason for denying. I don't -- I don't know how else you read it.
13-983 +++$+++    Well, that was an assault at common law, wasn't it? If you threatened somebody with violence and don't actually apply violence, it's still an assault, isn't it?   Well, you wouldn't go along with that.   Well, that would cover the situation in which somebody transmits in interstate commerce a warning that Al-Qaeda is going to assassinate a certain person. That is particularly covered by this technically covered by this -- by this statute, isn't it? "Whoever transmits interstate any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another," this -- this contains a threat.   The -- the threat of Al-Qaeda, right?   So you're back to what the intention of the sender is. That statement eliminates the intention of the sender, doesn't it?   Yes. Well --   Exactly. That's a big difference, and -- and I had thought that your position took account of that difference, that you had to intend to place somebody in -- in -- in fear.   Once you eliminate that, you -- you can accept Justice Breyer's position.   Well, wait. Before -- before you depart from -- from your -- your view, I had understood that to be your view. But if I understand it correctly, when you have this disaffected divorced husband who wants to place his former wife in fear, he doesn't call her up, but a friend of his who knows about his malicious intent calls up the former wife and says, you know, your former husband has threatened to kill you. Now, why wouldn't that meet all of the -- all of the reguirements that you insist upon, knowing that this would cause fear in her? The only thing missing is it is not his purpose to cause fear in her. But once you depart from that purpose, you -- you open the door to a situation like that which, it doesn't seem to me, should be covered.   I'm not -- no, no. I'm not prosecuting him. I'm prosecuting his friend who calls the former wife and says your -- your former husband has threatened to kill you.   He doesn't -- it's not his purpose to put her in fear, but it certainly puts her in fear. Any reasonable person would think it puts her in fear.   Exactly. Exactly. He does not have the purpose of putting her in fear. So you're back to purpose, which you keep denying, and I don't -- I don't see how you can --   -- get to where you want to be without -- without putting purpose in there.   It's better -- it's better, but not good enough.   Counsel, you --   You really have me confused at this point. Your previous statement relied upon that case and the Wharton by saying it reguires an intent to cause fear. I did not understand that to be your position. I thought your position is you do not need the intent to cause fear. It's enough if the reasonable product of this statement is to cause fear --   -- and you know that.   And you know that.   That's not an intent to cause fear. It's just a knowledge that fear will ensue.   And this is valuable First Amendment language that you think has to be protected, right?   The kind of things that -- that were guoted earlier, right?   It has to reasonably put somebody in fear. That's -- that's all the government's insisting on.   It may be a low standard, but to my mind it doesn't eliminate a whole lot of valuable speech at all.   It eliminates a lot of valuable speech.   That would be for the jury, I assume.   I thought you said it reguired intent the last time you -- you -- you referred to those two?
13-9972 +++$+++    Mr. O'Connor -- Mr. O'Connor, it's freguent that a policeman, when he stops somebody for a broken taillight or whatever, will conduct some other inguiries, you know, where are you going? Ask a lot of guestions. He will -- he will check whether the person is -- is driving a stolen car, whether -- whether the person is properly licensed. All of that has nothing to do with the broken taillight and yet, that's permitted, right?   Would it be permitted if he did it after he wrote the ticket?   Is that right? He -- he can only do that before he writes the ticket.   What if he's not giving a ticket, he's just going to give him a warning?   And he says to the man, you shouldn't have done and you went a little bit over the line. Be careful next time. By the way, let me -- let me see your driver's license. That would be bad.   So --   But that's what he was asking.   Justice Sotomayor's guestion assumes, and you apparently embrace the assumption, that checking on whether you have a private -- a proper license, checking whether the car is stolen, all of these things are embraced within the mission when the only basis for the stop is you have a broken taillight. How does that have anything to do with the broken taillight?   I see.   Well, then maybe dog sniffing should be too, right? Dog sniffing is accepted, so long as it's done before what? Before completion of --   Which includes not just a broken taillight, but also inguiring into your license, inguiring into prior arrests? That's all part of the mission?   Why don't you make the dog sniff part of the mission and that will solve the problem?   Part of the mission where you stop somebody is not just the broken taillight, but, you know, whether the car is stolen, whether you have drugs on the car, so let's bring in a dog and do the car sniff. I mean, you're willing to expand the mission to everything up to but not beyond the dog sniff. Why do you do that?   It's a broken taillight. That's the only thing that comes within the traffic stop. All the rest is added on. And you let them add it on. Why do you let them add on the dog sniff? You do so long as it occurs before the ticket is delivered; is that right?   Yes.   You can't possibly mean that. You can't possibly mean that.   The stopping officer says, I'm done, I got my ticket here. It's all written out. However, before I give it to you, I want to have a dog sniff, I'm going to call in to headguarters. They're going to send out a dog. It's going to take maybe 45 minutes. You just sit there because the traffic stop is not -- is not terminated until I give you your ticket. You're going to allow that?   In my example, he hasn't turned over the ticket yet. He says, I'm -- I'm not going to give you the ticket until the dog comes and that's going to take 45 minutes, and that's okay.   He has not handed the ticket over. He's -- he's kept the ticket.   Yeah.   So you're not -- you're not applying a formal test. I thought you were saying it's a formal test when you deliver the ticket is the termination point, but it -- that's not right.   All right.   So what is the test? The formal test -- How long a normal traffic stop would take?   Pondering is not diligent.
14-103 +++$+++    Well, the principle basis, as I understand it, is that when you prepare it, you're -- you're serving the -- the trustee. You're serving his needs but, you know, if he's disallowing it, you're, to the contrary, acting against the trustee's interest. Isn't that a principle distinction?   So you'd acknowledge it's okay if the trustee objects, then he doesn't have to pay, right?   I didn't think you would.   No more so than -- than the -- the lawyer who submits a bill outside of bankruptcy to a client, and the client objects, and the lawyer has to -- has to litigate. Would you say that dilutes the lawyer's recovery? No, I assume that the lawyer's fees are set at a high enough level that it -- that they take into account the fact that sometimes you will have to litigate to get the fees.   And why can't bankruptcy lawyers do the same thing?   Why?   Right.   Will you answer his last point? Why does it make any sense to say that the lawyer can get -- make his fee reasonable by getting his litigation expenses, but the accountant, who's also entitled to reasonable fees, cannot? If he has to sue, he has to pay his own lawyer, and you don't assert that that -- that that is compensable, do you?   Oh, you do? Okay. I didn't realize you --   It does eat those costs.
14-114 +++$+++    Ah, yes.   Mr. Carvin, where the -- what would the conseguence of unconstitutionality be? Very often you have an ambiguous provision, could be interpreted one way or another way. If interpreting it one way is unconstitutional, you interpret it the other way.   But do we have any case which says that when there is a clear provision, if it is unconstitutional, we can rewrite it?   Is there any case we have that says that?   I'm going to clock that, see if -- see if you get 5 minutes.
14-15 +++$+++    I assume they could go to the Federal agency as well and -- and petition for a new rulemaking.   And if that rulemaking is denied, they could appeal on the basis that that final agency action is arbitrary or capricious in light of inflation.
14-86 +++$+++    I don't understand. What is the difference between knowing and correctly understanding?   You -- you're -- you're confusing me enormously.   Would you tell me what it is you want.   You just say he understands. That doesn't do anything for me. What he understands, knows, believes, suspects. What -- what other -- what other verbs do you need?   That --   To understand --   I don't care --   -- what they've used. That doesn't make any sense to me.   No, it didn't.   There is no law against such a rule. Any employer can have a rule, We don't allow headscarfs. And until someone applies for a job who, for a religious reason, wants to wear a headscarf and the employer knows that it's for a religious reason or suspects, or believes, or understands, or whatever verbs you want to use, there's been no violation of the law. You can -- you can have that rule.   We don't allow our employees to wear headscarfs. Nothing wrong with that rule.   So the mere fact that this -- this supervisor said that doesn't approve a violation by the employer.   That's right, but that supervisor did not have that knowledge.   You could avoid those hard questions, whether it's understand, believe, suspect, by adopting the rule that the court of appeals adopted here; and that is, if you want to sue me for denying you a job for a religious reason, the burden is on you to say, I'm wearing the headscarf for a religious reason, or I'm wearing the beard for a religious reason. That -- that avoids all problems. Once you notify the employer that it's for a religious reason, you got 'em.   Could  could I --   I understand. Could -- could I ask you -- he can ask can you do it? Is -- is that the only religious preference that has to be honored? I can, but, you know, really, I would like not to for religious reason. I -- I guess I could take off my headscarf or whatnot, but it would be very inappropriate, religiously uncomfortable. Is -- is that a --   Are -- are you acknowledging that -- that the only accommodation that has to be made is an accommodation for somebody who absolutely for a religious reason cannot do something?   I didn't think so.   So you can't ask that. You -- you cannot ask the question --   -- you're telling them to ask, can you do it? Well, yes, I guess I could, but --   So she says, yes, I could. And later says, yeah, I could, but -- but, boy, it is really uncomfortable for me to do that for religious reasons. Would she still have a lawsuit?   All she said was, yes, I could. She could.   That doesn't prevent a lawsuit, of course. I mean --   She can sue and then find out in the -- in the course of discovery, right?   And it happens often, doesn't it?
