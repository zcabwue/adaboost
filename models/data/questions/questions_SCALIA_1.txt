04-1034 +++$+++         Even when it's not a body of water.        A storm drain, even -- even when it's not filled with water, is a tributary. Right?        Okay.        I suggest it's very absurd to call that waters of the United States.                 It's a drainage ditch dug -- you know, dug by the municipality or -- you know, or a gutter in a street.                To call that waters of the United States seems to me extravagant.        What -- what percentage of the -- of the territory of the United States do you believe is -- is subjected to permits from the Corps of Engineers on your theory whenever you want to move dirt, whenever you want to deposit sand?                What -- what percentage of the total land mass of the United States, if you define tributary as broadly as you define it to include?        Every storm drain?      I mean, it's the whole country, isn't it?       All the water goes down to the sea and there's some kind of a drain or -- or a bed that takes the water down there.       You're calling empty ditches -- not unless you call empty ditches land, which I do.       I understand that.        But -- but you -- that's just because this statute happens to refer to wetlands. But under your theory, the Corps of Engineers would have jurisdiction over any land that is part of that tributary system as well.             If any of that land has a deposit of -- of some materials that could leach into or -- or drain into the -- the tributary system, which is to say any gutter, in theory, the -- the Federal Government can regulate it all.                No?       But in 1899, it just said navigable rivers, not -- not every -- every tributary defined to include even storm drains.            Adjacent to what?        Adjacent to a tributary.             Right?            But -- but here's -- here's the fly in the ointment.                 You -- you interpret tributary to include storm drains and ditches that only carry off rainwater.              I mean, it makes an immense difference to the scope of jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers.          I mean, when you talk about adjacent to a tributary, I think, you know, maybe adjacent to the Missouri River or something like that.                      No.   You're talking about adjacent to a storm drain.            Only because I don't know how a storm drain is a water of the United States. That's all.              I mean, all of these terms that you're throwing around somehow have to come within a reasonable usage of the term, waters of the United States, and I do not see how a storm drain under anybody's concept is a water of the United States.       No.     I was referring to a real storm drain. (Laughter.)       Okay?       And some aren't.      But -- but you would sweep them all into the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers.        Well, but that -- but that doesn't follow.          I mean, it is not a principle of law that so long as the object is -- is lawful and within the power of the United States, all means to which even that object are lawful.            That is simply not true. There are various means of stopping that pollution, and it may well be that one of the means, which intrudes too deeply into the State's power to regulate land within their jurisdiction, is not a permissible one. That -- that's not an extraordinary proposition.         I don't see how non-point source pollution is -- is any more remote from what the Federal Government should be able to do to achieve its ends than is a point source pollution that -- that consists of -- of dumping sand on land that has some puddles on it.           I -- that seems to me just as remote.            Though not necessarily as far as storm drains.             It would be enough to -- to say navigable -- you know, non-navigable tributaries that are real -- real tributaries.            It's a very vague indication.              I mean, I -- I agree with you that your argument based on 404(g) is a strong one, but it -- it perhaps is weakened if you believe that in order to stretch to the -- to the limit of Federal jurisdiction, you need a clear statement.                    I certainly wouldn't consider 404(g) -- if -- if the act did not previously include the kind of authority you're arguing for, I would not -- I would not consider 404(g) a clear statement of that -- of that new -- new authority.       So you say that the authority of -- I don't -- I don't even think the Corps has ever suggested this.            The authority of the Corps extends not only to all that you've -- we've been talking about and that you've asserted, but also to lands that, if altered, could have some hydrological connection.       What is -- what is the basis for their doing it?         If there is currently no hydrological connection, there is a berm, there is no -- there is no connection to the navigable waters of the United -- what could possibly be the basis for their asserting jurisdiction?       Yes, I --       A statute could do that.       A statute could do that.            But this statute requires that it be a water of the United States.        And -- and when -- when there is nothing but puddles that are isolated by a berm, even from the storm drain which goes to tributaries, I can't conceive of -- of how you could consider that that's -- you know, at least where it leaks sometimes into the storm drain and went down to a tributary, I think it's an exaggeration, but maybe you could call it a water of the United States.                 But where there's a berm that prevents any water from going even into the storm drain which then goes into a tributary, how can you possibly consider that a water of the United States?        That's not the argument I was addressing.          I'm addressing the argument that in changing the land, you may cause it to --        I'm happy to hear that. That's all I was trying to establish.                   You -- you don't assert that that's an independent basis.

04-1084 +++$+++            Do we know whether you can be a member of that church without being an Indian?         I don't care whose position it is.      The language does not admit of that exception. There's nothing in the language of it that would suggest that exception at all.            What language do you rely upon for that exception?         As a whole, anywhere in it -- give me language anywhere in the whole Treaty that --         -- suggests that exception.         Maybe our Treaty partners are just violating the Treaty.       She's not going to read it, because I asked her for language in the --       -- Treaty.        In --       -- the Treaty --       -- not in the legislative history of the Treaty. [Laughter.]        Can --        Can I make a suggestion as to why, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a compelling State interest to comply with the Treaty?        Because I haven't --        -- it made.         I -- I mean, isn't it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if Congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a Treaty, it may do so?          Now, if this RFRA can trump a statute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a Treaty.       So, compliance --       -- with a Treaty is not necessarily a compelling State interest.       About commentary or travaux, I don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't contradict the Treaty.            Do we have any case where we use the -- les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict the language of the Treaty?       And that's what, it seems to me, is going on here.       I don't know what you mean by that.       You said that before, too.       Right.       Oh, okay.       What about --       I worry about the general proposition we would be adopting if we say, you know, one narrow exception is not a -- doesn't contravene a compelling State interest.            What about -- I assume there is still a Federal law against bigamy that applies in Federal territories.         Now, what if, you know, a small religious group comes forward and said, you know, "We -- our religion requires bigamy.                   There are not a whole lot of us.        We're just a little tiny group.               So, we demand, under RFRA, an exemption from this absolute law.                     Why does it have to be absolute?                It's just a little tiny exception, only a few of us."            At least for now. [Laughter.]
04-1131 +++$+++        Mr. Stewart, you know, you have here a statute in which Congress, with malice aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review of any major personnel actions and does not provide for judicial review of what it had regarded as insignificant personnel actions.                I can understand the position, although I don t agree with it, that the constitutional provision which says Congress can -- can make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant constitutional claims.           But when Congress has gone to the trouble of providing for judicial review of any claims that are significant and just saying any other insignificant action, even though a constitutional violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact it does not harm you that much, we re not going to allow judicial review, what is -- what is wrong with that?       It seems to me that s what Congress has said and -- and you re creating a scheme that simply contradicts what Congress plainly said.       Did any of them involve a situation in which Congress took the pain to separate significant actions from insignificant actions?       I mean, some of them involve deportation and, you know, major -- major actions. This is a case where Congress has -- has carefully tried to say these are major actions for which you should be able to get into the courts.                 And these other things -- you -- you have these administrative remedies, but that s the end of it.        What s the second statute? There s no second statute here.                There -- there is your concession of the fact that there has to be judicial review.        That s what s driving all of this.         And -- and generally speaking, when we find something to be unconstitutional, we don t rewrite a statute so that it will be constitutional.            We just say, you know, there has to be judicial review.        Mr. Stewart, if -- if we re going to tweak the statute, isn t the least possible tweak -- and perhaps not a tweak at all -- simply to consider this a personnel action?        If -- if a decision to order psychiatric testing can be one, why can t a decision to require drug testing be one?        I m not sure it s a tweak at all.      It -- it just depends on -- on what you consider to be working conditions.             And in -- in many contexts, we ve given the broadest possible interpretation to working conditions.       Well, I --
04-1140 +++$+++          You're saying that it allows Rule 11 fees to be imposed --         -- which otherwise wouldn't be imposable.             It seems to me that what cuts against that interpretation is the fact that it does try to set some standard.                 It says, "An order remanding the case may require payment of just cause -- just costs and any actual expenses, including attorneys fees."          Especially the "just costs," that's a standard.          It's not saying, "You can use Rule 11 and apply whatever standard Rule 11 contains."          What's your response to that?       You know, it would really improve the dignity of this Court if we referred to "Piggie Park" as "Newman." [Laughter.]       I suppose that one could assume that to be the congressional intent, if Congress often has such an intent for such substantial imposition of financial liability.                   Do you have any other examples of where Congress has essentially left it up to the district judge, with a broad, virtually nonreviewable -- I guess it's reviewable, but -- to some extent -- but multifactor test, whatever the district judge considers important?       What are --       -- what are some other examples where Congress has allowed this degree of financial liability to be subjected to the discretion of a district judge?        And this is liability for what?       In -- for --         If the -- the broader discretion we give to the district court, the less litigation there is likely to be on this subject.
04-1144 +++$+++          Counsel, Surely not the delay for a quick phone call.             Let's assume New Hampshire sets up a special office open 24 hours a day and this is the abortion judge, and he can be reached any time anywhere.          It takes 30 seconds to place a phone call.         This is really an emergency situation?          I guess if that's the case, the doctor better not put on his gloves.        What about in good faith and with substantial support in sound medicine.        I mean, why should the doctor who is very negligent and doesn't know what he's doing, why should he be protected?        It's just one more condition, good faith is not enough.                    You can have a good faith quack.        I'm sure that's the case with regard to other medical procedures, if you're grossly negligent, it's a criminal offense, I'm sure, in most States.         Then they shouldn't have voted for the severability provision which clearly says if, in one of its applications, it's invalid, the rest can be given effect without the invalid provisions.           I mean, the severability provision really just flatly contradicts your assertion that the New Hampshire legislature wouldn't want this to happen.
04-1152 +++$+++        Oh, where do you find that? In -- it has to be a morally-based, conscience-driven --       I thought we were talking about freedom of speech, not the religion clauses.       What do you --       What do you do about the -- about the cases where we have required colleges to allow some student activities to put forward their views on campus, when other student activities are allowed to do that?         It seems to me that that flatly contradicts the proposition that when you compel an institution to permit somebody else to speak, you are violating that institution's first-amendment rights.       So, you --       -- are saying that --       -- that every time somebody gives as his reason for violating a law that he wants to send a message that he disagrees with that law --       -- that raises a first- amendment question.       Well --            Here's a need.     How about this? We have said in our opinions -- and I am quoting from Rostker versus Goldberg -- "Judicial deference is at its apogee when legislative action under the congressional authority to raise and support armies and make rules and regulations for their governance is challenged."              And that's precisely what we have here.            I don't think it has to do with expertise.             I think it has to do with immense national importance.        Mr. Rosenkranz, could you tell me which elements of your argument rest upon compelled actual speech and which rest upon compelled symbolic speech?          Because the latter, I have to tell you, I'm not very fond of.              What compelled actual speech is imposed on the -- you mentioned something about e-mails, they have to send e-mails to say where the recruiter will be located --        -- is that the compelled speech you're worried about?       Well, that's symbolic speech.        I'm talking about actual speech.         What expression is the university -- real, you know, words - - words -- is the --       -- university --       -- compelled to utter by this legislation?       No, I suppose when you -- when the police knock at the door and say, you know, "I have a warrant," I suppose somebody has to say, "Come in."      Is that compelled speech?           Does that --       Does that -- does that raise a first-amendment problem?           Suppose that a law-school faculty could decide that it does not favor a particular war, and use that as the basis for excluding recruiters, "By allowing this recruiter to come on campus, you are making me speak, in effect, to our students, saying, 'Join the Army and fight the war that we're now engaged in.'"       "And I don't want to do that."        Now --       -- what would be the difference?       Yes, okay --       -- fine.          I'm saying the same thing.       But I'm saying --       -- you would say that the same situation would apply if the university faculty does not favor the particular war that the United States is --       -- engaged in, and, therefore, obstructs the effort to raise --       -- an army --       -- by not allowing them to come on campus.       It's obstruction when you refuse to give them what you give what you give everybody else.       -- fighting a war.
04-1170 +++$+++          Ms. -- Ms. Woodman, you know, I -- I have not, you know, gone along with -- with most of our Walton jurisprudence anyway, but -- but what I have really always thought it demanded was really nothing more precise than that a jury has to be given the opportunity to grant mercy.                    I -- I'm not sure I would describe any of it as any more precise than that.         The jury has to be given the opportunity to say this poor devil doesn't deserve the death penalty.           However you want to put that, you know, you can put the burdens here, the burdens there.                    You can talk about equipoise or not.                  Does the jury have a chance to say this -- this fellow does not deserve the death penalty?           That --         -- and clearly exists under this scheme, it seems to me.                   Any jury that -- that really thinks this person should not go to death can -- can do it.          In fact, you know, I guess the statute does not demand that instruction, but that instruction that says -- what is it?                      The appropriateness of the exercise of mercy can itself be a mitigating factor.           I mean, gee, what -- what else -- what else do you have to do?         Any jury that thought this -- this person did not deserve death would have ample opportunity to give expression to that determination under this scheme.          And therefore, they shouldn't consider mitigating at all, he told them?          Is -- is this mercy instruction always given?               Is that standard?     Is it -- is it, in effect, that -- that mercy is -- is always one of the mitigating circumstances?         Gee, I -- I really don't see what -- what complaint you have then.                    Any jury that -- that thinks this person deserves mercy says, I think he deserves mercy, and that's -- that's a -- a mitigating circumstance that outweighs whatever aggravating circumstances there are.         If the State is --         Who said that?      Excuse me. That -- that description of the statute.         Yes, but it seems to me the statute doesn't really say that, does it?                  But I mean, what the statute says is that if it's in perfect equipoise, the State loses because the State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the -- that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators. It seems to me if a jury sees them in perfect equipoise, the jury would have to say the State has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not outweigh the aggravators.                    What -- isn't that what a jury would have to say?             That's right.   Okay.    And -- and if the jury cannot decide whether the aggravators are outweighed by the mitigators, if they're in perfect equipoise, who loses?             No.   The State loses.     It's the State that has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they are --         Well, how could the issue be pressed?         I mean, it had already been decided by the supreme court.           I mean, what -- what could the State say to the trial court?         You think this -- you think the State has to challenge as unconstitutional a decision of the State supreme court in -- in the lower court, lower State court.       How do you expect the lower State court to come out on that?       That's a little different from an adequate and independent State ground argument. You're -- you're now making a -- a waiver argument.          We -- we don't need a presumption here.           I mean, the -- the only basis for inquiring into severability is the presumed unconstitutionality of the statute.                       I mean, that's the only basis why severability comes up.                      We don't have to presume anything.          It doesn't matter whether it redecided it.            It -- it was the postulate of -- of its -- necessary postulate of -- of its decision in this case, it seems to me.            Kleypas didn't hold that the whole statute was bad.                Kleypas gave a savings construction of the statute, as I recall.       So -- so the State can get mouse-trapped in this way.             In -- in the first case, it doesn't take the case up because not too much has been lost, and then in the second case, the court says, oh, by the way, everything has been lost.                  And you say that we can't review that because -- because the -- the State didn't -- didn't challenge Kleypas at the time.       Well, but that decision in this -- they had no reason to challenge it until the State decided to -- to change it.       I like that. (Laughter.)
04-1186 +++$+++              Well, that -- that would be true if it said the State in which they are -- in which they are respectively located, but it does say of the States.             Yes, so each one could be in many States.              No?       This is not a matter of -- of -- over which the Comptroller has administrative responsibility, is it?           I mean, this is just a matter for the courts as to what court these associations can be -- can be sued in.          And I don't see how the Comptroller has any business in that area.       I mean, I -- I guess he deals with these associations all the time, so we should -- we should listen to him, but -- but he -- he is not authoritative as to -- as to who comes into court, is he?            But the -- the argument here is -- is in the context of deciding which citizen an entity is a citizen -- which State an entity is a citizen of, we normally don't think that entities are citizens of multiple States.                   Just as you wouldn't think if -- if you're asking, you know, where does the Ford Motor Company manage its -- its operations from, you wouldn't think from multiple States. So here when you're talking about citizenship, why doesn't this argument of context cut precisely against you?                We're talking about citizenship.              People aren't citizens of -- of 50 States.        I mean, that -- that's an extraordinary result to reach.            So we should be looking for one State or maybe two States at most.
04-1203 +++$+++        Mr. Schaerr, who's going to be representing some States as amici, will presumably have better information on that subject.       We could say that --       -- in this opinion.       I mean, that would make it happen, wouldn't it?         Mr. Castanias, suppose the Court agrees with you that the response here is not proportionate, and, hence, that the prophylactic aspects of this statute are invalid.                     There remains the fact that the statute covers actual constitutional violations for which you don't need any special proportionality.          Certainly, the Government can allow the States to be sued for constitutional violations. And the plaintiff here claims that some of the acts he's seeking damages for do amount to constitutional violations.           How can we possibly say that that suit does not lie?         It doesn't lie damages here. Can you get damages under 1983?       Against the State?       We're talking about damages against the State.       Under --       -- 1983 --       -- absolutely.        No, no, I mean the portions that go beyond constitutional violations are no good. I'm not -- I'm not going to read it unrealistically so that it only includes constitutional violations.                    But, to the extent that it includes constitutional violations, why isn't that lawsuit perfectly okay?         Well, that just proves that they went too far.          It doesn't prove that, to the extent that it covers a constitutional violation, it's okay.       We will say the excess is bad.       Even if they're bad, why aren't the other ones good?
04-1244 +++$+++         He's not talking about the deciding of issues; he's talking about reversing a judgment.          You don't have to go into what the issues are in order to follow that instruction.                    The judgment is reversed.          And if there were issues that should have been resolved in order to reverse the judgment, and that weren't, it would seem to me that your remedy would not be to say to the Court of Appeals, "Well, the Supreme Court didn't mean what it said," or, "didn't know what it was doing," but, rather, to move for reconsideration here.        Are you saying you couldn't -- you couldn't file a motion for rehearing on the ground that the Court neglected to address four points that were made very -- you made nothing of them in the -- in the argument or in the briefs.             It was almost not considered at all.        You mean that when a judgment is issued that is so clearly, in your view, erroneous, you can't come to the Court and say, "The judgment is erroneous, you forgot to address these issues"?             I hope you can do that in a motion for rehearing.        They would have to say not just that.       They would have to say, "The court did not deal with those four issues, and, therefore, its judgment was erroneous."           They would have to say that in order to -- in order to act the way they did --         -- because our judgment was "reverse."        Well, you say "most favorable to its conclusion," but did the jury conclude that there should be an injunction?        That's up to the judge.        So, I mean, the principle that you interpret a verdict in the manner most favorable to its conclusion has no application here at all.         Excuse me.         You mean it's up -- I don't understand that.             The judge, in order to issue the injunction, becomes a second fact-finder, and he can find four -- he can pick four out of the twelve, perhaps four that the jury had not picked?         So, he can -- he can actually make a finding.           And it -- and it could be that the jury found that eight of them weren't valid, and the judge, in order to issue an injunction, can contradict the jury and say, "You know, I find that other four"?       Let me --       -- let me talk --       -- about the comma.    I don't -- I don't -- I don't understand your argument on that point. I mean, it says, "Whoever, in any way or degree, obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement or any article or commodity in commerce by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires to do so," comma -- that's the comma you're talking about?       -- "or threatens physical violence to any person or property," but it continues, "in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section."             Now, the only thing that this section has, prior to that statement, said to be a violation is obstructing/delaying by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.       "Plan to do anything in violation of this section," which is not just obstructing commerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.            What is -- what meaning do you give to the phrase "in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section"?                     Under your interpretation, you could just drop that -- drop that phrase completely.            But that's not a violation of the section.              "Obstructing interstate commerce" is not a violation of 1951.            -- is obstructing it by robbery or by extortion or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.       If you're --       -- convicted --       -- of the crime, but you cannot be indicted as a separate crime.               This makes it a separate offense.       You're saying we -- you can use it to aggravate the punishment for some other offense, but this does -- this does something quite beyond that.                  It says it is a separate offense.       Mr. Chemerinsky, I -- you said earlier that our -- that we "reversed and remanded."                   That was not in our opinion, though, as it sometimes is, "Therefore, you know, the case is remanded."                It doesn't say that.          Our opinion here just says "reversed."          It just says --          -- "reversed."          I see.      And they interpreted "reversed" to mean "remanded."          I see.          I see.          So, that enabled them to say that what we meant was not "reversed," but "reversed and remanded."          They didn't look at the last line of our opinion, which said "reversed."       It's a broad principle. Whenever a Court of Appeals thinks that we haven't really resolved all the issues in the case, they can ignore our order that says "reversed."
04-1264 +++$+++        Every usury case, for example.         That s very few?      I mean, that s a lot of cases.       What about fraud in the inducement?       You get rid of them after frustrating the arbitration provision, the whole purpose of which is to keep you out of courts. I d like to -- I d like to ask you about your argument on section 2, which --       -- appears at page 3 of the petitioner s brief.           If you want to read it the way you re reading it, you say a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce. You say that has to be a -- a contract that is a valid contract. Well, what do you do about the end of section 2 which says, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract?              That would apply to -- to contracts that are not -- not void but voidable.       So Southland was wrong.            Why?            Why would you make that -- that weird distinction --            -- and treat the first part of it as though it applies across the board to the entire contract, but the last part of it, reading it differently?              I -- I don t understand that.       It seems to me even if you separate it, you still have the language, save upon such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.               Unless you take that language, the reference to contract in section 2, as referring to two separate things, the contract without the -- without the arbitration clause and the arbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2 doesn t make any sense.       Doesn t it -- doesn t it follow from -- from that theory of yours that in every case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not an arbitrator s determination, but a judicial determination that this was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce?       Wow.     So in every -- every case, the person who -- who is being brought to arbitration can say, I deny that interstate commerce is involved in -- in this -- in this contract and I want to have a -- a judicial determination of it.       Well, I mean, that s --         The question isn t whether the court can -- can determine that fact.                      Ultimately, if the arbitrator determines it incorrectly, you can take it to court.          But the question is whether in every arbitration case, you can go immediately to court to have that question of interstate commerce or not determined.           And that would really throw a monkey wrench into the whole system, it seems to me.        Once the case is in the court, of course, the court has to decide that question.          Once it is in the court.             And it was in the court in -- in Prima Paint.                The question is does it have to go first to the court before it goes to the arbitrator, and -- and Prima Paint doesn t decide that question.
04-1324 +++$+++         You think the court "must."        Well, don't you think that's what this court thought?                And, if so, shouldn't we perhaps send it back to see whether, if the court knew that it had discretion, it would have done this?        What if Congress wanted to leave it to the State to waive the statute of limitations provision?           How could it have made that clear?       I mean, I would have thought that if they made it a statute of limitations provision instead of a jurisdictional provision -- I mean, they could have said, you know, "No jurisdiction if it's filed beyond a certain date, and we mean it."                But it put it as a statute of limitation, which normally is waivable. And I would think that that is an indication that Congress thought, "Really, if the State thinks that in this particular case we shouldn't hew to the technicality of the statute of limitation, the State ought to be able to waive it.           Well, it's always a technicality.           What you're saying is, the only time that the State can do that is when the answer to the statute of limitations is unclear.                       And I'm saying sometimes the State may say, "The answer is clear, but doggone it, this is just too picky-picky, too technical in this particular case."        You acknowledge at least this much, or am I incorrect?               And it's important for me to know that.        You acknowledge at least this much, that if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be saying that the court "must" do this so that the court was not really considering all factors in the exercise of its discretion, we would have to remand.        All right.        Excuse me.      From what you just said, I take it that means that even when the State is unwilling to change its mind and says, "No, we would still prefer not to assert the defense," you would allow the court to impose it.        The answer --        -- is yes.
04-1327 +++$+++           It's not what the court said, though.           The court didn't -- did -- whatever the court said, it clearly did not say just looking at the third party guilt evidence by itself, it's not -- it's not trustworthy.           Whatever else it said, it didn't say that.          Okay.     Yes.   Now, you say that's true.           Now, it may well have been true, but that -- we're -- we're --          That's right.         And as I recall, the trial court did say that this was pretty persuasive evidence but for the fact that you had to exclude some of it because that there was no exception to the hearsay rule.       Didn't he say that?         He said more than that.        I think he said it was --            Well --            Your friend will tell us what he said.         Mr. Zelenka, do you agree that all 49 other States do not look at the -- at the weight of the prosecution's case when making this decision?        Excluding the confession. Excluding the confession.        Has anybody else looked at the evidence on both sides?        Other States I mean.    Other States.            Why wasn't it in the baby- shaking case?            Why was there no credibility determination made in the baby-shaking case you just described?             Didn't -- didn't you have to conclude that the evidence concerning the time of death was -- was credible, was accurate?        Mr. Johnson, your -- your citation of the -- of the portion of the -- of the trial court opinion, which says that there was no corroboration of the -- of the confession, that was not stated in -- to say, and therefore, the confessions were weak evidence.              That point was made in order to say, therefore, the confession cannot be admitted because the -- the rule was it's hearsay, but hearsay that's corroborated can be admitted.                      So I think you're misdescribing the --
04-1329 +++$+++            More often than not, it doesn't.       But the -- the only issue is who has to prove that.           I mean, you -- you could find out who their customers are in -- in discovery and -- and go to their customers and then, you know, show that all of the customers are dissatisfied and wouldn't buy -- wouldn't buy the machine -- wouldn't buy the ink were it not that they needed the machine.                  I mean, it's just a question of -- of who has to prove it.                  That's all.       We don't know how many people paid -- paid off the plaintiff.                 We -- you know, frivolous litigation becomes evident only when it proceeds far enough that it's -- it's reported. What -- what I assume would happen most often is that the -- the person who has the patent would just say it's just not worth the litigation.                 Here.   Go away.       We don't know how much of that there is.       We're not even sure, are we, Ms. Sullivan, that -- that you can extend, assuming that there is market power in the patent -- we're not really sure that you can extend it through tying.               I mean, there's -- there's dispute among the economists even on that question.       You could probably say that in every -- in -- in every antitrust case where -- where the defendant is -- is alleging a -- a monopoly on the part of the plaintiff.              It's almost always the case that the plaintiff knows -- knows more about his business than the defendant does.                It's not distinctive here, it seems to me.
04-1332 +++$+++ 
04-1350 +++$+++                 You're right about that.               Well, the claim goes beyond that.   Your claim goes beyond the Asano combination and in your brief you, you, you discuss the case as though your, your limited claim 4 just relates to this invention that you, you -- nobody would have thought of using the Asano pedal in the Ford car given the limited space available and so forth, and therefore, this was really an invention.        But that's not the claim.                The claim is simply combining the, any pedal, the Asano pedal or any other one with the, with the automatic electronic sensor.              But why Asano?              You're the one that's standing up here making that argument.                     They're not doing it.               You say its test is inclusive.   I would say its test is meaningless.                 They have essentially said, our test simply reduces to what, what your opponents in this litigation say.                 If you think that's being inclusive, you know -- it doesn't add anything whatever to -- to the -- to the question, would a person of the ordinary skill in this field have conceived of this idea.                Or anything else.                So why don't you say that?                It is -- I agree with the Chief Justice.     It is misleading to say that the whole world is embraced within these three nouns, teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and then you define teaching, suggestion, or motivation to mean anything that renders it nonobvious.     This is gobbledygook.                  It really is, it's irrational.                It produces more patents, which is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire patents, not to get patent applications denied but to get them granted.    And the more you narrow the obviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns, the more likely it is that the patent will be granted.                Excuse me.        You keep coming back to Asano.    Why do you keep coming back?                  Your claim here does not say anything about Asano.                I think they happened to use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on. But I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody would have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it on Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical accelerator mechanism.              And in the last year or so, after we granted cert in this case after these decades of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it up.                But the claim doesn't require that.
04-1360 +++$+++         So, you -- so, you think it's possible that the defendant could argue that the evidence should be excluded because, "Had he knocked and announced, I would have run to the toilet and flushed it down, rather than" --        -- "answering the" --        Well, why not?        That's causal.
04-1371 +++$+++            The Government doesn't say that "all" are covered.            The Government acknowledges that there are some actions that could still be brought in State court.           So -- it's so counterintuitive.           As the Government points out, these holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.        And why --        -- why the Government would want to police the one, and let the other, you know, proliferate, seems very strange to me.         No, because they -- I mean, the argument made by the Government: "Of course not, because the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this congressional legislation."               They didn't exist, before; and they've become common, afterwards.                     Now -- you know, I -- you can say --       -- that they --       I thought that there were -- well, never mind.           What if I choose not to complain about my buying, I just choose to complain about my holding?            It's true, I was harmed because I jumped in. And that's one harm.             But it's an entirely separate harm that I was induced to hold it --        -- by these continuing misrepresentations.          Why can't that part of the suit be brought in State court?        It is?      Okay.   So, you --        -- you --        -- you agree --        -- you agree that a buyer --        -- who -- whose purchase is excluded, can nonetheless sue --        -- in a State --        No, no, no, no.      You bought --        -- in reliance --        -- on the fraud --        Yes.        Why?        Why?     I have --        -- a buying claim, and I have a holding claim.         Why do --        What is there in the statute that says the two have to go with each other?        Where?        Well, I'm not making --        -- a buying claim.   I -- and there's nothing in my complaint about my buying the stock. I say --        -- "I was induced to hold the stock by these representations that occurred in February, March, April, and May.           I bought, in January, also in reliance on fraud, but I'm not complaining about that."       But they are --       As a practical matter, my damages from the holding may be much greater than my damages from the initial purchase.               And you're saying, "Tough luck, Charlie.         You bought a month too soon -- or a month too late.        You should have brought -- bought before the fraud."       Mr. Frederick, it seems to me that the language "in connection with," you know, whether it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the statute meant, is at least ambiguous.                And, if that's the case, why shouldn't we be guided by the Securities and Exchange Commission's determination, under Chevron, Mead, you know, anything but --         The --         Have we not given any weight to SEC determinations, as to its interpretation, where civil actions are involved?           I'm surprised at that.         Yes.       I agree with that presumption against preemption, where the question is, Does this Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption, accidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the presumption makes sense.           But here, you have a statute, the whole object of which is preemption.               And I'm not sure that what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the language its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on either side of the scale.
04-1376 +++$+++           And those --          And those provisions are specifically recited to apply only to reentrants after the effective date.        You don't want to --        You don't want us to decide it on that ground, do you, so that all future cases you'll have to decide whether he came in before '94 or after '94, right?       Did you say '84 or '94?        I couldn't --       All right.       Can't imagine that.       I say, I cannot imagine that.       No.       And even if he was, that was waivable.       Just as he doesn't automatically get admitted because he's married, does he?       That's discretionary, as well.       So, it's --       -- one discretion --       -- and another discretion.       Or, put more starkly, if I continue to violate the law for 7 years, I can count on this kind of treatment.           That's an odd reliance interest.       I'm not sure that gives the other side the -- you know, the benefit of their argument.         I think what they're arguing is not just that it was deleted, but that it was not replaced by -- whether "before or after," and then filling in the date of IIRIRA, rather than the date of the INA.            I have -- nobody thinks that they would leave in June 27, 1952, but why wouldn't they have substituted, for that, the date of this new legislation, the date of IIRIRA?               I think that's the point he's making.       And isn't there something to that?       Just getting rid of old language that was no longer --       -- or intentionally not adding new language.
04-1414 +++$+++         Mr. Reichel, it -- it seems to me it's part of your case that the probable cause must be in existence at the moment the warrant is issued and that the magistrate cannot take into account the passage of time.          Are you -- Suppose that -- that policemen apply for a -- a warrant in Manhattan which is to be served in Brooklyn, and it's going to -- it's going to take half an hour to get there.           Everybody knows it's going to take half an hour.          And the probable cause that they come up with is they know that this mob leader is going to be in this apartment between 6:30 and 6:45.                 Okay? And they present the warrant to the magistrate at -- at 6 o'clock.          It will take half an hour to get to Brooklyn.         The magistrate knows that when it's served, the mob leader will be in this apartment.                 Can that -- can that warrant issue?        Right, and -- and likewise, it -- it would work the other way.                  If the magistrate had the same facts, the -- the mob leader is going to be there between 6:30 and 6:45, and the warrant is presented to him at 6:30, he would have to decline it because he knows by the time it's served, it's -- it's going to be gone.          Right?        So the magistrate is always looking to the condition when -- when the warrant is executed, and that's all that's happening here.                  There is probable cause to believe that this person will be receiving contraband.           There is probable cause to believe it because he sent for it and it was mailed to him.      It's just a matter of waiting till it gets there. There is probable cause to believe that he will receive it.              And all you're doing is predicting in the future, saying the probable cause doesn't exist now, but it exists when the warrant will be executed.                   I don't see -- I don't see any real difference between that and the -- and the mob leader example I just --            No, but it's probable.       At the time that he issues the warrant, it is probable that this person will be receiving contraband because they showed, you know, this guy sent for it.                He sent for the -- these child pornography films in -- in a -- you know, a Postal Service rouse, and we mailed it to him.      It's probable that he's going to be receiving it.            Can I --       -- can I take you through my -- a variation of my earlier hypothetical?              You say that the magistrate can issue the warrant at 6 o'clock, although he knows that there really won't be the probable cause until 6:30.             You say that would be valid.       He could issue it in Manhattan knowing that it wouldn't be served in -- in Brooklyn until 6:30. What if the magistrate specified that out of an abundance of caution?            It's just the same case, but he writes on the warrant, this warrant is not to be served until 6:30.        Does that make it invalid? Whereas, it was valid before, it's not valid if he -- if he says I am anticipating what will be the situation when the warrant is executed.              He says it explicitly, it can't be served until 6:30.               Does that make it bad?       Doesn't it strike you as -- as strange that it's perfectly okay if he issues it at 6 o'clock, knowing that it'll be -- won't -- that there isn't probable cause now, but there will be at 6:30 when it will be served.           You say that's perfectly okay. But if he says it on a warrant, not to be served until 6:30, it suddenly becomes bad.           Oh, I see.        So -- so you say so long as you say something as clear as 6:30, that's okay.       It cannot be served until 6:30.          I mean, the conversation is not occurring right now.               The magistrate has to say in the future, when this warrant is executed, the conversation probably will be occurring.                      Right?   And so also here.            You know, the -- the receipt is not occurring now, but on the basis of all of the evidence before me, I think that that receipt will be occurring.       Doesn't the Government concede this point?         I had thought the Government conceded that this warrant would not have been validly executed if they went in before the triggering event. Otherwise, there's no purpose in putting in the triggering event.        Maybe we'll have to get the Government to -- to state that explicitly, but that -- that's my understanding, that they acknowledge this warrant would not have been validly executed if they went in before the triggering event occurred. If that's not the case, I agree.         I don't know why we took the case. (Laughter.)       So who --       So who, what, and where includes when, but it doesn't include how.               Right? Where -- where do you derive this proposition?          Of course, all -- this whole argument begs the question.              It -- it assumes that the particularity requirement includes time, not only who, what, where, but also when.              Right?         I mean, you -- you acknowledge that if you're wrong about that, if you're wrong about the fact that who, what, and where automatically includes when, the argument you've just made doesn't get anywhere.        I understand that's your argument, but you agree that if -- if that argument is wrong, you're done.        Well, and they -- and they found other -- other videotapes besides the one that had just been delivered, didn't they, in the course of the search?
04-1477 +++$+++            I'm not even sure it protects that minority.               I think there are a lot of people who won't be home when the -- when the postman comes with the -- with the registered letter, but there are very few who -- who won't take the trouble to -- to pick it up.            I mean, it may be --        But isn't there a second purpose for -- for sending it certified mail?                And that is, it assures that it doesn't get lost.                I think they track it closer.        They can tell you where the letter is.     I think each post office has to record that they've received it and so forth.        Whereas if you just sent it regular mail, it may have been lost.        This -- this assures that it reaches the destination.        Your -- your friend said that the $80,000 comes from the fact that it -- at the -- at the auction, it -- the opening bid is one-quarter of the fair market value.             He said something like that.        Well -- well, was the opening bid $20,000?          So it was at least one-quarter of the --        I see.
04-1495 +++$+++          Mr. MCCartan, how does -- how does your standard work?               The same question I asked Mr. Kneedler.          The -- the test you would propose is whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution would have been brought anyway?         Right.        No.    I think they would say absolute immunity, not qualified.                 I -- I think they're saying if there's probable cause, the game is over.                   No -- no qualified --        This wasn't addressing -- this wasn't -- didn't involve prosecution, though.                  It didn't involve unlawful prosecution.        It -- it was a suit against a prison.        No, but -- but we treat prosecutions quite differently.                We do not give, for example, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as we give absolute immunity to prosecutors.        This is a specially dangerous area in which to allow litigation.        Mr. MCCartan, I -- I still don't entirely understand what you would want the Government to prove under your system in order to -- in order to -- to win this case.               They would have to prove what?       That -- that --        And it would not be enough to show that the prosecution would have gone forward anyway.        Yes.        Right.        You see now in -- in the employment cases where -- where somebody is dismissed for a -- a racially discriminatory reason and -- and you have to prove that the same action would have been taken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with the discriminatory motive whether that person would have taken that action anyway.               Whereas here, the person who brought the prosecution is not in this case. It's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor. I don't know how that person could -- could possibly establish that the prosecution would have been brought anyway.        It wasn't up to him.        It had nothing to do with --        Do you think the defendant can subpoena the prosecutor?        Why?     I thought the prosecutor had absolute immunity.        You say he -- he can't be brought into court to defend his own -- his own judgment, but he can be brought into court when -- when an investigator is sued in -- in order to take his testimony as to what would have happened?        Well, he may have done it voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he could be subpoenaed, when -- when he has absolute immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a suit against somebody else.               It seems to me a very strange kind of a --        Well -- well, surely the prosecution --        Surely the prosecution would go ahead if there were probable cause.                 No?   No?   I mean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.        You mean to say if there was -- if there was perfect probable cause for the prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its tracks by -- by an allegation of the First Amendment violation?        Mr. MCCartan, what was the 1887 case or 1880 --        I thought you said Armstrong.        I thought it was --        Right, because the prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information from other people.        And you're not going to throw out the prosecution just because this one piece of information was bad.        Neither -- neither does absolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish between whether the prosecutor was acting just illegally or just acting unconstitutionally.             I mean, yes.        You apply the same rule there.        Yes, well, your -- your point that -- that there -- there has to be a difference between whether there's a constitutional violation or not in this context seems to me not well taken because we don't make that distinction in the context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor. We don't say he doesn't have absolute immunity when -- when he's been guilty of a constitutional violation.        I wouldn't worry a lot about that, Mr. --
04-1506 +++$+++                What -- what incentive does she have to cooperate in that later action?                          And isn't it the fact that she would have a disincentive to cooperate if she's going to have to reimburse the insurance companies for any additional compensation that they pay?       Well, it -- but -- but don't some of the insurance policies require that if the insurance company, which has settled the first claim, ends up paying -- paying additional money, that that -- that that amount of money would be the -- the responsibility of the -- of the claimant?       So that's a disincentive on her part.         She doesn't want the insurance company to lose any more money.       Well, it seems to me that that's a very strange system for the Federal Government to set up and to -- to -- I mean, to -- to subsidize -- to reward the failure of the -- of the Medicaid benefit -- beneficiary to cooperate.               There's a statutory responsibility for her to cooperate, isn't there?       And she didn't do that here because she just went ahead and settled without -- without giving the State notice.       Really.       I mean, the State is a party to the proceeding, and she goes ahead and gets the proceeding dismissed without even telling the State, and that -- that isn't included in the -- the responsibility to cooperate?       The complaint -- the -- the intervention by the State claimed only a lien?                Is that what the --       -- document claimed? Intervention --          Yes, but the -- the other thing that you're -- you're dividing that against is not liquidated.          And nobody -- I mean, the -- where there's room for -- for compromise is certainly in the pain and suffering part of a settlement, not in the medicals.            I mean, the medicals are a given in any settlement I've ever heard of.                  There it is, black on white.       This is how much was paid.          That's the compromise. Unless there's a -- you know, a compromise on whether there's liability or not, but -- but whether, if there is liability, this amount is owing, that's -- that's a given for the medicals.              Isn't it?       Wouldn't -- wouldn't the insurance company have to worry about the same problem? That is to say, even if it's not your problem by reason of our coming out the way you would like us to, wouldn't it remain a problem for the insurance company so they could not enter into any settlement until they knew that the State would go along with -- with the division between medicals and -- and other damages? That -- that's what I don't understand.                Doesn't it become a problem for the insurance company to somehow bring in the State in the process of the settlement?        Right.        Okay, but once -- once the -- once the -- the foolish insurance company figures out that that is what is going to happen, future settlements will be very difficult I would gather.            And your argument is if it is six in one, half -- half a dozen in the other, we should do it your way because that's what the text of the statute says.       You're talking about the Federal statute --       -- not the State statute.       The State statute clearly goes beyond that and says --       But I assume the State -- the State tries to get around that by saying it never -- never became the property of your client, that by reason of the assignment provision, all choses in action automatically vest in the State, causes of action arising out of transactions in which there's a claim for Medicaid compensation.       But you say -- you say they can't do that because, at the time the accident occurs, you don't even know that there's going to be a claim --
04-1527 +++$+++          I must say, this --         -- this doesn't seem to me normal usage.          I don't think if -- you know, if you see a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the rapids of the Colorado "discharge" into the Colorado. You're usually talking about a different body of water. You could say the Green River discharges into the Colorado.         Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you know, "The waterfall on this river discharges into the river."        It's part of the river.           But if it were a waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you would then say that, you know, "the waterfall discharges into the Colorado," or whatever river it enters at that point.            It seems to me very strange to talk about a river discharging into itself.            But the --            -- the issue is not whether there is a discharge, as I see it. 	 The issue is whether there's a "discharge into the river."                  And one does not usually speak of the "river discharging into itself."          That -- it's the "into" that's the crucial part.       How do you distinguish this case from Miccosukee, if I'm saying it right? -- yes, Miccosukee --            -- where we had, you know, a pumping of water from one polluted body into another, and it was held -- we held that that was not a discharge?            It --            That's right.            But the crucial --            -- word was "discharge." The reason we held it was not covered is not because there was no pollutant.                It was clear that there was a pollutant.             But we held there was no discharge.        Because there was no discharge of a pollutant.              There were pollutants in - - on both sides.         That -- I think that was conceded in the case.         The reason that the case came out the way it did was that we held there was no discharge of a pollutant.        Wasn't it conceded that there was a pollutant -- that a pollutant was involved in that case?        So, what must have been the difference was that there was no discharge.        There was no discharge of anything.         It was clear that if there was a -- if there was a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.            Well, only if you assume that letting out the same water into the same river is pollution.             It seems to me you're begging the question.            You --        If there were a discharge of something into the river, you'd be able to move against it.     But the question here is whether there's any discharge into the river when you stop the river and then let the same river out.            Are they maximums or minimums?            I expect that they're minimums.            Well, any significant obstruction in the river amounts to a -- creates a discharge.            Indeed, if it's a small enough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying sideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a discharge into the waters of the United States.                       I find that peculiar.        Well, it depends on how big the river is, doesn't it?         Section 402 uses "discharge" in the same sense, I assume.         Why doesn't it?         Yes --         It is -- it is broader.       But if -- the discharge of a pollutant into the same body of water does not constitute the addition of a pollution -- of a pollutant.                It obviously is the addition of a pollutant.             The only reason you could say that taking it from one -- pumping it from one polluted body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant, which is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for saying that is that there has been no discharge. There's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to the -- to the other body of water.                    The only thing you can say is, there hasn't been a discharge.                   It's -- because it's the same body of water.          If, in Miccosukee, liquid of the same composition had been taken from another body of water, and from -- not the body of water that was adjacent and which we held was the same body of water - - with the same composition, and that had been added, do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same way?          Really?         That you could take pollutants from a different body of water and add it to an already polluted stream?                 I thought that was clear that that's not the case.           Exactly.           Because if it was one body of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of water, it was bad, right?           But it would add pollutants to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent body or whether it comes from some distant body.                        The only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did not qualify is -- not because there no addition of pollutants.            There would be an addition of pollutions from a distant lake, and you -- we'd be able to hold a person liable.            The only reason there was no addition here was that there was -- there was an addition here, but there was no discharge, because it was the same body of water.           And I --           -- it seems to me that's --           -- what you have here.
04-1528 +++$+++         To the extent that Vermont legislators can be bought off by $51? (Laughter.)        But that's the limit you've placed on -- on contributions.        I mean, the -- you know, if -- if you accept more than $51, you're -- you're likely to have your vote determined by that.        Then why -- why the $50 limit?       It certainly isn't based on the corruption --          It shows that on average. It doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is where the -- where the shoe pinches.        That's just what I said. Your figures show that the average spending is below, but that's not what's significant.                    What's significant is what Justice Breyer posed, where -- where there is a contested race and -- and some new candidate wants to unseat somebody who's been in there for years.                    That's -- that's where the shoe pinches.        Did he have a primary?        That's another feature of -- of this scheme that I find quite puzzling.                You get the same expenditure limit for the election cycle whether you go through a primary or not.                What an advantage that is for the incumbent.          If the burden is on the candidate to establish that -- that somebody's expenditure is independent and shouldn't be counted against his expenditure limit.          A presumption, which means the burden, to go forward and show the opposite, is on him.      Right?          And the money that he spends in overcoming that presumption is charged against his expenditure.           Isn't that right?        The other side says the opposite.         I'll ask them whether that's --        And thereafter, all the -- all the candidate has to say is in an affidavit, no, it wasn't coordinated, and then the burden is on the State to show that it was.        Okay, the opposing candidate or the State.        No, but I -- I thought that the point was that the public mistrusts their representatives because of large donations, and I thought the point being made was, well, if that's the case and the public sees that this fellow has gotten a $10,000 donation, the public will say this -- this fellow is in that -- is in that corporation's or that person's pocket.        And I won't vote for that person.        You -- you don't have to show that -- out of the mouth of the candidate, that -- that he voted for the bill because he got $10,000.                The mere fact that it's on the public record that he got $10,000, if -- if what you say is correct, that -- that people are worried about, the -- the corruptive effect of such donations, people should logically vote against that candidate who accepts so much money.         I thought -- I thought what that case said and what many of our other cases say, with regard to expenditures in particular, is that you're not talking about money here.                     You're talking about speech.          So long as all that money is going to campaigning, you're talking about speech. And when you say you don't need any more speech than this, that's a very odd thing for -- for a -- a United States Government to say.                     Enough speech. You don't need any more than this.                     And that's the reason the expenditure limits, as opposed to contribution limits, were regarded quite differently in Buckley and I think should still be regarded differently today.         You're constraining speech.               It's not money you're constraining.               Contribution limits, you're constraining money, but when you say you can't expend more than this on your campaign, you're saying, no, no, no, this is enough speech.                    We're going to -- we, the State, are going to tell you how much you should campaign.        That's very unusual in -- in American democracy.        Limit the contributions.        That solves that problem. Limit the contributions.            But you want to limit expenditures, even if it's the person's own money.                     No possibility of corruption.                   You're saying, no, this is enough speech.            We don't want to hear any more from you.      We, the State, will tell you how much campaigning is enough.             That's extraordinary.
04-1544 +++$+++         But it isn't probated. That's -- it is, indeed, a will substitute.                  The whole purpose of doing it is to avoid probate.        Was it an estate plan or a will?        I mean, you -- you -- you're stretching the probate concept from determining whether the will is valid or invalid and who inherits under the will to also determining what goes into the probate estate, that is, the insurance policies, the trust, and so forth.         That to me is -- is something quite different from probating a will.        But that -- but that's res judicata.         I mean, that -- that isn't necessarily a -- an application of -- of any probate exception.        You say that, but that case doesn't say that.        What -- what case do you have that says that?         But the mere fact that you have jurisdiction to say something does not mean that if -- if some other court says the same thing first, you won't be bound by that.
04-1581 +++$+++        You think Congress has the power to prohibit any First Amendment contact -- conduct that might have an impact on the election?               I mean, is that the criterion for whether it -- it can be prohibited?           What was the bright line rule that -- that you think the -- the opinion established?             I thought the bright line rule was whether it's an issue ad or -- or, rather, a phony issue ad.         I thought that was the -- the line that -- that the opinion was trying to -- to draw.              You -- you say that the opinion drew the line between what?                All issue ads are out?        No issue ads during the -- the blackout.        No --        Oh, of course, I know.        Within -- within the framework of the statute, you think the clear line that is established by the opinion is no issue ads without this special funding during the blackout.               You think that's what the opinion says?       Why does it speak about sham issue ads?       Why did you say there were 7 percent of these that -- that are probably okay?           I -- I deny the first thing, that it's easy to do issue ads without naming the candidate.          The -- the point of an issue ad is to put pressure on -- on the candidate that you want to vote your way.         Without -- without telling people to call -- not the candidate -- the -- the incumbent that you want to vote your way -- without telling people to call the office of that incumbent, you're not doing very much.       General Clement, you -- you've pointed out the difficulties, but I don't know any other area where we said, well, you know, the -- the -- when you're dealing with important -- important freedoms, important guarantees, where we shrug our shoulders and say, well, the only way to accomplish what the Government wants to do is to ride right -- right over those guarantees.              I mean, we say, we -- we cannot bust up this -- this drug conspiracy unless we use warrantless searches.            So, you know, whatever it takes.       We don't -- we don't operate that way.         And here, you're -- you're dealing with a very fundamental guarantee --       -- the -- the right which I think applies to corporations, as well as to anybody else, and for individuals to associate with one another to bring to bear influence on the legislative process. That's a fundamental guarantee.               And it doesn't satisfy me to say, well, there's no other way to stop people from criticizing incumbents during -- during the election blackout period.            Maybe you can't do entirely what you want to do.
04-1618 +++$+++           Mr. Hart --          Mr. --         Well, core -- core government functions isn't -- isn't the test either.                      I mean --         -- you know, the Federal Government and I think some States gave -- gave railroads the power to condemn land.                     Did that make railroads sovereigns entitled to sovereign immunity?                      I don't think so.         So the mere fact that -- that your county is exercising some, quote, core government functions, that -- that doesn't -- doesn't get you there.          It wasn't sovereign immunity.         It was -- charities had immunity until very recently.         Some States still had it when I was in law school.        You couldn't sue a charity for tort.          What are you relying on in the Georgia constitution?               It doesn't mention counties, does it?         It just says except as specifically provided in this paragraph, sovereign immunity extends to the State and all of its departments and agencies.          There can be no -- no -- well, I assume you have a -- a tort -- tort claims act that waives sovereign immunity in some circumstances.          But apart from that, you can't sue counties in tort.           Well, that's bridge immunity, not sovereign immunity.                   I mean --           -- it doesn't come -- it doesn't come within the Federal Constitution.           Well, no, I'm not talking about textually.            I'm talking about in structure. There's nothing in the structure that has anything to do with bridges.          If it wishes.      If it wishes.          The State can pay my damages if it wishes.            It just doesn't happen to have a statute to that effect right now.               But I mean, that -- surely, that doesn't -- doesn't --          That was an old Fifth Circuit case --
04-1704 +++$+++        Counsel, could I ask about the ancillary doctrine?           You say the case you cite to establish it is Flast versus Cohen.                    Was the doctrine discussed in Flast versus Cohen, or are you relying simply on the fact that Flast versus Cohen involved both an Establishment Clause and a free-exercise challenge, and the Court only discussed the Establishment Clause challenge?       Okay.      I --       -- I had not --       -- recollected that footnote.         I will -- I will find it.             I don't read footnotes, normally. [Laughter.]       What about the fact that a State has a lower income tax or a lower property tax than any other State in the Union?                 Does that violate the Commerce Clause because it induces businesses to --          The only one who gets the advantage of the lower -- the lower income tax rate and the lower property tax rate is someone who is located in the State.            It's exactly the same.          I told you, you have to locate -- you'd have to locate in the low-tax State to get advantage of the low -- of the low tax.            Likewise, a business that does not locate in Ohio is not subject to the -- to the higher Ohio tax, which has been reduced for them.       I mean, they're --       -- they're exempt from it entirely, which is even better, I suppose.       Was the legislation that established this tax benefit -- was it controversial? Were there those who opposed it as a giveaway to --       Well, they --       I have -- I will take judicial cognizance of the fact that such proposals are sometimes politically controversial.                   Isn't that the place to fight out this thing?               Isn't your basic objection here that you don't agree that a State should give tax credits to business, and that's something that, you know, is in the political arena, and let the people fight it out?       Why should that be an issue that a court should decide?       Yes, but they're -- what our opinions hold are that there are some matters of producing the same result as a cash subsidy --       -- that are no good, but there are other matters that are perfectly okay.       And the mere fact that it has the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem, as far as the Commerce Clause is concerned.                    And what you're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that effect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in Ohio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's relieving, from a tax that applies to both in-State and out-of-State businesses, only in-State business. That's -- that was the Hawaii case, and all the other cases you cite.          But what your argument here is that the mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the Commerce Clause.          And I don't know --        -- any case --        But that tax did apply to out-of-State businesses --        -- and they got no reduction --        -- right?       A lot of money in building homes.
04-1739 +++$+++        What about changing other people's behavior?        Your -- your assertion that it does no good is based upon the fact that it has not altered the behavior of these people who are in the unit.                   But what about other people who don't want to get thrown in the unit?         I mean, don't you have to look at the deterrent effect?        And -- and is it easy for you to say that the -- that -- that the in terrorem effect of being deprived of -- of literature, television, or whatever has not induced other people to shape up?       Well, I think it is.       Are you going to -- are you going to compare that to writing paper and -- and to -- to the Jewish Advocate or whatever it is?              I mean --       -- it seems to me a perfectly reasonable line.        Of course, I could say the same thing about going to jail, I mean, at all.        You know, I could say whether I'm there 23 hours or all or not --        -- it's enough of an incentive that I -- that I don't want to go to jail. There's -- there's incentives and there's incentives.
04-373 +++$+++        A cure --       A cure of --       Sorry, go on.       A cure of what?    That's what --       -- it seems to me, a lot of this discussion has come down to.           What are you curing?     Are you curing involuntariness of the confession, or are you curing the police badgering?         I thought that we were just trying to cure the badgering and then let the voluntariness of the confession be decided as voluntariness is normally decided, for which purpose you would take into account that he's been -- erroneously said he was charged with murder, or whatever.       You're not helping --       -- defendants, you know.       In some cases, you are not helping defendants.       Sometimes, a defendant, after he talks to his relatives, might conclude, "Boy, you know, I'd better cooperate with the police and get a lesser sentence." But you're saying that can't happen.               Once --       -- once the police make a misstatement, he can never come forward and say, "I want to confess."      What was the quote from the SG's brief?      I didn't --       And what did they say?       Maybe they said that.         I'd be surprised if they said that.       Yes, if there was a judicial finding that any statement given was --       -- coerced.       We're talking about the confession being coerced, that the statement given was coerced --       -- not that his decision to talk to the police was coerced.       Yes, we're --       -- only talking --       -- about what the SG has conceded.       He has conceded that if the -- if it is found by the court that the statement given was a --       -- coerced statement, in that event, it would be unusable for any purpose.       Mr. Ravenell --       -- let me tell you the problem -- the problem I have in the case --       -- and with your reliance on the trial court's findings.          I do not see how the fact that he's -- he's there in the cell in his underwear, the fact that he's 17, the fact that he thinks, and has been led to believe, erroneously, that there's a death penalty in the offing, has anything to do with the question that Edwards asks, which is whether the police, or this individual, initiated the conversation.       That is the issue in these cases --       -- whether the police initiated the conversation that produced the confession.       No, I don't think so.    I think they go to whether the confession he gave was voluntary, but I don't see how they have anything to do with whether he initiated the conversation.
04-433 +++$+++        The customers, employees, and doctors, as I recall.            It was --       -- not just customers.          So there is that kind of connection that -- that your -- your colleague was -- was referring to.          But here -- here, the intimidation was -- was not directed to your customers. I mean, it seems to me that's a -- that's a totally different situation.            Had -- had your customers been defrauded, that would be a -- your customers, but you -- there -- there was nothing directed specifically at the customers of your store.           What was it?           I thought they were just cheating the State.             What was specifically directed at the customers of your store?           Oh, that's -- that's good, not bad.         I mean, you know.        Mr. Roddy, I thought that the way you got out of this problem was what your opponent has called careful pleading.                   I thought that -- that what you were saying was that your client was targeted, that other competitors were not targeted, that this is something of a family -- both of these companies are owned by the same family and there's some bad blood.          Is -- is that part of the background of this?        Okay.        I thought it was part of your complaint that -- that the business here was going after your client in particular.        And other competitors might have been hurt, but -- but the whole purpose of it was to get your client.           That is to say, your client was in some special way a target.              Wasn't that part of your complaint?         Are you abandoning it?         I mean, if -- if you're abandoning it --         -- with -- with all --         -- you know, all the competitors are going to be covered.                   But if you're not abandoning it, then -- then -- you know, then maybe we can talk further.        Right.        Or, in -- in other words, your -- your targeted argument doesn't really make sense unless there is a family vendetta.                I mean, I -- I want to make money.           I don't care --        -- which of my competitors I'm -- I'm hurting unless I have some special reason to get one -- to get one -- one.               Now, I thought that was your case.          But maybe it's not.          Okay.      That is the only basis on which they're targeted.                   So if there had been 18 competitors in -- in the Bronx and Queens, then there would have been 18 targets.                   Right?          Okay.      Then we're back in the soup.       Gee, I -- I find that extraordinary that -- I claim to have been defrauded by somebody.         He makes a representation to me about the value of stock.             I don't believe it.            I really think it's ridiculous.             Of course, the stock is not worth that.       Okay?        I buy it anyway, and I can sue even though I didn't believe him?           Well, I -- I'm just talking about what the understood requirements of a fraud action were at common law.                 Mail fraud, any kind of fraud.       Surely there has to be some reliance upon the fraud.         Why -- why do you say mail fraud does -- does not have with it the normal common law fraud requirement of reliance?
04-473 +++$+++         Well, it --           And I think all the cases did say "expressing views as a citizen on a matter of public concern."         Wasn't that qualifier always used?           So, what does it mean?      What is -- what is your explanation for that qualifier, "expressing views as a citizen"?                   Why do we --           -- continually say that?        We just shouldn't have said "as a citizen" in all of these cases.                We were just padding our opinion with unnecessary words.           Is any -- is any duty of an employee in a -- an agency devoted to service of the public -- is any of his functions not a matter of public concern?          It's news.         This is a press -- a press kind of a test.          Newsworthy.        So --        -- so if an employee -- I really don't understand it -- an employee comes forward with some scurrilous information about a family member of his boss, who is a public figure, and his whole families are public figures, which would be picked up by the press, that would be a matter of public concern?        Gee, I never understood that that's what the test was.             I thought this was a matter that deals with the welfare of the public, rather than -- rather than the welfare of the press.        Well, that I understand.        That's the welfare of the public.        No, he's --          -- he's just saying, you know, his boss's wife, a mayor of a big city, is running around with somebody.            Okay?   And that's picked up by the press. It's there on the gossip pages.                   She's a public figure. You say that would be covered by this.          Anything that would get in the press.       That's it.          Wow.        -- plainly false.            Your answer to Justice Breyer's -- I was just going to jump in there -- your answer to Justice Breyer's question is, look at -- if you want to be sure that, in every case, you know, the good cases fall on this side, the bad cases fall on -- he should buy your position that every case should go to a balancing test. That will give you the perfection of first-amendment application.              The absolute perfection.           Now, it'll cost a lot of money, and it'll, you know, interfere with a lot of employment things, but it will give you first-amendment perfection.          Right?   I mean, that's the answer.        That's court of appeals.      You really don't know how many district-court judgments there may have been that didn't go up to the court.        I -- I'm --        I'm not sure you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question.              Her question was, Don't whistleblower statutes cover this?                 And your answer, if I understood it correctly, is, whistleblower statutes cover this, and a lot more.           That doesn't prove --        -- that doesn't prove--        -- that they don't take care of this problem.        Some would not cover it.
04-52 +++$+++            There -- there s no doubt that the court -- or at least in my mind, that -- that the trial court could have come out the other way.                    I -- I -- you know, all of the things you say are quite true.       The question is whether the trial court had to come out the other way, whether it was just utterly unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it did.      And that -- you know, that s a -- that s a heavy burden.        And -- and it is a messy transcript and all of that, but I -- I find it difficult to see how -- how you can establish that -- not only that -- that the trial court could have come out the other way or, indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment, should have come out the other way.                     But you have to establish that it s unreasonable not to come out the other way.          And -- and I find it hard to -- to see how you can do that when you have a transcript that relies, in part, upon the -- you know, the rolling of the eyes and the -- and the trial court says, I m -- I m willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that that s the reason she did it.           This prosecutor presumably appears before this judge on other occasions, and -- and don t you think we -- we can give some weight to the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees what she s saying, and -- and can judge better than we can whether she s making this up or just -- just is -- is somewhat confused, especially since, as -- as I think the General pointed out, we re dealing with a kind of determination that is usually instinctive on the part of trial counsel.                 There s just something about this, you know, and you move to strike.                        I m not sure it springs into your mind, at the time you -- you move to strike, the precise reason.                        Then somebody asks you later, why was it?               Why was it?           There was just something about that person I didn t like.                        I know it wasn t the race.            That had nothing to do with it.              Now, what was it?             And then -- then you have to recreate a -- a rational process that, in fact, never occurred. It was an instinctive process more than a rational one. So I m -- I m not particularly upset by -- by seeing counsel flounder about in -- in trying to come up with what the right reason was.                     I think it s probably pretty hard to figure out.            I m saying that it s hard. That s all.              And -- and that you can understand why somebody would flop around because, at the time the strike is made, I m -- I m not sure it s always an entirely rational rather than instinctive action.       Do you think that (d)(2) or (e)(1) is the -- is the stricter requirement?                 I m really not sure which of the two.                Don t you think it -- it might be possible to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the State court decision was -- factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do not show that it was unreasonable?                 In other words, it may well be that (d)(2) is -- is the more severe one.
04-593 +++$+++        Excuse me.       Brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari.            You -- you did not raise this.        So -- it's -- it's brand new to us.       We -- we didn't think this was in the case at all.           Excuse me.        I -- I thought the question presented -- I didn't think.                     I'm reading it from the petition for writ of certiorari.                     In the absence of a contractual relationship with the defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone sufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1981?                   So, I mean, the question presented was -- was precisely if your client did not have a contractual relationship, would the mere allegation of personal injury, which you're now alleging, be enough to confer standing?          Well, the question is -- I mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a violation of section 1981, and the argument here is that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.       Which you didn't allege and didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.       His contract with -- with the corporation?       No.       That's exactly the issue. And --       -- and that's how I understood this came -- case came up here.                The contract you're relying on is the contract between the corporation -- between the corporation and Domino's. And can you -- can you sustain a lawsuit for the violation of that contract?               There was no mention of any other contract.         I don't know why we should send it back down so you can mention a contract that you haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief in opposition. So that's the issue, whether the violation of the contract between MCDonald -- between Domino's and your client's corporation will allow your client to get -- to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target. That's how I understood the lawsuit.       Now, could you tell me when -- the -- the claim was settled when your client's corporation was in bankruptcy.               Right?       And I assume your client had no -- nothing to say about -- about whether the settlement would be -- would be accepted by the trustee or not.       It was out of his hands, which means that, you know, you're -- you're sort of pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which was that you left it to the corporation to settle this claim. And now you want to disclaim the advantage of a corporation and say, oh, although the -- you know, the corporation settled it out -- you know, I was no longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy -- I want to bring the claim on my own.                      I mean, I can understand why it would be nice for you to get that, but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to play dog in the manger that way.                     You either -- you either accept the corporate form or you don't.            Well, it was his -- it was his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery by -- by John MCDonald.                What -- what created your problem is the fact that -- that the corporation went bankrupt.            But, you know, that's -- that's one of the -- one of the consequences of taking advantage of the corporate form.       But it doesn't -- it doesn't talk about personal injury that -- that broadly.                It talks about the right to make and enforce contracts. That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon. It doesn't talk about --       -- personal injury.      It's not a --       -- it's not a more generalized tort.         If want to call it a tort, it is a tort that goes to your ability to make and enforce contracts.          I don't see anything --        -- dignitary about that.        And you're saying it means discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing of a contract with somebody else.                 And you're saying that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even though the contract was with -- was with somebody else, you have a claim under this language of 1981.       But -- but when you say damages that can be proven, the only damages you -- you insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target and that it -- it insulted you.               It -- it was -- you know.       That's the only damage you require.          So you're saying that every -- every minority employee of all of the companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do business, would automatically have a cause of action.            No.     Okay.     Well, then -- then what do they have to show?                    They have to show that -- that their salaries were -- were reduced?                      But -- but you haven't shown that here.                     You didn't plead that here.       They have to show -- show that a contract with them was breached?             But you didn't plead that here and you didn't show it here.                 So the -- the only thing that -- that you -- you can answer is they would all have causes of action if their -- their honorific values were somehow impugned.            That was -- that was the consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation.                        I mean, that didn't -- didn't --
04-597 +++$+++         Or as much of the record as the other side wanted to produce.         I'm not even sure your argument is so strong on the text, frankly.                  I don't know why 50(b) says -- it sets forth what can be done when the renewed motion is made.           You can, if a verdict was returned, allow it to stand, order a new trial, direct entry of judgment. If no verdict was returned, order a new trial, direct -- Why does the rule only say, "In ruling on a renewed motion, the Court may"?         Why wouldn't it say, "In ruling on a renewed motion or in acting upon the motion previously reserved," comma, "the Court may"?         I mean, where --         -- and where does it get the power to do these things, in ruling on a motion previously reserved, if it's not set forth there?        No, I'm talking about the only remedy available after the motion has been reserved, after --        -- the court has declined to rule on it once.        And that's all.        Can it order a new trial?        Where does he get that power, under (a)?        Unless --          Oh, well, then it shouldn't have been set forth in (b).                You didn't have to say it. You could have just said, you know, "Allow" --         Can a judge grant a new trial on a 50(a) motion?
04-607 +++$+++            You're too hungry, Mr. Estrada.        What was made by man here? What was made by man here?          I mean, if you're talking about the type of assay that your client developed, which was involved in other claims, not in 13, then I'd say, yes, that was made by man.               But here, what 13 involves is simply discovery of the natural principle that when one, when there is the presence of one substance in a human being, there is a deficiency of two other ones.                 That's just a natural principle.         What's made by man about that?       A way found elsewhere if indeed the Federal Circuit had determined the second step, you know, step 1, do the assay, step 2, correlate.                If the Federal Circuit had said, oh, that requires your using a scale to see how much of one there is and how little of the other, but this Federal Circuit says, all correlate means is be aware of the fact that when one substance is high, the other two are going to be low.             That's all it means.       No, please don't get off it -- because this is my biggest problem with the case.             I agree that what you've said is simply a statement of the natural phenomenon, that when the one substance is high, the other two are low.         And simply to be aware of that natural phenomenon is all that correlation consists of.        You mean life isn't a fountain? (Laughter.)
04-623 +++$+++             Maybe elevate your -- the microphone.            You're too tall. [Laughter.]         No, it didn't "stop it" --         -- but could the State allow it?         And if the State allowed it, the Federal Government would have to allow the drugs to be used for that purpose --       -- you're saying.       I would have thought that at the time this legislation was enacted, it would have been as unthinkable for a State to allow drugs to be used -- to be prescribed by a doctor to kill a patient as it would be for drugs to be subscribed by a doctor to make the patient feel better.       I mean, I think that assisted suicide would have been as unthinkable at the time this was enacted as prescribing cocaine just for recreational use.       Which comes down to an argument that "accepted medical practice" means accepted medical practice State by State --       -- rather than on some uniform basis.        Do you have any other area, regarding the enforcement of this Act, where the drug is allowed, or not allowed, to be used on the basis of divergent views of medical practice by divergent States?       Such as?       In palliative care?   And you think in some States you can -- you can prescribe these drugs without violating the Act; whereas, in other States, the same prescription would violate the Act.       Would it violate the Federal law in those other States?       Oh.    So you say that in -- with respect to many aspects of this legislation, what's lawful -- and what's lawful depends upon the accepted medical practice within the State.       Does this have to be reflected in the State medical board determinations, or just in what the -- what the doctors in that region tend to think is a good idea?       Any cases that you can think of where the same prescription has been held okay in one State and not okay in another State?            The --            Mr. Atkinson, you've spent most of your time talking about the statute and the regulations.              Do you also make the argument that ,even if the Government wanted to do this thing, it would be unconstitutional?       But why would it raise a significant constitutional question?                   I take it that it's none of the Government's business whether people gamble or not.      I take it, it's none of the -- the Federal Government -- I take it, it's none of the Federal Government's business whether people are allowed to drink at 21 or at 18, innumerable other things, which really are matters that belong to the police power of the States. But the Federal Government has chosen to regulate those things through the use of its commerce power.                   Is the drinking age any more a matter of -- or any less a matter of State privilege than suicide?       So, are those -- are those entries of the Federal Government into the regulation of drinking age, are they unconstitutional --       -- or do they raise serious constitutional questions?       Well, why does this one?      I don't --       Well, if ten States adopted assisted suicide, it might be a different -- a different --       -- constitutional --       -- question.        I would --        It seems to me -- it seems to me that you -- that you cannot accept the premise that it guts the Act, if you come in here with the proposition, which you do, that what the Act says is: whatever is accepted medical practice within the State is okay. That's your principal point.        But the Act does not refer to any overall Federal accepted medical practice.              It refers to accepted medical practice, State by State.              And, therefore, it in no way guts the Act if a State wants to let these drugs be used for, you know, make-people-happy purposes.          I don't see how you can accept the premise.            These are all different manners of assisting people to stay alive or assisting people to feel better.              Assisting people to die is something of a totally different category.            I don't deny that.     I -- I'm not taking a position on whether, you know, a State wants to allow it, or not.              I'm just taking a position on whether it was envisioned by Congress, in 1971, that accepted medical practice would include prescribing drugs to help somebody end his life.                    And I don't think it -- I don't think it would have occurred to Congress.
04-631 +++$+++        What if -- what -- perhaps the State expresses it that way just to cover some people who get their gas illegally, and they would say the tax is still due, even if you haven't gotten your gas from a distributor who has paid the State tax.                    Wouldn't that suffice for why the court imposes the tax on the use, sale, or delivery?         Use, sale, or delivery.       Who is -- who is the tribe taxing?        Is the tribe taxing the purchaser of the gas?             Is that --       Is that --       I thought the retailer was the tribe.       So, it's taxing itself.       That's real neat.      I have never heard of that before. [Laughter.]       Cities and counties --       -- aren't sovereign.            All the other sovereigns you mentioned do not consume the gas -- or the gas sold to them is not consumed primarily on the roads of this State, except for cities and counties, which aren't sovereigns. I mean, they simply aren't sovereign.                       That's the State, itself.        They're subdivisions of the State.                 So, it's making exemptions for its own -- its own State, plus exemptions for sovereigns, where the gas sold to those sovereigns probably will not be used primarily on the roads of this State.            It makes perfect sense.         I don't see there's any discrimination.         Yeah, but that's because when a distributor sells to another distributor, he is not acting, for purposes of that sale, as a distributor.         If you sell to another distributor, you're not being --
04-698 +++$+++         Mr. Garre, you -- or, Mr. Garre, you said, in your earlier statement, that sometimes the school district will be the complaining party.                   How does that -- how does that come up?         Now, why would the school district have to take any action?                  Why wouldn't it just --         -- just say, "The child can't come to class.            He's too disruptive," period?         Right.         Okay.            These cases are appealed to Federal courts normally, aren't they?            In Federal courts.    And most of these cases are in Federal courts.                     And you're -- you want to condemn Federal courts to figuring out what the State burden of proof is?        Well, would you --        Well, you have a statute that -- you know, it's in -- it's in great detail -- on administrative procedures.              It obviously -- you know, decision of hearing officer, administrative procedures, disclosure, evaluations, and recommendations.                 And you think the Federal Government goes into all this detail and doesn't care who has the burden of proof?                That seems, to me, most unlikely.        Well, there's no violation here.      I mean, this is a totally different --        -- situation.        I mean --        But you say this is --         -- okay.       You say all these horrible consequences are perfectly okay, so long as the States do it.        I mean, if the consequences are that horrible, how can you allow the States to put the burden on the other side?        Well, I understand that.        But your -- your parade of horribles just never --        -- never gets started, once you -- once you acknowledge that the States can blow the whistle to start the parade.            Absent different disposition by the States?             What's the Government's position?             Can the States change this burden, just the background, you know -- unless you -- unless you think it's okay to, you know --           -- have the heavens fall -- we don't want the heavens to fall.        This --        These other cases that you refer to, where -- that involve spending legislation, where the States go beyond what is minimally required -- I suspect that they are cases where it really is an imposition on the States, and they accept it.             Here, the imposition is not on the States, it's on the local school districts.          And very often, the interests of the local school district is quite different from the interests of the people, you know, down-State, in the State capital. I'm -- I am loath to think that just because a State supreme court says that every school district in the State has to bear the burden of proof, that Congress intended that to be the case.          I think it's a different -- a different situation, where the spending is money that's coming out of the -- ultimately, out of the pocket of the school district.

It seems to me anybody you sue is a real party.       Well, if they said they were, then it seems to me -- why don't you just hold them to it?       I mean, it seems very odd that they -- they say, "We were," and you say, "Oh, no, you weren't." [Laughter.]          "We shouldn't have sued you."       Why don't you just take them at their word and sue them?        Well, what if they did? Suppose they did say, "Not me," and you proceeded with your lawsuit.        Okay?      What would happen?        They would win the judgment.          Would they be the real party in that controversy?       Of course they would be. Because you sued them.

04-721 +++$+++         Wait.      A case that was a procedural-bar case?        Well, you --       -- you could summarily deny and cite a case that showed you were denying on the merits.       Where they cited a procedural-bar case.           Why is that the most reasonable presumption?               Why isn't the most reasonable presumption that the California Court denies, for untimeliness, wherever that issue is absolutely clear - -          -- and where that issue is not absolutely clear, and the -- and the merits issue is absolutely clear, it just -- it just denies?          It doesn't want to say "denied on the merits," because that would suggest that it was timely.       I don't know what it -- "most" is 51 percent.          I mean, among those that you don't know whether it was the merits or not, there could be a lot of ones where the timeliness is simply not decided upon.            Well --            -- the burden --            -- for that one is on him. I mean, if you say the burden is on the State to come up with a -- you know, showing that there was such a system, they came up with it.              And you say, "The system may have been amended."           Well, if it has been amended, there the burden is on you.       I mean --       -- well --          There isn't.       You --          You mean if you go in and you say, "I'm" -- you know, it's more than 90 days, and you bring in no evidence whatever of any excuse for being over 90 days, you're telling me that California Supreme Court would accept it?          Well, then --          -- then it is a presumption --       -- that if it's over 90 days, unless you have a reason, it's untimely.       There's one aspect of Saffold that you haven't addressed.                    We not only said what we said about they're saying "on the merits," we actually cited a case that involved exactly the situation here -- namely, Welch versus Newland, a CA9 case from 2001.           And we cited that as an example of how the Ninth Circuit rule, quote, "risks the tolling of the Federal limitations period even when it is highly likely that the prisoner failed to seek timely review in the State appellate courts," close quote.          How could the Ninth Circuit here simply have ignored that criticism of exactly what they did here?          But we --          -- we didn't cite the en banc decision.            We cited the panel decision --          -- didn't we?       After.       But the point is, we criticized the panel decision in Welch, which did exactly what this panel did here.       We cited --       -- it for the proposition that it -- as an example of how the Ninth Circuit rule, quote, "risks the tolling of the Federal limitations period even when it is highly likely that the prisoner failed to seek timely review in the State appellate courts."         That's what we cited.
04-759 +++$+++         Well, that goes to the remand question raised --        -- earlier.        It doesn't -- it doesn't go to whether the Ninth Circuit was correct here.        Mr. Cotter, I don't -- I don't see, in the opinion, any indication that the Ninth Circuit was doing what you -- what you assert it was trying to do -- namely, to predict what future California law -- locked deep in the bosom of the California Supreme Court, but not yet disclosed to the public -- will hold.               It didn't proceed that way at all.         It says, generally, the United States can be held liable only when liability was attached to a private actor.        However, the United States may be liable, quoting from one of the Ninth Circuit's earlier cases, for the performance of some activities that private persons do not perform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred.               I don't see they are saying, "We are trying to predict what California would do in a private situation."         They have set forth a rule that, where there's no cause of action against a private person, we look to whether there would be a cause of action under -- against a State or subdivision of the State.        How long ago was that -- was Louie decided?        Twenty years ago.       And Washington still has not yet made this prediction come true, I gather.        Exactly.        It has not extended its Government Tort Claims Act to private citizens.        No, I'm saying the prediction that Louie made had not yet come true.                   There is still no Washington decision that has done what Louie said it would --        -- would be done.      But it didn't try to do that. It made no effort to do that.           It just said -- it just said the United States may be liable when a State or municipal entity would be held liable.                  It made no effort to figure out what Washington would do with a private individual.        What --        What was your response to the motion to dismiss?          The Government said that you didn't raise, in response to the motion to dismiss, any assertion that private individuals would be liable --        -- under State law in this -- in this situation.        Oh, I -- that's how I understood it.        Okay.        What was your response?        You said that?        You said that, "And we have a -- we have asserted all the elements of Good Samaritan"?        Okay.
04-805 +++$+++             I don't -- I don't really -- who -- who would set the price if it was not -- if it was not the joint venture?            The joint venture owns the gasoline.         Okay?     And it owns the gas stations, those that aren't independent stations.                     And somebody else is going to set the price for the gas that the joint venture owns?            Wouldn't you need some separate agreement that clearly sets that forth?            It's the board of directors. Isn't it?            Isn't the members committee the board of directors of -- of the joint venture?            That's because it's a joint venture.            That's the nature of a joint venture.         The board of directors is composed of people representing the various elements of the joint venture.            There's nothing subversive about that.        Yes, but that's because the joint venture did not include -- did not include a merging of the product as it did here.                    Here, the gasoline from both of them was merged into one gasoline, which was sold and the profit of which was divided between them.           In -- in Citizens Publishing, each of the newspapers continued to sell its own newspaper and to -- and to reap whatever profit it could make from its own newspaper.                    That's fundamentally different from here.                    There -- there still is competition between the two newspapers.           But they were competitors. They were -- each one of them sold its own newspaper. All they merged was -- was their publishing facilities. And when they agreed separately not to -- to charge the same price for the newspaper, that was not part of the joint venture.            That was, indeed, an agreement between competitors.             There were two separate newspapers selling on the basis of their own distribution system and so forth.           Of course --           -- they're not able to fix the price unless they have market dominance.                      I mean, do you think they're just competing with each other? Aren't there other companies selling gasoline?           And I don't think that this -- this joint venture would have been allowed if -- if these two companies together dominated the market.                        Of course, it wouldn't have been allowed.           You mean fix prices successfully.           Fix -- fix prices and not be an idiot at the same time. (Laughter.)        You don't -- you don't want them to present it to a jury, as I understand it.        You don't want them to present it to a jury.           The whole reason that you're here is that you want us to declare a per se violation. You -- you want to put it to a jury?        Mr. Alioto --        Who -- who is it that you would have had the price set by?        I mean, it's their gas. Okay?       They're marketing it through their stations. Who -- who would have set the price if -- if we said it's -- it's bad for Equilon to do it?        Gave whom independence? Gave whom --        They did give them independence.        That is --        They gave their board of directors independence.                Now, the board of directors was composed, as -- as boards of directors of joint ventures are, by the parties to the joint ventures.            Who -- have you answered my question?         Who would you have wanted to set the price in this case?            But I think they did say the former.        You -- you make the price decisions.                  Equilon.            Your -- your complaint is that Equilon is in reality a joint venture of -- of the two -- the two gasoline companies.        That's your complaint.

Well, and letters are carried in a mail truck, but we allow a cause of action for negligence of the driver of the mail truck.                 That's unique to mail, too.            You're leaving something --            That was the very point, leaving something on the porch where somebody can trip on it isn't unique to mail --            -- just as driving a truck isn't.        Except that you -- my biggest hangup -- and I wish you'd go through your distinguishing of it again -- is the -- is the Kosak case.                 Carrying the mail in a mail truck is the handling of the mail.                  There is no doubt that it's the handling of the mail.                 And it seems to me it doesn't -- it isn't enough to say, "Well, other people drive trucks, too."                Well, that's true.     But other people deliver packages, too, and leave 'em on the doorstep.          How do you distinguish Kosak?       Excuse me.       You're -- I assume the Government has conceded Kosak, the dictum in Kosak.       Now, do you concede that point, or not?       If you concede the point, it doesn't matter whether it's dictum.       So, you --       -- you are trying to draw a distinction between driving the mail in the truck and leaving the mail on the doorstep.                What's the basis for that distinction?        Yes, but I don't --        -- I don't understand your last distinction.              You say there is no liability for the package that falls off the back of the truck, but there is liability if the truck hits another vehicle.                   I really don't understand the basis for that distinction.             Right.            Which happens all the time in other trucks, not just mail trucks.            But you can say the same thing about the driving of the truck that contains the mail.       Same thing with the --       -- same thing with the person who veers to avoid the package that falls off the back of the mail truck.       She says that.

04-885 +++$+++       Well, you're saying that much of the language of (b) is ineffective and superfluous?                   (b) certainly tries to limit it.               It says "has waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction."             You're just saying all of that is ineffective, then?           In what context would it be effective?      And, again, I still don't see how you distinguish (b) when you say "(b) doesn't apply here, it may apply in other cases."           If it doesn't apply here, why would it apply in other cases?         I mean, if you are appealing to this broader principle, that you either waive all of sovereign immunity or you waive none of it at all, and you can't just restrict it to the particular claim, which is what (b) says, I don't know why, in any case, that wouldn't be true.       Happy Halloween. [Laughter.]       Well, you were, but you're not.       I mean, you're --       -- trying to get rid of that, right?         Would you explain to me again why it's okay that your waiver argument below was only directed to the claims against VMI?         I'm not -- I didn't understand your answer to that.           You made a much narrower argument there than you're making here.         You didn't -- you didn't assert that all the sovereign immunity for the entire State and all of its institutions had been waived simply because of the claim by VMI.     You didn't make that argument.         Yes.         What -- which said what?        Well, then why didn't you make the argument?        I mean, if Hood said, when you make a partial -- or one institution -- if I understand what you're saying, Hood said that a waiver by one institution waives for the whole State.                     Is that -- is that what Hood said?        Yes.        But if you're making a separate waiver argument, apart from the abrogation argument, I don't see why you would not make that waiver argument as broadly as possible.        It's a separate argument from the abrogation argument.        And you're making it as a separate argument here.            But here, you're making it as to all claims against all State institutions; whereas, below you made it only as to the claims against VMI.               I don't understand that.          I see.          I see.

I mean, we -- we can call in these witnesses ourselves, I suppose, and hear them all again, but we usually accept the factual findings of the trier of fact.        Ms. Smith, could -- could you go on to some of the other elements that are contested here?        In particular, I'm interested in -- in Mr. Muncey's confession.            What -- what do you -- what do you say about that?        Justice Breyer has not heard these witnesses and hasn't had the opportunity to know whether -- whether, for example, these -- this testimony about the confession was credible or not.        And the hearer of -- at the trial did have that opportunity.        There is evidence of rape besides -- besides the semen.               The semen wasn't the only evidence of rape, was it?        There were scratches on the thighs.
04-905 +++$+++            What evidence was there of competition here?             How -- did you bring forward instances where they both bid for sale of special trucks to a single repurchaser?       Yes, but it's very hard to compare those two sales, because they all depend upon the special features on the trucks that are ordered by the particular individual, and also how -- you know, how much of a hard bargain that individual is driving.           I don't know how you can compare a sale to one -- one person with XYZ features on the truck with a sale to a totally different person with ABC features on the truck.       For resale --       -- to a different purchaser, who may have been in a better position with regard to the negotiation than any of your customers were.       Why is it --       -- why is it --       -- why is it unreasonable -- why does it violate the principle of Robinson-Patman, and why does it destroy competition, for Volvo to say, "We'll make whatever discount it takes to get the sale, and if this dealer needs a 20 percent discount for this sale, but this other fellow over here only needs a 10 percent discount to make that sale, we're going to have a differential discount"?            Why -- I don't see why that harms competition.       That -- that's a --       -- that's a -- that's a broad Robinson-Patman principle you're arguing for, that a -- that a seller such as Volvo has to make sure that each of its distributors makes the same profit?       And if --       -- if it works its system in such a way that one of them is making less profit than another, it's liable?       Do you have any instance where you made an offer to a buyer assuming that you'd get the kind of a break that Volvo gives to other dealers -- all right? -- you made that offer, and the buyer says, "Yes, I'll take it at that price" -- and then you go to Volvo, and they won't give you that?       Where you made the offer to the buyer --         -- and the buyer had agreed to buy it --         -- and you --        You should have written a better contract.         But on a misinterpretation of Robinson-Patman. [Laughter.]       Mr. Phillips, how many States have these fair franchising laws?           Are there any States that don't?
04-928 +++$+++           So, if we vacate it and the case is remanded on that ground, I assume it's still open for you to point out to the Oregon Supreme Court that they were in error about the -- about the status of the testimony that you tried to get in, and have it admitted on that ground.               Why isn't that the way to handle the matter, rather than your --          -- as you express it, "mooting the case"?          Of course, that -- there would still remain -- whether you mooted the case, or whether we vacated and then it was left to the Oregon Supreme Court whether to let this evidence in -- there would still remain the question of what kind of an instruction the jury can be given regarding the consideration of this evidence for purposes not of determining whether a guilty person should not be given the death penalty, but, rather, for purpose of considering whether the guilt is clear enough.               I mean, that's -- that issue would still remain, wouldn't it?          Why wouldn't it?          No, I understand, but what are you -- what are you going to argue to that jury? Are you going to argue to that jury, you know, that, "Yes, my client has been convicted, but the evidence of his guilt was really not all that clear, and you should take that into" -- don't you want to make that argument?          And the Oregon Supreme Court says you can make that argument, because the eighth amendment requires you to be able to make that argument.          And what the State says is, "No, the eighth amendment requires no such thing."                    So, the issue hasn't gone away.                It's still here.    It's here in this very case.          What the --          No, no, no.       You're entitled to get the evidence in, under Oregon law, but the question of how that evidence can properly be used by the jury has been decided by the Oregon Supreme Court only on the basis of the eighth amendment, not on the basis of any Oregon statute.          In the penalty phase.          In the penalty phase?          Hasn't that already been found in the guilt phase?          You --          You can be found guilty of murder when you didn't intend to kill?            That seems to be very strange, because I think our cases require -- require that for death eligibility, and --           I would pass, if I were you. [Laughter.]          They used to have --          -- two trials.         I mean, you know, that's the whole problem here.                      Your client has been tried as to whether he committed the offense, and found guilty, and now you --          -- now you want to relitigate the same matter.                I don't --          I don't --          And on the basis that the Constitution requires you to be able to relitigate the same matter two times in the same criminal proceeding, that doesn't seem, to me, right.          I thought -- well, I guess it     -- I guess it depends on what you mean by an "alibi."         If all you mean by an "alibi" is that, for part of the offense, he was somewhere -- I thought an alibi meant, "I am not guilty, because I was not there."        That's what I thought an alibi was --
04-944 +++$+++             Mr. Prendergast --        -- my problem with -- with your -- your contention is that I don't know how it is that you -- that you intuit that this one definition is jurisdictional.        I mean, the definition -- the -- the 15 employee limit is -- is part of the definition of employer in section 701.        There are 13 other definitions in section 1701.              For example, it defines on the basis of sex.          Now, if -- if you contest whether a particular remark or a particular practice of the employer was -- fell within that definition, was on the basis of sex or not, would you say that the court had no jurisdiction?        Will you challenge -- well, why are you challenging jurisdiction when you're -- when you're saying the -- the definition of -- of employer has not been met, but you are not challenging jurisdiction when you say the definition of on the basis of sex has not been met.               Why -- why pick on one rather than the other?        Yes, I -- I understand that.        That -- that's what it comes down to.        But how do you know --        If both definitions in section 701 --        -- why does one of them express one thing and another not express --           In other words, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference.           I'm not sure that helps your case. (Laughter.)
04-9728 +++$+++        Is --       Is --       Is that right?        I mean, even in prison, I -- what -- I'm not sure you could even do that if they were still in prison.                 Can you subject people in prison --       No.     No, I --       The Chief Justice was trying to get out of the Fourth Amendment into the Fifth.       Most --       Most States --       -- don't let felons vote.        I mean, that's a punishment that they impose after they're out of prison.       It seems to me that the principal difference, Mr. Niver, is that when he's on parole, it's in lieu of being in jail.                  If that's not the difference, you don't persuade me.                  He has voluntarily accepted the parole in exchange for his getting out of jail.          And he'd be in worse condition if he were in jail.         That's what, seems to me, makes the difference.       I thought you said that maybe cavity searches would not -- would not be allowed without some special reason for them.                  And that wouldn't necessarily be harassment.       Yes --       I mean --       Okay.       Well, suppose you couldn't - -       -- you couldn't --       -- conduct cavity searches without some special reason, even in prison.                 Wouldn't that be -- isn't there some remnant of a fourth- amendment right in prison that you cannot subject, you know, the whole cellblock to cavity searches?       Do we --            I think he said he was unaware of anybody who was dragged out kicking and screaming.       No.       He's asking you, I think, Justice Alito's question, "Do we have to get into that?"       So long as this one's okay, why do -- why do we have to get into whether there might be some other ones that aren't okay?
04-980 +++$+++           Ms. Rivkind, I really don't understand what harm is done here.                   I can understand you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says, "The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances," which are -- have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute -- "shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be true against the mitigating," and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional. Okay?       Then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad. I don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is "heinous, atrocious, or cruel," and that is later found invalid by the State supreme court.                    But then, in the weighing process, the jury is told, "Don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime." Now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors, "heinous, atrocious, and cruel," would also have found that "heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty" to be one of the circumstances to be weighed.                    So, what harm is done?       I hope so. [Laughter.]        Assuming --         -- assuming the district court does the -- the district court in the Ninth Circuit does the harmless-error analysis correctly.         I've never heard that described as a mitigating factor before.                I mean, it's certainly worse if you're a triggerman, but I don't know what makes it -- somehow it's mitigating if you were not the triggerman.           I would say that you're not guilty of something even worse.            But to call that a factor of mitigation --            He wants to know whether you would like to be thrown --            -- I think the answer is yes. [Laughter.]            It's the same jury.       It's the same jury.          The same jury that found it atrocious and cruel in the guilt phase would find it atrocious and cruel in the weighing stage.               I don't see --       But what -- the specificity you need for the narrowing factor does not exist with respect to mitigating factors.          We've said anything can be a mitigating factor.         I find it impossible to believe that the California Supreme Court said not only is the phrase "heinous, atrocious, and cruel" too -- you know, too vague for the narrowing factor, but, when you get to the weighing phase, the fact that the murderer sliced up his victim with a thousand cuts of the knife cannot be taken into account by the jury.            That's unbelievable.         But the statute does not say "the finding of any special circumstances found to be true."        It says "the existence of any special circumstances found to be true."                 That's what they're -- that's what they're instructed to consider.                 The existence.          In determining the penalty, the trier of fact take into account the following, (a), it says, the "existence" of any special circumstances found to be true; not the "fact" that they were found to be true.
05-1056 +++$+++               That, that code is not patentable, you've said.              I hope we can continue calling it the golden disk.             It has a certain Scheherazade quality that really adds a lot of interest to this case. (Laughter.)
05-1074 +++$+++                Mr. Nager, why did it make any sense to treat this area any different from the Equal Pay Act.            Mr. Gornstein, why should we listen to the Solicitor General rather than the EEOC?   I mean, they have taken a different position from the one that you're urging upon us.             Touche.
05-1120 +++$+++                I think it can be argued that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that here.               He has said that 6 percent is enough.              Can I ask about that?           I found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain.                       Is there anything wrong with that response?                    It seems to me --             You concede that it's an air pollutant that affects health?             Then why isn't it air pollution within the meaning of the statute, although whatever it is that causes acid rain is?             But you can't give me any text in this statute itself.            It isn't the phrase "air pollution" or any other phrase?             And that gets us back to acid rain.             So that's the position you're taking, that it is within the general term?              I presume the problem that they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in international negotiations.            If we have done everything we can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make with foreign nations?      What incentive do they have to go along with us?
05-1126 +++$+++            Well, i mean, you know, that's shame on them.       But we're trying to get this case right and, you know, I don't care what position they took before.     I care about what the right answer is, and I find it difficult to believe that you can simply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile, period.    Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?            Perhaps?            The agreement happens at one moment in time.            Meetings of the minds, meeting of the minds.       I used to each Contracts. Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.            I think, by the way, that that argument applies not just to the keeping out the upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter your field I know that you're going to enter mine. It just doesn't pay for me to do it.                   Yeah, I can make money, but I'll lose money.              It seems to me perfectly natural for companies that have a certain geographic area in which they are the, the principal, the selected instrument and although they technically can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know that if they do it they will be subjected to the same thing.   That is nothing more than conscious parallelism.             After several years --           I used to work in the field of telecommunications and if the criterion is that happens which Congress expected to happen when it passed its law, your case is very weak.           Well, you need what is called the plus factor, and I gather that you acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this, this parallel action seemed to be against the self interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus factor and you would lose.            So all you have to do to prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your pleading, and there is a plus factor?            You have to say what it is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?           How much money do you think it would have cost the defendants by then to assemble all of the documents that you're going to be interested in looking at?           How many buildings will have to be rented to store those documents and how many years will be expended in, in gathering all the materials?
05-11284 +++$+++               I guess striking a big person is not quite as bad as striking a little person.
05-11304 +++$+++               Is there some reason, Mr. Schaerr, why that would be more egregious when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by a Federal district court than it is when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by the State supreme court?          Wouldn't it be just as bad when the State supreme court has said the Federal Constitution has been violated and then the case goes back to the lower State court and the lower State court applies some standard for plain error which is, which is simply different from what is, what is being urged here today.    I'm sure that happens all the time.             And I don't know why it's any worse, any worse when you do it to a Federal district court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says than when you do it to the State supreme court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says.              Well, we haven't had the issue before us, have we?            That's why you're here.            Well, that reason would apply equally, however, to determinations of Federal rights by State courts.            And I think everybody understands that State courts do this all the time, and indeed a good way to do an end run around what, what, what the other side in this case seems to want is simply for the State supreme court to find a violation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a Federal court and then have the State lower court apply whatever harmless error standard it wishes, which would be a crazy system.            So if you're going to adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted not only for references back to the State court from a Federal decision, but you would surely have to apply it to all State determinations of Federal law, and I don't really know what authority we would have to require lower State courts to do that.
05-1157 +++$+++                He's not saying that that's this case.    He's just saying that it's so easy to make allegations that action which was perfectly legitimate amounted to action that was illegitimate.                  And that question ultimately gets thrown into the laps of the jury; and if the jury comes out the wrong way, you get hit with treble damages.               I'm done.             Why is that?     I don't understand why the SEC could not -- they can make rules for a single IPO; it seems to me they can make rules for coordination of IPO.      Why can't they do that?             Right, right.             They have chosen not to.               No, but --               But you -- you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a stock when the -- in the case of a single offering.                     You could -- you could look upon that as, as an attempt to raise the price.   That's what it is, isn't it?                    An attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out there?              Yeah.       And you're saying they did this just -- not in the context of just single IPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would all do this.              Why?              Uh-huh.          The customer being the issuer?              They'd have to pay the premium.             Look, the question isn't whether it satisfies it.          The question is whether you can get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to go through enormously expensive discovery, which -- which isn't worth the candle.              -- discovery?      Right?             I don't think you've answered his question.             I think that you've said that the two were different.             His question was how can you tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the difference between those two things that you've mentioned?    Sure they're different but -- but the evidence that is only evidence of the one also looks like evidence of the other.              But that wasn't the SEC's position below, was it?             And the Justice Department was on one side, the SEC was on the other.               Right?             It looks to me like they split the baby up here. (Laughter.)               I don't understand what happens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of an antitrust suit.      You're entitled to a jury trial in the antitrust suit, right?               And in primary jurisdiction, would we refer it to the SEC and accept the SEC's fact determinations and then instruct the jury that --             And it is really the factual determination that is the hang-up, that you don't want things that are innocent and that the SEC would know are innocent to be taken as evidence of guilty by the jury.      So you really haven't accomplished a whole lot if you just send it over to the SEC for rulings on the law as opposed to rulings on whether this particular conduct violated the law.
05-1240 +++$+++              Who is the defendant in a Fifth Amendment claim?        Is it the policemen who extracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?             Right.
05-1256 +++$+++            You're losing me, counsel.   What, what specifically is wrong with the instruction proposed here?           As briefly as possible, one, two, three.              Would it have been a proper instruction if the second sentence had read, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the -- what that reasonable relationship is, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence -- what, what that reasonable relationship is?           If you had just added in that additional thought.              It seems to me that's all that's left out of it.      Now does leaving that out of it make it erroneous?              Yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship.           The more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, according to our cases as I understand it.           You're saying this instruction was too favorable to you --           -- because it allowed them to consider harm.           And you don't think they should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?          Counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed.    The Supreme Court of Oregon said it was properly disallowed because you can take into account directly the harm to other people, isn't that the case?          Okay.        Why not?            So your only objection is that they left out the reason why it is relevant to determining what the ratio should be?               They just didn't say you can consider it in connection with reprehensibility.   Why is that crucial?            But why was it critical?             Too favorable to you.        Too favorable to you again, right? (Laughter.)           But what if -- your friend says, what if we never get assessed for any other case? Where do we make up this money?           Suppose they win every other case in Oregon.
05-1272 +++$+++               Unfortunately, it was not the criminal conduct that was ultimately -- it was not the manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the basis on which the Government proceeded?                He knew about this bad pipe, right?      Or he said that this was a bad pipe system?   He didn't say anything as I understand it about their not adding enough cement which is the theory that went to the jury.               Yeah.       Let me -- let me look at what -- let me look at 175.                      This is, this what he says.   "After careful study, I concluded that the suggested process" -- this means of piping the sludge out -- "would result in an unstable mixture that would later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic wastes to the environment.           I also noted based on my analysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that the sludge and liquid present in the -- present in the evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and radioactive substances at Rocky Flats." I mean, that's all very good, but it has nothing to do with what this company was convicted of, which is not -- cutting down on the amount of cement it was adding.             During a certain period after this it was creating perfectly good blocks by adding more cement.      Then they got a new manager who said let's use less cement.             And that's when they started producing the defective blocks.                  It has nothing to do with his allegations.             And why did the government claim it was insolid?       What was the claim made for -- as to the reason for the insolidity?                Was -- here's an easy question.   Was this evidence that we read, his testimony from 175 of the joint appendix, was that introduced at the trial?               Was this evidence introduced from some other source?                   Was the jury told there was this piping that was taking out too much liquid with the sludge?          Was the jury told that?               So his central allegation was not even placed before the jury?              We've also said that jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case. Something like standing.         We say standing is examined throughout the trial.      There's an easier standard at the beginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a motion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and finally, if the facts of -- involving standing are tried, there's the highest standard at the end of the trial. I mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to be assured throughout.               Well, that's all very nice, but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not.               It laid down some textual conditions in the statute.           And unless they are complied with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person you think ought to get the money is really totally irrelevant.              Let's take this case.           Did the government use any of the evidence that Stone produced?   Did it introduce that affidavit which said the pipe wasn't working right?              Was that part of the evidence?              Well, what else had he provided beyond -- did you use anything that came from him?              But did you use at trial anything that he provided you?                Did you use anything he provided you in order to prove it?                No, neither am I.             How is it possible to say that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred after he had left Rockwell?             I mean, all of this failure occurred after he was gone.             Not only not because of this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, not only it was not because of that.                      But he was gone.               That's right.          And how would he know except from published report that these blocks were failing?               But prediction is not knowledge.     Prediction is not direct knowledge.                And his sufficient information you assert is his prediction that these blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be the reason for their failure.               That is what you say is his direct knowledge.              So you think relators can get part of the Government's recovery even where their initial allegations before the Government intervenes have nothing whatever to do with the reason the Government is ultimately giving money?                  You think they are still entitled to a piece of the pie?              So you don't believe that, then.   You think that indeed the reason the Government was given the money has to be connected with, with his allegations?   Right?              Try this hypothetical.   The relator says:   I know that they've been cheating the Government because I, I observed the president of the company going into a meeting with the chief engineer and another person, and at that meeting I suspect they were devising this scheme to defraud the Government. It turns out there was indeed a scheme to defraud the Government, but that meeting never occurred. It wasn't the president of the company who went into the meeting.   It was Charlie Chaplin.               And the facts are totally, totally wrong.        Does he get money?              Does he get money just because he came out with the same charge that the Government ultimately proves?             Simply because he said the company is guilty of cheating the Government, even though the facts on which he bases it are entirely wrong?              Well, assume one that just gets over the line.              It turns out to be entirely wrong.     Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only reason he believed this company was defrauding the Government was absolutely wrong.
05-128 +++$+++           You're begging the question by calling it a plan.             I mean, that -- that's -- that's one of the issues here.              Why don't you tell us what workmen compensation laws require?           What's your answer to the 180 days question I answered -- I asked?                      You know, the provision provides contributions.                      It doesn't say just contributions to an employee benefit plan.                     It says contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but -- but the services have to be within the last 180 days.        How do you square that with -- with the purchase of block insurance like this?        But each of those insurance premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover workers who've worked for the last 180 days.                    Each premium is divided among all the workers who've been working there for years.         Some of the premiums are going to go to -- to allow the insurance company to pay in the future people who have been there for 20 years.       I mean, it just seems to me it's a square peg in a round hole.                 I -- I don't see how you make sense out of that 180 --        You really think that -- that they cut it that fine?                They say, oh, yes, this guy is going to go into bankruptcy.                     We're pretty sure about that, but don't worry.                We'll have priority.       I think as soon as they smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug anyway.          It has to be arising from services rendered.           I mean, it -- it really has to be part of the contract with the employer --       Mr. Verrilli, what -- what is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that is, the -- the bank that gave letters of credit? They're just insuring -- that -- that's part of the plan too.         They couldn't have gotten the insurance from you unless they got the letters of -- of credit from the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance. And also in the case of self-insurance, which is something of a plan -- I -- I guess you'd call it a plan -- what about the -- the person who puts up the bond?       That person is a kind of insurer, just as you are.      Do all of these people now -- now get bumped up to the head of the line?            Where -- where does that appear?            Yes, because it's not in the briefs --            -- just -- just as the contract isn't before us.           How do we know what you've just told us?            Is that in the record?           You're just assuring us what the content of the insurance contract is.      Right?          But we don't have the insurance contract.            So we -- we have your assurance that that's what happens here.            Well, it has to be that way? I could write a contract differently.            That's a --         But it's not just to those. It's to a lot of other people.              I mean, that's --         Well, except the workers who had already been injured in the past --         -- and -- and whom you continue to pay.          Right?       Right.       And I assume that each of your premiums takes into account the fact that you're not only going to be paying for people, you know, who were injured between the last premium and now, but that you're also going to be paying for people who were injured a long time ago.
05-1284 +++$+++               They are called FTC ratings?              And they are called -- in the regulations it's called the FTC test, even after it has been done by the companies?              That's very careless, isn't it?              Have, have they imposed its official -- has it imposed, the FTC, its official results on any company that was not a participant in this -- in this testing lab?              Your case would be stronger if they weren't doing it just for themselves.            If in fact that they were doing it for the FTC who imposed it even on somebody else.                Yeah.                Because here you're doing it for yourself.     You want to advertise low -- low -- low tar cases.     And the FTC says the only way we'll let you do it, the only way we'll let do you that advertising is if you test them pursuant to this, this system that we established. And you say okay.               We'll test them pursuant to the system you've established and -- and everybody goes happily away.                 Well that's a good, that's a good preemption argument.                 I'm not sure it has much bearing upon whether --                 It all comes back to me now, that case you mentioned.               Lip drape, that was the lip drape case, wasn't it, where people smoke differently because some of them cover up the holes in the filter when their lips -- the lip drape.                The naked lip drape.
05-130 +++$+++        When you say going forward, I thought we were talking about damages for the past violation, not damages for future violations which will continue.         Are we talking about that too?       About the court effectively saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip away and continue violating it.       In this case, they -- they claim not to want to violate it in the future.               They're just talking about, you know, the -- the past actions should -- should be compensable by damages and not -- they should not be subjected to a very threatening injunction.            Which -- when they will be calculable.              You're saying it's hard to calculate them into the future.             You want the district court to calculate what the future damages will be and say, we think the damages will be this.                    Here, take your money, and you, God bless you, go continue to violate the patent.            Is that what --
05-1342 +++$+++                  I think, the question is not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic division of the statute into a national bank and affiliates of the national bank.                 The statute makes a clear distinction between the two.                   And the effect of what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't matter.                 If you are an affiliate of a national bank, you have the same immunity that the national bank has.      That's not what the statute says.             I mean, an operating subsidiary is an affiliate, right?                 What kind of affiliates did they have before they had operating subsidiaries?   Did they rent pool halls, or what?             I would have thought that any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged in essentially banking business.             What is a functionally regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.             And is that a functionally regulated subsidiary?              What comes next?            Can the OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to this subsidiary?   Can it do that?             What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries. And here is a regulation which under the guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the national bank simply eliminates that distinction.            And it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency regulation is allowed to do.
05-1345 +++$+++               So don't call it a user fee.   Call it something else.             Then you can charge whatever you want, so long as you don't call it a user fee, right?               You know, there's a general agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't apply when the government is engaged in a commercial activity.     Now, why shouldn't something similar apply to government regulation which ends up discriminating against out of State businesses, when the government is engaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the restrictions of the Commerce Clause?                      Why isn't that a reasonable rule?              You could do that by requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each householder just as much trouble then there could be competition and you would have achieved your goal.                  No?              You could do that by law. You could do that by law.          You could specify that only certain waste facilities can be used.              You don't have to run the business in order to assure that, do you?              Why?             So your answer is yes?             It doesn't matter? Hamburgers are just as good?               Whether they want the protection or not?               And whether a private individual can come and offer them the same protection for less money or not?               We're the government and we're here to help you?                Let's take one of these classic discrimination cases involving milk.                I think what you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would be perfectly okay.                That's right.    And it would really advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it, and really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers, and you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to that.              So long as the government enters the commercial market, it can, it can create              It always benefits the State of California.              And you're saying so long as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great wealth in the State of California, it is okay.              I don't see the distinction as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.                 There is no determinative element in the Pike test whatever.                   It is a totality of the circumstances test, right?                 That's wonderful. (Laughter.)
05-1429 +++$+++                 That's not in the materials, 502(c)?
05-1448 +++$+++                Of course this argument would not have any force whatever if indeed, transferring the assets to another plan does not constitute a termination of the plan.                But the first step would be the transfer.   And at that, at that stage it would not be a termination and therefore it would not be within the authority of the administrator under this provision.                That's fine, but that still does not convert the termination decision into, into a, an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's decision.              Sure, you can oversee it and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in the two-step process but the -- but the determination whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's determination.              But they, but they don't say that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly transform the decision whether to, to transfer as -- as a termination.   You transfer that decision from the plan sponsor to the administrator.              Right.           And -- and the argument your adversaries make is that termination requires that the plan assets be distributed to the beneficiaries.              And that in the case of a merger the assets are not distributed to the beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan, which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan but the beneficiaries of other plans.               Right.           But now, does indeed the transfer here meet the requirement of little (i)?   Does the transferee plan undertake an irrevocable commitment to provide to these beneficiaries all that they're entitled to, even at the expense of some of the other beneficiaries of that plan?                 In other words, if the plan's investments go south does that plan have the authority to say, oh, you know, our first payments have to go to the beneficiaries under this plan that was transferred and the rest of you will get, will get the leavings?     I don't think that the plan has the authority to do that.                Does it make a commitment, a commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities under the now deceased plan?                 The other side said that the district court found that the argument was waived, or the court of appeals did.              Well, I don't think, I just don't read 1341 the way you do.              It seems to me that little (i) at the top of your page 2a is a safe harbor. I don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary decision that he has to, once he has found an insurer that is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the benefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look throughout the rest of the world to see if there is anything that might be better for his plan participants. I think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an irrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that insurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home free.   You're saying he is not home free.              He has to consider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully providing all benefit liabilities might be better for the plan participants.       I -- I think that's, that's placing on him an obligation that I don't see there.
05-1508 +++$+++               Mr. Srinivasan, you don't want us to stretch the language, do you?              And you wouldn't urge us to do either, would you?              Different purposes.              They're for different purposes.               I still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case.               Mr. Srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about.               What I don't understand about the Government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't use it for purposes of (A).            You, you don't -- in the major computation portions, namely for purposes of paragraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it agency by agency, don't you?            You DON'T apply this, you know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency.                  Why don't you do for both?              Right.             You're saying it comes to the same, but the fact remains you don't use that methodology in A, because you don't think the language requires that methodology.          And it is the same language in B.             Well, the purpose would be to follow the language of the statute, and if you think that the language in B requires this kind of an approach you should take the same approach in A, especially if it makes no difference.              Would such be -- of such expenditures or revenues.           That refers back to local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.    It's referring you back not to the totality of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.             Well, you still have a Church of the Holy Trinity team over there somewhere, don't you? (Laughter.)                You know, I really don't care what the Secretary thought he was doing.                      I mean, it seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a member of Congress who voted on this thing have thought he was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this history you're giving us.              And more importantly, what would a citizen to whom this language is promulgated think the language means?              I don't care what the Secretary had in the back of his mind.                      Why should that make any difference to us?               Of such expenditures or revenues.               So you've got to find out what "such" refers to.              Let me --              Let me ask you the same question I asked -- I asked the Government.                    Why don't you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply it to, to 2.A?   You don't even think of doing that in 2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but it's the same language in 2.A.
05-1541 +++$+++               Was, was the more specific statute there enacted after the more general statute?              The reason I ask is we -- we do have a principle which I think is a sound one, that repeals by implication are not fatal.             And what you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that existed under 1346.     Do you know if any of your cases that you cite, even those outside of the Internal Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted after the general statute that they supposedly limit?              Well, I guess --              Well, that's certainly true when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously. Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the more specific one and does not thereby limit the more specific one.    But, well --              Pre-Williams you're talking about?              Did you make that argument, did the Government make that argument, in Williams?              Yes, that -- that Congress had enacted another statute which presumes that there is no cause of action under 1346?                Yes, but even if it wasn't available to her, the fact that there was another statute the whole premise for which is the unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me that would have, that would have strengthened the Government's case in Williams.              I forgot about that footnote. (Laughter.)
05-1575 +++$+++               Excuse me.       I'm looking at page 92 of the joint appendix.              I don't, I don't see that.              Well, that's rather important, don't you think?              Is that effective?         Does the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?              Isn't it your obligation to raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion for rehearing?              But that wasn't your assertion even in this motion for a hearing.              It wasn't that he didn't know what he was giving up.              It was rather the sentencing transcript, you say, "does not establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence.   Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in frustration with his attorney during that particular proceeding."              But that was a factual matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was present at the time.      And he didn't think it was in the heat of anger.   He did think that it was a valid waiver. Now, you're raising a totally different issue.          You're saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all the elements of mitigation that the waiver might embrace.   That wasn't the argument you were making here.              Okay.             This is belt and suspenders, that's all.        The -- I don't think any judge likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver. This judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't waived it there's nothing there --             -- because he wasn't bringing in at this point the biological -- by the way, biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor rather than an aggravating factor?                I don't understand.       It seems unreasonable to me.           He was trying to spare his mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court? That's what he had in mind?               Excuse me.       I'm not following you.   You mean the mental health expert's testimony could have gone to whether the judge should have accepted the waiver?               I thought that's what you were saying, I'm sorry.             Where are you quoting from? I'm sorry.               Mr. Verrilli, I thought you already conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for a hearing on this question of whether he had waived, effectively waived mitigating evidence.               That isn't what the Ninth Circuit said.              It found that he had not waived mitigating evidence.              So what --              Whatever.
05-1589 +++$+++               Is it content discrimination which subjects legislation to strict scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a State designates certain funds for use by school districts to teach patriotism, American history, something like that?       Is that subject to strict scrutiny?              Okay.       Now let's assume it's not Government funding.              Instead of doing that the Government says, you will have authority to collect money from certain people only for a particular purpose. Is that content discrimination which calls into play strict scrutiny?               I don't see why the one is any worse than the other.            The Government has a particular purpose in mind and in one case it gives out money with that purpose in mind, which discriminates of course; in the other case it allows this extraordinary power to exact funds from people, but only for certain purposes.    That's not the kind of content discrimination that they calls strict scrutiny into play, it seems to me.               Here is the Government acting as a coercer.        It's because of the Government that you're allowed to get this money from these non-union members.             Which no longer exists if you don't make a timely objection.              Only if the State has given you the power to exact the money from these people. That changes everything.         If this was money that they had contributed themselves, you'd have a different argument, but the State compels them to give you that money and the State says however, you will not use this money for this purpose without their consent.               That brings us back to the question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to that I don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government gives money for a particular purpose only and not for other purposes, and I also don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government allows a private organization to use governmental power to exact money from people for a particular purpose only.         That's a different ball game.
05-1629 +++$+++               Could I ask a factual question?    I'm just curious.           If the Government's statement of the facts here is correct, your client, a Peruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994, and nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in 1998.   How does that happen?           Is that a mistake or -- how do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent resident?              He's not a joyrider anyway.               You shouldn't steal it for an unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable amount of time?               I don't understand the concept of stealing something for a reasonable amount of time.              You assert, you assert it's consistent with the majority view on this issue, not on everything.    What does it say about the death penalty?                 The joy apparently is you don't get convicted of theft. (Laughter.)              Of course if you're right about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it would still be available to find out whether your client was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.              Now is that -- is it possible?   Or is that out of the question in this case?              Is it possible from pleading documents, from the charge, to determine whether he was convicted as an accessory or not?                         And if it's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our sometime in arguing this point, aren't we?             No, no, no.          It says, "who at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle."                    I mean, he is -- he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, not, not some subsequent accessory.             It is not a question of Cal -- it is a question of English.             We're not saying about what needs to be charged.      We're talking about what was charged.   And it seems to me there's no question what was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle.         There is no way you can consider that an accessory.             But the charging document you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to charge as an accessory?        You would acknowledge this?              Partying maybe I would understand.    I don't know about joyriding.              Wait a minute.   That's a real case?              It sounds like the doctrine of unnatural improbable consequences. (Laughter.)                Let me tell you, what's aberrant is the California interpretation of the standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is you intend the natural and probable consequences of what you do.   And if California has, some California courts have come up with weird notions of that, I don't know that that destroys the uniformity among the states.
05-1631 +++$+++                 It is frightening.                A frightening amount of speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at night, on a two-lane windy road --              But the issue in the case was quite simply whether there had been a seizure. Isn't that the issue?              Not if he is shooting his way out of the house and endangering other people.              I mean, that's a factor here, of course.     If he has taken the jewelry and he's gone off into the night, if shooting at him might endanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to let him go.    I'm talking about a burglar who is, you know, who is shooting as he leaves.                Of course you can shoot him.              Is that a factual finding of the, of the trial court here?              Are we bound by that fact?              Even if having watched the tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be accurate?              Mr. Jones, could I --              Could I ask whether the portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he was not endangering anybody is this portion?                The court is mindful that traffic laws are designed to -- safely -- and Harris acted in an unsafe manner.                However, the record reflects" -- - is this the portion?             "And did not endanger any particular motorist on the road."               I think that's true. In that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting any particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a finding that he was not endangering anybody.               "Any particular motorist," but he was endangering the public at large.             It depends on how fast -- if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a two-lane road or four-lane divided highway.              All those factors come into, into account.              And it doesn't seem to me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will discourage police officers.           There's, there's enough disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the fact that the police officer may hurt himself.              It's pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't you think?   I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.             I would have let the guy go.             Driving 90 miles an hour and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved. Scott could have been killed, couldn't he?             So I don't think we need a whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in engaging in frolicsome conduct.              Did this study show what future fleeing speeders would do? I mean, I will accept that for, for the sake of argument that -- in fact, it's probably true.                  I would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing, you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore.                  But did this study show what the effect of a rule that says stop chasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule would be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or fleeing anybody?
05-18 +++$+++        Before you get past Casey, Casey didn't invent this as a definition.                Casey said it has always meant this in innumerable Federal statutes.         Casey was relying on a longstanding practice which existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced.       Not later ascribe.   I mean, Casey was relying on --            Mr. Vladeck, my -- my problem with the argument you're now making is -- is a little more basic.             Assuming, which I think is a -- is a major assumption, that expenses refers to expert fees, I don't see how it helps your case that in another part of the statute, the statute says, fees, costs, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that we're talking about here, it only refers to fees as part of costs.              How does it help your case that --            -- that elsewhere they go out of their way to add and -- and expenses?                    It seems to me that hurts your case.         Well, then where is the authorization?           I think that's what Justice Alito's question goes to.          You have to come up with some statutory authorization to pay expert fees.                      Now, attorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any costs.       It just says whatever costs are otherwise authorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that.       What is the authorization to pay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees? All -- all this section says is they may award attorneys' fees as part of costs, and costs are presumably elsewhere authorized.       But where is the authorization to pay?       Do you know any State that doesn't have a cost statute?       And that's effective too, as though it were written into the statute, because one committee of Congress said so.               That's effective.       And -- and they read it.       That's the only thing we know for sure that they voted on.       But was this legislation vetoed by the President?       Now, when the President signed it, did -- did he also approve the conference report?        Did he have the conference report in front of him?       He had the statute in front of him, didn't he?       You -- you think he read the conference report too.       What -- what date in -- I mean, so we have two different modes of interpreting statutes:         one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative history, and one post-1988 in which we don't use legislative history?       I mean, that -- that's what you're suggesting, isn't it?       The reason one does not use legislative history, if one does not use it, as I don't -- as I don't, is not because Congress doesn't expect it to be used, but because Congress does not have the power to delegate to one of its committees the content of -- of its statutes.           The Constitution provides that legislation will be passed by two houses and signed by the President, and the problem with legislative history, for those of us who have a problem with it, is this amounts to a delegation by Congress. It's not a matter of what Congress expected. I don't care what Congress expected.                 It can't do it. It can't leave it to a -- to a committee to -- to fill in the blanks in a statute.             That's the problem, and that has nothing to do with expectations.
05-184 +++$+++          I thought --       I thought we -- I thought we established, earlier -- somebody told me -- that, in the normal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is not properly constituted, that claim is not adjudicated immediately, it's adjudicated at the conclusion of the proceeding.       We --       We don't -- we don't intervene on habeas corpus when somebody says that the panel is improperly constituted.           We wait until the proceeding's terminated, normally.            To a forum that is prima facie properly constituted.              I mean, it -- this is not a -- you know, a necktie party.               Where it parades as a court, and it's been constituted as a court, we normally wait until the proceeding's completed.        They could surely --        -- set forth a procedure which amounts to a suspension of the writ.                   And if that procedure is done in a state of insurrection or invasion, that would constitute a suspension of the writ, even though they don't say, "We are suspending the writ of habeas corpus."       I don't think Congress chose to do that.        One house of Congress chose to do it.       We don't know what the other house thought, and we don't know what the President thought.            I'll be interested in your answer, if you can get it out. [Laughter.]       I thought -- I thought -- I thought you said all prisoners of war were uniquely vulnerable -- I thought that was the point you were making --        -- and had -- needed --        -- needed protection of the -- of the supervising powers, or whatever they're called.
05-200 +++$+++        That's uniform in both Alaska and New York, they are subject to the -- to the Blue Cross waiver of attorney's fees or not.            They're being treated uniformly.            I don't see that that's disuniform. What is disuniform, it seems to me, is that you have an employee who wins a judgment in Alaska and he gets to keep all his money because Alaska law says the reimbursement provision is -- is invalid, and then you have a Federal employee in Texas who -- who gets a -- wins the same tort lawsuit, and he has to turn over to Blue Cross all the -- the portion of his recovery that would cover the outlay that Blue Cross has made. That's disuniformity.          The Government -- the Government as amicus?            The Government as amicus.       Of course, you could say the same about -- about any recovery, that a certain percentage in taxes will go to the Federal Treasury I -- I --         Well, I guess you can be -- depending upon how detailed the OPM contract is, you can be consistent with that contract and still have an enormous amount of variation from one to another.                   It depends entirely upon whether the OPM contract is entirely comprehensive.             If it covers every jot and tittle, then I guess you can't be consistent with it and different.           But if it's -- if it's sort of bare bones, you -- you could be consistent with that and have a lot of variation, couldn't you?
05-204 +++$+++             No.    I was going to say I -- if I were gerrymandering, I would absolutely want to leave majority other party districts in which the people from the other party were voting for a candidate from my party with some regularity.                       I'd want to do that.       That's exactly what I'd want a gerrymander to do.        A -- a minority who was a majority.        I'm not sure that Justice Stevens is suggesting that as a standard.                He's suggesting it as a disqualifier.                If it's not as compact, it's no good, but if it is as compact, he's -- I -- I don't think he's suggesting it's okay.                So we still don't have a standard.        A safe harbor from an unknown standard. (Laughter.)           When you're carved out of a couple of preceding districts, which is the preceding district?         I mean, isn't -- isn't that a problem with that test?
05-259 +++$+++         No.     That's his point.       I mean, that's his point, that -- that the one way to avoid the problem is to keep shifting people around.        I don't know if that hurts you or helps you.         I mean, that -- that eliminates what seems to me is the strongest argument of the -- of your side, which is that it makes no sense to impose greater sanctions upon somebody who -- who files a complaint than it does upon somebody who -- who violates somebody's race, religion, or whatever by -- by discriminating.        You're telling me it does make sense, that we've done it in other areas.             And you wouldn't expect me to.     This person has, you know, hauled me onto the block.       Now, am -- am I discriminating against that person?         I'm not?        I'm not treating her the way I did before.         Sort of like taking her to lunch.         Now, you say it -- it has to be part of my -- it doesn't have to relate to her terms and conditions of employment, you say --         -- because it's not the same as 703.        But somehow you say it -- it has to.             Does it have to or not have to?            Yes, I worry about that, as -- as varied as the human imagination.                     Juries can have wonderful imaginations.                I mean, that -- that is the problem.         Is it meant to be this -- this uncontrolled, this uncabined?            What -- what is your criterion that is going to stop every little thing from -- from being deemed a retaliatory measure, such as not saying good morning to this employee?        Yes, I understand that.        But almost any act of his subordinates will be deemed act of the -- of the employer where retaliation is concerned, I'll bet you. What else besides that?        I'll give you causation. But I'm talking about the triviality -- the triviality of the action in question.                  Is there no test that eliminates a trivial action from the aggrieved employee who -- who wants to litigate?        A reasonable person would what -- would what?        A reasonable person would consider it to be?            Adverse.            Why is the EEOC standard any more based in the text of the statute than -- than the standard proposed by your adversary here?             Suppose -- suppose I disagree with you as to the standard, that is, I think 704 and 703 both require something related to the employment.              Would -- what would the outcome be?            Would -- would the case have to go back to be submitted to the jury under that standard?                    What standard did the jury find --                Well, that isn't the test, I mean, whether you can convince a jury. I think you -- you have to acknowledge that -- that before we -- we say that these trial instructions were adequate to -- to give you your victory, we -- we have to find that at least a reasonable jury could conclude under section 703 that -- that both of these -- both of these adverse actions qualified as discrimination under 703, if -- if we're going to use that test.                    Right?      You acknowledge that.                Okay, but that -- that is at least what -- what's before us here, that if -- if we go the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude, in order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could find. This jury did, but we'd have to find that that's reasonable.              Right?          Yes, and the other argument is that if you don't do it, there's no way to -- to get a case dismissed before it goes to a jury.                 You're saying every claim is going to be a jury trial.                  I mean, that -- you know, come on.          But the triviality issue would be out of the case.               No matter how trivial, it goes to a jury.           That's -- that's what you want us to say.        Well, then we have to have some per se rules.
05-260 +++$+++           Well, but I mean, once you get out of the contract terms and are trying to make your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to show that -- that part of the recovery was -- was for the -- for the medical expenses.                   And has that been shown?       You -- you have piqued my curiosity and -- and didn't satisfy it.                You say there are variations on make-whole.               What -- you were about to describe the variations.             What are the variations?        The fact that your equitable claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly doesn't -- doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable claim.       I mean, the classic equitable claim is somebody declaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he declares a trust.        Equity will enforce that trust, but the trust is based on a contractual commitment.                      Right?            I should think your response is that Congress provided for only equitable relief.            And -- and that that's the -- that's the answer.            Congress said that.           Or you might try to get ERISA amended. (Laughter.)       Presumably such a weak -- such a weak claim would not be brought because there --       -- there's nothing at the end of it.
05-352 +++$+++        Well, I think he can also reject an appointed counsel.               Can't he go to the court and say, I -- you know, I don't like this counsel?       Yes, I know it happens.         Or -- or my Uncle Vinnie. What about the real -- the real case of my Uncle Vinnie?        There's --         I don't know -- I don't know whether he was a real estate lawyer or not. (Laughter.)         Are you entitled to represent yourself on appeal?         So --            I'm -- I'm not sure you're properly characterizing the -- the Government's position.         I mean, you -- you don't have to assert that the right is not violated until -- until there's an unfair trial in order to take the position that the Government takes.        I mean, the right -- a lot of rights that are later reviewed for harmless error or for -- to see whether there was prejudice were violated at the time, and not -- not just on the basis of whether there was prejudice or not.       Unless you compel him to seek mandamus on pain of losing the constitutional claim, your -- every incentive is to go right ahead with the trial.       I don't think the mandamus solution works unless you compel mandamus, unless you say you lose -- you lose the claim unless you bring mandamus.          How many -- how many circuits are applying that rule?
05-380 +++$+++ 
05-381 +++$+++              It's ultimately a jury question, I assume.             But that question was not put to the jury, right?              I'm losing you.    What's the second point that they're trying to make besides the fact that this didn't conform to Brooke Group?              Regardless of Brooke Group.
05-409 +++$+++ 
05-416 +++$+++         I would -- I would not describe "exhaustion" that way.          I would -- I would describe a failure to file within the prescribed time, not as an exhaustion of remedies, but as a failure to exhaust remedies.         I mean, I guess I'm having a terminological problem in this case, as I did in the previous case.        Yes, well, we're talking about administrative law, which is a field I used to know something about, and I've never thought "exhaustion" included "failure to exhaust," which --        -- which is --        -- what happens when you simply don't file within the prescribed period.        But how does it do that?     I mean, if there's any object that Congress had in mind, surely it was to reduce the number of frivolous prisoner claims that are coming into Federal district courts.                And it hoped to do this by sending the -- making sure that they went through the prison system first.             Whether we looked at what the prison system did or not, we hoped that the prison system would get rid of a large -- a large number of these frivolous claims. Now, can you tell me how that purpose is possibly served --         -- by saying, "Do nothing.             So long as you don't even try to go through the prison grievance system, you can come directly into court."                       It seems to me this --         -- this --         Oh, no, "You -- you have to go there late.          You" --         -- "you just sit around until it's too late, file a grievance that you know will not be accepted, because it's too late, and then you can come into Federal Court."           This is going to cut back considerably on the number of frivolous claims?       Maybe because they thought they had to file on time.        And the more frivolous the case, the more likely it is that it won't be remembered by a guard.         I mean, you know, the suit is, "A guard spat on my painting," or something like that, you know.            Who's going to remember anything like that 4 months later?       It seems to me you're understating the amount of time that he's saving by failing to exhaust.           It's not just if he waits six months and then puts it in.          If he had filed within the right period, he would get a hearing at one level.                 And there may be as many as two other levels of review before he's fully off -- before he's fully exhausted.                  Now, here's a guy who -- you know, he's lying around in jail.                  He's -- this is a frivolous filer.           He wants to get out of the jail, downtown, you know, to the district court in L.A., where he can look at the beautiful people and relieve the humdrum of prison life.           He wants to get to district court as soon as he can.       Why is that procedural rule binding on him, but the time procedural rule not binding on him?        I don't know why.     I mean, if --           -- they're procedural rules, you have to set it forth in a comprehensible manner, and you have to be on time.
05-465 +++$+++        I don't see how your point regarding union helps you any because if -- if you -- if you win the point that union doesn't mean a labor union, you still have, as -- as the end of this definition, any union or group of individuals.       A union of individuals or a group of individuals.          You're still stuck with individuals.       Either union means labor union or it means a union or group of individuals.       Okay.       I'll give you that.          Then -- then it means a union or group of individuals.       Right.      So, you know, you're just as bad off.       Yes, but Reves demonstrates that -- that your statement earlier that since it was fraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business of the corporation is simply false.                    We -- we haven't held that whenever a corporation violates the law, it goes beyond its business, although in a sense it does. In Reves, we -- we said it didn't.       I understand that, but that's -- we have to get into that is my point.                     We can't just say since providing them with -- with phony ID's is unlawful, it can't be the business of the corporation.          Do -- do any of those cases that you allude to that have means in some sections, includes in others -- do any of them have in third sections, includes, comma, without limitation, comma?          Well, I think that's a big difference.       Close enough.       Mr. Stewart, this -- this thing is at least -- at least -- ambiguous.                    Why shouldn't we apply the rule that we normally apply with regard to criminal statutes that where there is an ambiguity, the rule of lenity applies and we shouldn't give the -- the Government license to -- to ride closer herd than -- than is clear in the statute?                   Why isn't -- why isn't that an easy way to --       -- resolve this question?       That's irrelevant because it's not taken alone.           It is defined.         So the only -- the only question is what this -- what this definition means.       Is it exclusive or not exclusive?             That's really the only issue.       Even -- even when it's absolutely clear and -- and as pointed out by -- by your friend, you -- you did not refute the point that in other sections where it says includes, it is unquestionable that it is exclusive.       What's the best court of appeals opinion, the most thoroughly considered?            I haven't read any of them.            Tell me -- tell me the best one.        I'd like to read it.
05-493 +++$+++            It's on page 9 of your -- of your brief.    The --           -- italicized portion.            Only if you think that excusing the crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same thing, which I don't really think.           Yes, but what has to be clear under Teague is not just the rule, but the rule's application in circumstances like this.                 There are a lot of rules that are clear, but if Teague means anything at all it has to mean that you should have known that, in this case, the rule would produce this result.                 So it's not enough to say that there was a rule.                  There are a lot of rules out there, but the question is whether the outcome should have been clear at the time.                 Isn't that what Teague means?            If the judge's response to Juror Hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to it, if it was as obviously misleading as you say?            That's why you have counsel there, to help the court when the court makes a real boo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say, one would have expected some objection from defense counsel.
05-502 +++$+++        Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the police did here.         As -- as I recall, they -- before they went in, they -- they heard all this noise and they saw the punch.         They pushed open the screen door and announced that they were the police.               Okay?       And then only went in when nobody heard them.        Then they shouted even louder, police.        I'm not sure that -- that just the noise wouldn't be enough to allow that.                If you can't hear the policeman from the door, who's coming to check about a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock on the door, can the policeman not open the door and shout, police?           Is that an unreasonable search and seizure. And then if you don't hear that, can he take two steps into the house?              He's -- he's not looking under the carpets.          He's not looking in the desk drawers.         He's just shouting police so that he can bring to the attention of the people there the fact that there's been a complaint from the neighbors and you have to knock off the noise.                  I -- I would think that's perfectly reasonable.                 Never mind the punch in the nose.        They didn't hear him when he -- when he just opened the screen door.                 He had to step in a few more -- a few more steps.                  Then they finally heard him.          That's his -- the way I understand these facts.        Of course, he had to raise his voice.          I mean, there was a lot of noise going. It just seems to me so unreasonable, when a policeman comes to tell people they're making too much noise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't do the minimum that's necessary to get their attention so he can tell them that.             He has to go get a warrant to tell them that the neighbors are complaining about too much noise?          That just seems absurd.       I don't understand that.            Where is it?      Where is it?         You know, maybe -- maybe you're taking our announce and a knock -- knock and announce requirement too -- too seriously or too literally.          I mean, if a police officer comes up and the door is open, what does he have to do?                  Lean over and knock on the side of the door?                   Can't he shout, hello, police?           Don't you think that satisfies a knock and announce requirement?         You really think you got to knock even when the door is open.         Okay.      And he did that here.         He stood at the door.       He opened the screen door and said, police --       -- which he thought would be more effective than knocking on -- on the -- you know, the -- the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a very good knock. (Laughter.)
05-5224 +++$+++           Like what is his name?         I mean, that's the present tense.                  Not what was his name or what will be his name.               What is his name?         You think that's the present tense.               So that shows that this is all seeking help.        You know, powerful is part of the problem.          This -- this kind of telephone call evidence is even more powerful than -- than the kind of a signed affidavit that used to be banned because it was testimonial.          I mean, to hear -- to hear the voice on the phone makes it, if it is -- if it is impermissible under the Confrontation Clause, it makes it even a more damaging violation than the kind of violation that -- that occurred in -- in Sir Walter Raleigh's case, for example.       Would you -- would you rather put the woman on -- if you had a choice, would you rather put the woman on the stand?       Rather than have her -- her voice on the telephone call --       -- when she is -- she is in -- in -- supposedly in great fear of -- of her husband and -- and -- I'm sure you'd rather have the telephone call.       As a prosecutor.       I think it would be an easy choice.       Let's -- let's not overread Crawford.         Crawford didn't say that the only thing the Confrontation Clause was directed at was the kind of abuse that -- that occurred in the case of Sir Walter Raleigh.         It said that that was the principal abuse at which it was directed.           I doubt very much, unless you think otherwise, that if somebody, without provocation from the police, wrote up an affidavit, signed the affidavit, and gave it to the police, I doubt whether that would have been allowed under the Confrontation Clause.        Do you think it would have?       Your test wouldn't cover the example I just gave.       And you think that that should be admissible in a criminal trial?       Well --            Oh, now the person disappears afterwards, is unavailable.            I can't imagine that that wouldn't have been covered by the Confrontation Clause --            -- such -- such an obvious violation of your right to confront your accuser, and just because it was presented to the police without -- without an initial interrogation by the police, I don't think that would have made any difference at common law.       I agree that that's the extreme, but you're urging us to -- to adopt a test that embraces only the extreme and does not embrace the hypothetical I just gave you.              And you -- you can accept that hypothetical without saying that you lose this case, but it seems to me the test you're proposing is -- is really quite extreme.       What -- what do we do about the -- about the fact, which I don't think you -- you deny and -- and the -- the other side points out in both of these cases that, in fact, police departments have their responders to the 911 number intentionally ask a series of questions that gives them all the information they need to conduct a prosecution?                   In other words, they are using 911 as a -- as a prosecutorial device.        Disappearing.        Not just not appearing.          Disappearing.           Well, the husband had left the house here, as I understand it, when this -- when this call occurred.       She -- she wanted the man arrested, but he was no longer in the house, was he?       What do you mean by seeking help?       I mean, it seems to me you're saying seeking help means trying to get somebody arrested, trying to get somebody who has harmed you arrested.                    In this case, he was gone out of the house.                    She had gone and locked the door before she came back to the phone and gave most of this testimony.       And -- and in the -- in the jeweler case, the guy is running down the street.                      What is the jeweler -- is the jeweler really worried about the guy turning around and coming back to rob some more?       He wants the man arrested.       Well, it's -- it's -- it may be not a lot, but it's something.                You don't have anything to the contrary.       You don't have anything which shows that these hue and cry reports were admitted, and there were a lot of them.                They -- they were done regularly.       I would say that a hue and cry report is not the same as a woman being beaten and -- and picking up the phone while the crime is in progress.         But I think it's quite similar to the -- the jewelry hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you which you're unwilling to say is -- is not covered by the -- is covered by the Confrontation Clause, and I think it's quite similar to a woman, where the husband has left and she's locked the door and she wants the husband arrested.        I think it's quite similar to that. But for the telephone, it's -- it's someone who's been the victim of a crime who goes to a public official, as soon as possible, and says, I've been -- I've been subject to a crime.         I want to report the crime and have the person arrested.            I think it's very similar.         And you wouldn't say that every question asked in that context.                    Don't we have to do it question by question?               I mean, what if one of the questions was, you know, has he beaten you before?                      How many times before?        You know, are you going to allow that in too --       -- as an excited utterance?
05-547 +++$+++         I thought the Government has taken the position -- and as far as I know, all the Courts of Appeals have bought the Government's argument -- that there -- you do not need a conviction --        -- that so --        Yes.      You don't --        Yes, but --        -- but 924(c) is incorporated in 1101(a)(43).    It's --        -- incorporated.         So, you want us to interpret 924(c) one way for criminal convictions -- a criminal sentence -- that is, you don't need a conviction in order to get the enhancement -- but another way for --           -- for the INA?           Why is --           -- that?          Well, but you don't -- you don't look to the jurisdiction of conviction.              Are you telling me you require a conviction?             You -- I thought you told me you don't require a conviction.          Mr. Kneedler, could --          Sure.          Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you about your assertion that you "look to the State of conviction"?     What do you mean by that?         For purposes of 1101.   Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State court, of a misdemeanor -- and even though that action would be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?          So, it's sort of a double inconsistency.     Not only do you treat State -- State actions that are -- that are minimal -- I'm sorry, where the State treats it more seriously than the Federal Government, not only do you follow the State, but, where the State treats it less leniently than the Federal Government, you also follow the State.        Is that right?        So, you look to the State of conviction.   What --        That's for purposes of the immigration law.        Okay.      Now, do you do the same for purposes of the felony enhancement provision?        You --        Well, that seems to me --        -- very strange.      You would look to the -- you would look to the State law for purposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of 924(c), what would you look to?          Either one.   Either one. Whichever --         -- whichever -- for 924 -- whichever one would make it a felony.         You lose.         Yes.         Right.         All right.         If it's a felony under either one, for purposes of 924(c), you lose, right?         If the act is either a State felony or a Federal felony, you lose.           I mean, the defendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?         No?          Well --          Listen.          Listen.         My question is a simple one.   If it's -- it seems to me, if it's -- what you're saying is, if it is either a felony under Federal law or a felony under State law, you get the enhanced sentence under 924(c), isn't that right?          I thought that's --          -- what the whole argument is about, whether it has to be a felony under Federal law. You're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under Federal law, that you don't get --          -- the enhanced sentence?          You've thoroughly confused me now.         Never mind sentencing, let's get back to the immigration.           If I understand what you're now saying, if you're convicted in State Court of action that is a Federal felony, but it's just a State misdemeanor -- right? -- you look to the State of conviction, and it would be a misdemeanor, and the immigration provisions would not -- would not take effect. Is --         -- that right?           That's extraordinary.
05-593 +++$+++            What does that mean?         Does that mean that if the district court finds that in fact the defendant was not acting within the scope of his employment, the United States is eliminated as the defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?             Where, where does that come from?             Maybe the United States should remain the party defendant and the United States should pay which would be the, you know, the price of the Attorney General's certification.             He should be careful what he certifies.            That's, that's what the district court said it was, though, isn't it?                Didn't it -- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of jurisdiction?           So you want us to review the, the assertion of the district court that it was remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would, would be reviewable.          Mr. Grant, could I come back for -- I'm sorry.    I have the wrong counsel.           Mr. Hallward-Driemeier --          What is your response to the application of 1447(d)?        You say that it does not apply where it's apparent on the face that the remand is improper?          Right, right.          Wouldn't somebody always be able to bring an appeal asserting that to be the case --          And wouldn't that destroy the whole purpose of 1447(d), which is to stop this ping-pong?          But the response to that is that our opinions show that even an erroneous remand is nonetheless governed by 1447(d).            There are a lot of erroneous remands and this would just be, just be another one.
05-595 +++$+++               Is that the case in Federal courts, too?              I mean, it is conceivable that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway.              In which case you shouldn't be making this argument because it applies only to state courts.              -- that the new rule produced greater accuracy.          We said that it was the view of the framers of the Constitution that cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was necessary for greater accuracy. Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of things?   I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is what the Constitution required and what the framers thought were necessary. Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're arguing about here, to what the framers think?                 I think that discussion of the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of justifying the overruling of a case that -- you know -- that was not that old.         It hadn't worked out as well as we maybe expected it would.              But I don't think it was for the purpose of showing that it always produces unreliable results.
05-5966 +++$+++        Have we ever held that an insanity defense is required, that a State cannot simply abolish insanity defenses?       I didn't we had.
05-5992 +++$+++          What -- what are you hypothesizing?           That the court actually made this finding in its mind but just didn't express it?             Or are you hypothesizing that the court could have made it but didn't make it, never even went through the mental process?       Could have made it.   So -- so we're going to -- why can't life be simple?             We're going to have to have trials all the time as to whether, in this hypothetical situation, this finding could have been made.          I mean, you know, this creates subsidiary litigation that we really don't need.       But, you know, Congress could have -- could have written it the way -- the way you're proposing it.         Congress could have said, you know, when there -- when -- when there is good cause for the continuance, the clock won't run.                  It didn't say that.         It -- it said the judge has to make a finding.         I mean, don't we have to give that some effect? You're saying it really doesn't matter whether he makes the finding or not.                   So long as there was good cause so that a finding could have been made, that will be enough.       Except -- except where there's a public policy against what you want to estop him into doing.          I mean, it seems to me for the same reason that you don't allow a waiver, you shouldn't allow an estoppel.          There's a public policy against it. The -- the Congress wanted these things tried promptly, and -- and whether he merely waives or -- or goes further and affirmatively causes the court to do something which it shouldn't have done, you're just as much violating the policy it seems to me.       If -- if what you say is true, I don't know why it makes any difference that the defendant led the court into it.                If you -- if you believe that this is just a procedural nicety that was not complied with, why shouldn't you do the same thing when -- when the court fails to make the finding but could have made the finding whether or not the defendant was the one that led him into it?       Yes, within 70 relevant days counted as the statute requires them to be counted, which includes the requirement of this finding set forth in the record before you can stop the clock running for -- you know, for some period.                I don't think that that's -- I don't think that's very complicated.           But it was not known at the time that he was incompetent.                  And -- and therefore, that could not have been the reason that he was not being tried.             The reason he was not being tried was that the -- that there was pending before the judge the inquiry into whether he was competent.       You really don't know the answer of whether the clock is running until the finding is made.         If the -- if the judge finds that -- that he's not incompetent, well, too bad.               You know, the Speedy Trial Act requires dismissal.               On the other hand, if the judge finds that he is incompetent to be tried, there hasn't been a violation of the act.               I mean, it's a very strange situation. And it also, as -- as the -- the other side points out, it -- it puts considerable pressure on the judge when -- when he is in violation of the Speedy Trial Act, to find that the individual is incompetent because, otherwise, there has to be a dismissal.           Isn't -- isn't that so? (Laughter.)

05-6551 +++$+++            That's not so at all.         California says if you go over the middle range, it is unreasonable, period, unless you prove or you find one of the aggravating factors.       That's a constraint.          You cannot go above the middle range.           No, that's not what we found in Booker.   We found in Booker, or at least the way the lower Federal courts have been interpreting Booker, if you use the guideline range, and you're within the guideline range, that is automatically reasonable, you don't have to worry about it. But we haven't held, and I don't believe most of the Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the guideline range, it is automatically unreasonable.                 And that is the case with the California system, if you go beyond the middle range, it is automatically unreasonable unless you -- unless you find one of the aggravating facts.        But the justification under the Federal system could be, you know, this is what the sentencing commission thought was a reasonable sentence for this crime.    I disagree with that.                 Now, there are other authorities who think that that's a little too, you know, below what it ought to be.                He can simply disagree with the sentencing guidelines. Or he could point out what Justice Breyer suggests, well, the sentencing guidelines may be okay for some jurisdictions, but in this jurisdiction, we have a special problem with regard to this kind of a crime.                  He can do that and doesn't have to find any special fact. He cannot do that in California.          It isn't the same in the Federal guidelines.   Under the Federal guidelines, the judge could say, you know, I think this offense is more serious than what the sentencing commission thought, and these are my reasons for it.       There was a dissent, you know -- the sentencing commission's determinations are reasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable disposition. And it is open to a Federal district judge to say, well, that's what they thought, and I took it into account, and I seriously considered it, and I think they are wrong on this, I think this is more serious.            And that could be a perfectly reasonable determination.               That couldn't be done in California.         Well, it's not true.          You certainly didn't argue that way in your papers up to now. I thought that there has to be a finding of some aggravating factor, not simply, I think deterrence is more than what the statute says, or deterrence requires more than what the statute says.                 Is that really your position, that if a judge thinks deterrence requires more than the middle range, for that reason alone, he can say I ignore the middle range?         Where --           You say in your brief, which doesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying here, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example, by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing scheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. There's no indication there that the judge could just say, I think more deterrence is necessary and therefore, I'm going to exceed the base range.                     That's just totally incompatible with that.            Well, but they have to be an aggravating factor.            And to talk about the need for more deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an aggravating factor.            That's not an aggravating factor. It's a basis for imposing a harsher sentence, but it doesn't aggravate this crime as opposed to the same crime committed by other individuals.                It's not an aggravating factor.          I think the California Supreme Court and the California legislature would be astounded to think that this is what they have wrought.             They obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the judge would apply the middle range, not using his own perception as to whether more punishment is justified or not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime that make this person more guilty, and that's what you usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact that you believe the crime should bear -- in general, should bear, a higher penalty.             I think they would be astounded to find that this is what they have created.            Would you want us to hold that, you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion that says what California's sentencing judges may do under California law, as you've described it to us, is that they -- they may exceed the middle range whenever they think that that is a better result, whenever they think that that's reasonable?            And you think California would be happy with that?            Well, including reasonable disagreement with the level of severity that the legislature has provided in the middle term.              I mean, other legislatures may have provided higher severity and the judge says, I simply disagree with the California legislature.     And it's a reasonable disagreement, because some other legislature might have done what I do.            That isn't reasonable?       Why isn't it reasonable?          He ties it to that.               He says, I just disagree with the California legislature as to whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from committing this kind of a crime.               And look -- and he cites another state which provides a much higher sentence for the same crime.     Can that possibly be unreasonable?          Then you don't mean reasonableness.   You mean something else.          Do you know of any case in which a California trial judge has gone beyond the middle range not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that the punishment should be greater, something along the lines of what Justice Breyer suggested?          I'm not either, and I would be astounded if any trial judge would read these statutes and court rules that way.
05-669 +++$+++           It often does.      It often does. But it does not, universally.           And there are a number of instances cited by the Petitioner that -- where this Court and -- and statutes use the term in context where it clearly applies to administrative proceedings.          So, the question is, How -- you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case?          And I find it pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations whatever for the Government in these cases.            Wait.            Excuse me.       And this was the Congress that enacted what?            Oh.            Which is not what we're talking about here.         As late as 1978, the Justice Department didn't think that way, did it?         The opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner here would urge.         But -- excuse me -- how could OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings? I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings.          I mean, that's the point. Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the Justice Department was that this statute relates to administrative proceedings.         Do we have --         -- that opinion, by the way? Both sides cited it.     The -- is it -- it was unpublished.         Does anybody give it to us?         Yes, I know they did offer, but nobody did it.         Good.      I would like that.            How about the initial letter that, in the agency practice, precedes the order?             I gather there's a letter to the --            Sounds to me like a complaint, a response --            -- and an adjudication.         I mean, you know --            -- "We think you owe this."            The response comes back, "I don't think we owe it, and here's why."               And then there's a ruling, "You do owe it."           And that's the order.      And then you can appeal it.          And the CFR refers to it as an appeal.         It does not --         -- assert that there's a discrepancy?         Do we have an example of issue letters anywhere?   That's not in the materials either, is it?   In the --         Right.        I don't think so.          I tried to figure that out.    I think --        I think --        Okay.        How do you defend against a claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years ago?        I -- I'm really very reluctant to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the statute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years later, and say, "Oh, by the way, you owe all this money."        The company says "Gee, I -- you know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago."        Say that again.      Until 1966, there were no statute of limitations against any Government suits?         He didn't apply against the Government either.          That's another indication.      Why would you allow them to destroy those records after 6 years if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that there was no statute of limitations to claims for these things?   I mean, that's just another inconsistency that -- in the statutory scheme that's created.         You say, "You can destroy your records after 6 years."      Well, why?           It doesn't make any sense.         Yes.           Well, except when you -- when you say "this legislation," you limit it to the body of 2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's "one."    Is it?   Little -- or --           It's (i).          I mean, that clearly does apply to administrative proceedings.                  And I could understand the argument that Congress was just making things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to administrative proceedings.             I could understand that argument if the way (i) was written is, "The provisions of this section shall not apply to administrative proceedings."      And then I would say, "You know, oh, well, that was always the case, and this is just making it clear." It doesn't say that.            It says that -- the only administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these offsets.        And, you know, the normal rule is inclusio unius, exclusio alterius.            I would -- it means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this section was adopted this year, and the other section was adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action" is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.        That's the best thing you have going for you, really, the strict construction canon.          What if I didn't think the order was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter was a complaint?   Would the Petitioner lose?          Because they never made that argument.          Yes.         Even if you have an administrative proceeding which is called a "complaint"? You know, I mean -- and some are, I think.         And that would not be covered by 2415(a).         And let's assume all those terms are used in the agency procedure.              They're talking about "action," "right of action."              All those terms are used in the agency's procedural rules.             Would they then come under this thing?         I think you have to say no --         -- because, otherwise, it would be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to come in or out, right?         Yes.
05-705 +++$+++          What can't -- what can't be sucked in under section 201?             I mean, once the FCC issues a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust.     And that's what's happened here. And this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation. It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a nullity.         No, I'm saying you'd have to argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case is correct.   Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust. Failing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust.         So can -- every FCC regulation can be enforceable by private action?             All the FCC has to say is that violation of this regulation is unjust.         No?         But at least -- at least any FCC regulations relating to charges, practices -- and you want to interpret practices very broadly -- classifications, and regulations for and in connection with communication service, all of those regulations can be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is, in our view, unjust.         I don't think he's saying that. I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under regulation, it can't be unjust.           Some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. It didn't have to be this scheme.            It could have been some other scheme.    Nothing in the nature of things says that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this. It rather was simply imposed by the FCC.                That's fine.   But to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.         But the rate regulation is -- is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires.      And 276 is something quite different.         Well, but wait.        Wait. Wait.     It says to furnish such communications service, is what (a) says.     And they don't furnish such communications service to your client.         Such communications service.         And I would think that would mean such communications service that was furnished.         Well, except that it is none of their business.         We --         Well, you should be arguing, then, that we should give Chevron deference to the Commission's interpretation of Section 208.        And once we do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.         I thought you should be.         Well, but they're certainly entitled to deference as to whether an administrative action can be brought under 208.         Once you say that it can, then a court action can be brought under 206.          So you think we don't owe them deference for 206, but we do for 208.                And if you give deference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself.          Yes.         Depending upon how broadly you think Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the terms of this statute.      I mean, your interpretation means Sandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot.         Yeah, but you could say any violation of a regulation is unjust.         So Sandoval doesn't mean a heck of a lot.    All the FCC has to say is, we think violation of this regulation is unjust.
05-7053 +++$+++        Good catch.       The Government wouldn't -- wouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case.                    It would just have to prove hate.       And to the extent that duress undermines that, it would be a defense considered by the jury on the hate question.        What -- what if you're a judge like me who -- who thinks that any significant element of -- of the criminal law, when the Due Process Clause was -- was adopted, remains in effect and it doesn't change with the times as you seem -- as your last comment seems to have said?               What do I do with a case like Davis?         Not a case like.         What do I do with Davis?       Davis tells me that this was the common law when the Due Process Clause was adopted.        No?        Oh, I know it was not a constitutional holding, but --        I'll have to go back and look at it.        Okay.         Of course, in the vast majority of criminal cases, there's no doubt that the person did the crime.               And so the -- the benefit to the Government is just carrying coals to Newcastle.                    The -- the defendant would plead guilty but for the fact that he has a plausible coercion defense, and so he puts that coercion defense before the jury, and oh, sure, he does let the -- the Government cross-examine him.                     But the Government really doesn't need his cross- examination in the ordinary case.                     Isn't that right?            And I -- I guess the only way we could really tell what the consequences are, as Justice Breyer would -- would like us to be able to tell, is to know how many people who have gotten off on the basis of this defense have gone on to continue a life of crime.              And -- and we don't have any stats on that --            We never know the consequences of our decisions, by and large, do we? (Laughter.)            Who -- who develops the Model Penal Code?             Is that the American Law Institute that does that?            Which once upon a time purported to simply be embodying the -- the general law, the common law.              But it doesn't even purport to do that anymore.            There are a lot of law professors involved in it, aren't there?       Mr. Gornstein, just out of curiosity, of the 29 States that have the different rule, in how many of those States was the different rule adopted legislatively and in how many States was it pronounced by the State supreme court?       Maybe your -- your friend on the other side knows.       Clear and convincing.
05-7058 +++$+++               Miss Olivieri, you also rely on the "no action shall be brought" language to justify dismissal of the entire action, all claims, even though only some of them have not been exhausted.                  Do you have any, even a single example of the many other instances where that language is used in the Federal statutes?   And there are many of them.                 Do you know any other case where it's been interpreted that way, so that claims that are perfectly valid will not be retained, but rather the whole action will be dismissed?              Right.             What is the basis in the habeas context for dismissing the entire habeas application despite the fact that some of the claims have been exhausted?      Is there any statutory basis for that or is it just, just judicial efficiency?              But your answer was it shouldn't, I think.      I think she's making your argument for you.              I think she is saying that we should treat this area the same way we treat habeas, so that the whole case should be dismissed rather than just the individual claims, which is what I think you want; isn't it?              Okay.       Well, don't fight it.               The same arguments apply in habeas, don't they?               Not if you had your way.               I think you're making an argument that it would preclude that too.               So it seems to me that if we accept your response to Justice Ginsburg, we've got to go back and to the extent that we can do anything about it, we'd better toughen up habeas so that these things get thrown out more readily.             And then sometimes it's impossible to complete the exhaustion.                   I assume in some cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have expired, right?
05-746 +++$+++          Yeah, but your example of other instances including having to compare a defendant who did the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory negligence, that's not what we have here.             We have here a difference in the causation.             Intentional or non-intentional has nothing to do with causation. But once you say that there's a difference in the causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two. You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using the same kind of a standard. I mean, let's assume that you find that the railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly contributory to it.       What do I do?              Do I add another 40 percent to his culpability because it was -- his causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?         Why not?         No, it doesn't.           It certainly bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it seems to me.             Answer the question, Justice Souter.     Yes or no.          Can you have more than one proximate cause?          Of course.            So then how can "in whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause requirement, because it could be in part and still be a proximate cause.   How can that language possibly be interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?       How can you say no when you acknowledge that the prior law when there was contributory negligence used to require proximate cause for both the negligence of the defendant and for the contributory negligence of the defendant?             Such a situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't have to be the sole cause.         It can be just the cause in part, right?       So the mere fact that we had contributory negligence statutes that were applying proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a proximate cause can be a cause in part.          It doesn't seem to me that slight is the opposite of proximate.              It could be a slight proximate cause.        It is not the kind of change anybody would have relied on, is it?             I mean, I find it hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.        I find it hard to see any reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation. Is there anybody doing something differently because they believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of proximate causality?      Does anybody act differently because of that rule?        I don't think so.
05-785 +++$+++          Repeated later in opinions for the majority, I think.         In later cases, so I mean --         Don't just put it in Brennan's dissent.         Yeah, but there is a First Amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of people other than the prosecution, people other than the state, who is bringing this prosecution.         So that makes it a different case.   It makes it very hard to say, well, the Supreme Court's already decided this matter.          Sure, it may come out the way -- it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say that the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the First Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to wear buttons or cry or --          Well, but that cuts against you.           Let's assume -- risk of what? That's what I'm puzzled by.              Let's assume that the buttons were big enough that they could recognize that the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose murder the trial was about.              Let's assume all that.      What risk is that? You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh, he caused so much grief to so many people, once we found him guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence. But during the guilt trial?              I mean, I see, gee, the victim's family loved him a lot.                This guy must be guilty.    That doesn't follow at all. In the guilt phase, I don't see how that can have any effect on the jury.           I don't see the possibility.           You tell me that --           Is there a real possibility that a jury is going to say, since this man's -- this victim's family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?          Well, that's just because we haven't had a First Amendment case yet.                 I mean, we just have parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial for the defendant, for the state.                Let's wait until the ACLU brings a case about people who want to wear buttons in court.   Then you're going to have people arguing, people ought to be able to wear buttons, just as they can wear a shirt that says "Blip the Draft."

05-848 +++$+++             Who was saying that?              That's the NSPS section.              They say that that provision only applies when there is no SIP.                    And that's not this case.             I don't understand that. It seems to me each part has had different definitions and this definition only applies to part 52 which applies when there is no SIP.             I don't know how you can say it automatically applies when there is a SIP.             Part 51, in other words.          Mr. Phillips, before you get away from this section 52, because I think that is the best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is there any sensible reason why you would want to have a different definition of modification for non-SIP situations than you would for SIP situations?             That occurred to me when--             You're quoting page 9?             Oh, in their reply brief?          It's definitely no. (Laughter.)          Well, I think what's wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program has to mean the same as modification in the other.              If you didn't say that, that would be the result.              You give modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable here.   You give it whatever reading you think is reasonable in the other place.           But when you say the two have to be the same, it seems to me you have something else in mind.              It's not just a matter of using the same word.              It's a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning.           -- to the PSD?
05-85 +++$+++               Can I, -- I'm not sure it is even that he made a mistake.               It is even worse than that.    If he gets it right and finds that you are a sovereign --              -- you can go back to State court.    I mean, that's even worse.                He gets it right.                -- that what 1447(d) means is that you can be tried in State courts.                  That's precisely what it says.               I recommend that. (Laughter.)
05-8794 +++$+++           Why is that?      Why is that? That -- that -- in which case it would be like -- like Heck.       Right?       It would come within the Heck principles.       I didn't -- I didn't get your explanation.        Had you finished it?         I don't think -- I don't think that's the research they would do.                    I think the research they would do would be to come up with another method that the State certainly would not find acceptable, thereupon, rendering it a 1983 action and -- and leaving everything in the same status that it's -- that it is here.         I mean, I don't see that you've accomplished anything by simply demanding that they -- that they come up with an alternative.                    They're going to come up with a -- with an unacceptable alternative.       It -- it might be malpractice not to come up with -- with an unacceptable alternative. (Laughter.)           We've -- we've never held that anyway, have we?           That the State must, in -- in imposing the death penalty, use a method that inflicts the least amount of pain.
05-8820 +++$+++                I think what you're saying, though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions to make sense.   Surely that's a sound principle, isn't it?                Can I ask -- it seems very strange to me.     I can understand protective filings when you've lost, but it seems to me a very strange protective filing.      When you've won in state court and the government has taken certiorari, can you file, file in Federal district court?            What do you say?    What are you complaining about?              No.     It's their point.       I don't see how it's your point.                 How can you cover yourself?     I mean, if we come out your way, how -- how --              Would you advise a client that way?    Would you advise a client that way?             You've won here and the state is taking certiorari to the Supreme Court.                  Don't worry about making a protective filing in the district court because, you know, if by chance the Supreme Court reverses, equitable tolling will apply.                  You know, you roll the dice with equity.             I agree.              Is it, is it clear that he can go to district -- I mean, I'm not familiar with how these things work.      Is it possible that when there is an appeal or certiorari pending here there can be proceeding in district court a habeas action on the same, on the same matter that we are considering on certiorari?              District courts do that?       I mean, they would be considering the same, the same issues we are, I suppose?             You're sure that happens, that while cert is pending here there is a habeas proceeding ongoing in district court?             Well, I mean, it sort of depends on how often cert is going to be granted, doesn't it?    If you're a district court and you have hundreds of these habeas petitions being filed, you can either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed, one in one thousand or whatever the number is, because they might be granted.        I think you'd probably take your chances depending on the petition.                  If it looks serious and there's a petition pending you don't have to proceed.    If it's frivolous perhaps you can proceed.              Let me be clear on your answer to Justice Stevens' earlier question.                Where there is a reversal of the state judgment by, by this Court, and the case is remanded to the state, you don't argue that what occurs then is equitable tolling?                But you say that the case is again pending once it goes back to the state, is that right?
05-908 +++$+++                  Mr. Madden, that's certainly an admirable goal.              Could a local unit, a municipality, or even a State have another goal?                    Let's say what used to be great about the United States was the presence of various ethnic groups.                    I mean, there were the Pennsylvania Dutch, there were the Amish, there were Little Italy's, there were Chinatowns, and these things are beginning to disappear.                   And we think that we should encourage the continuation of that diversity, as the Federal Government has done with respect to American Indian tribes. And therefore, we're going to use public funds for such things as street festivals, a Chinatown street festival, an Italian street festival.                    We're going to encourage those organizations that maintain that separateness. Is there anything unconstitutional about that objective?              About the objective?    I mean, think we should foster separateness?               Is there anything wrong --              Fine -- it would be problematic?              Why?              Please let me finish the line of questioning. Assume with me that it is not an unconstitutional objective, which I am sure it's not. Could the -- could the government achieve that objective by barring people from moving into Little Italy or giving a preference to some people to buy real estate in Little Italy if they are of Italian ancestry?             Could it do that?   Absolutely not, right?              So it would appear that even if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by any means whatever.     And the mere fact that the objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is perfectly all right, although certainly not the only objective in the world.        The mere fact that it's okay doesn't mean you can achieve it by any means whatever?              Do you have quotas for, for racial hiring of your faculty in these schools?              Why not?             To say segregated, segregated -- you refer to some of the schools as segregated.    And I, that's not what I understand by segregated.              I mean, you know, if you belong to a country club that, that -- that has 15 percent black members, I would not consider that a segregated country club.           So what you are complaining about is, is not segregation in any, in any reasonable sense of the word.      You're complaining about a lack of racial balance.              That's the only meaning of segregation.              You're talking about racial balance.             Well, I think you're also --              What criteria of race does the school, just out of curiosity, does the school district use?    I mean, what if a particular child's grandfather was white?         Would he qualify as a white or non-white.              I mean, there must be some criterion.    There are many people of mixed blood.              It allows parents to say I'm white, no matter what?              Seems like a big loophole.             Well, it seems to me you're saying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. Can you think of any area of the law in which we say whatever it takes, so long as there's a real need, whatever it takes -- I mean, if we have a lot of crime out there and the only way to get rid of it is to use warrantless searches, you know, fudge on some of the protections of the Bill of Rights, whatever it takes, we've got to do it? Is there any area of the law that doesn't have some absolute restrictions?             But what about the Fourteenth?    I thought that was one of the absolute restrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people on the basis of their race.             You can pursue the objectives that your school board is pursuing, but at some point you come against an absolute, and aren't you just denying that?
05-9222 +++$+++            Why does it make any less sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow separate appeals to this Court from each of those?        And once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only from final judgment, but you can bring here on certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.           A fortiori, we have a lot more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our jurisdictional statute under certiorari. Why does it make any more sense for habeas purposes to insist that he await the final sentence before he gets review of the premise for that sentence, namely the conviction?           All right.           But you're saying he can't later bring any claim about the sentence?
05-9264 +++$+++            Mr. Marcus, it is a lot easier to do that with respect to the facts and circumstances of a particular crime than it is to do it generically -- you know -- picking out attempted burglary.     It is very hard to do that.          Why shouldn't we read this, this residual category to refer to the facts and circumstances of the particular crime of which the defendant has been convicted?             The language enables you to do that.     The term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury, physical injury to another. Why can't we not, not interpret that to mean generic crime, but rather the particular crime of which this defendant stands convicted?           That would be fine if burglary were the only thing that Congress said there, but it also said extortion.        And I think it absolutely fanciful to believe that extortion characteristically -- characteristically -- involves a risk of physical harm. I just don't think it does.           Yes, but is the criterion "characteristically," or is the criterion whatever minimal risk of harm there is in extortion?           Is the level of potential risk the level that exists in extortion?          Right?   That's what the otherwise refers you to.
05-983 +++$+++                 What's that section you just alluded to?     I'm blasting by it.                  Where is it, in the --                F --              21 A or -- -              And which is the statutory section again.              I thought you said 14.              Are you sure it's not 18(a)?              It's in 18(a) of mine, too. Maybe I have a different brief there.             What if -- what stands in the way of that analysis is the text, which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child. Not only doesn't that help you, it seems to me it hurts you.   It acknowledges that there are rights accorded to parents.             But then you were denying them, as I understood the argument.             What was the section you cited?             (e)(3)(E).             Legal fees.      The disbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support legal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure a free and appropriate public education for such child. What do you think that proves?
05-996 +++$+++             Was that Second Circuit's decision a decision that said the court didn't have the power because it had not been moved to take that action by the party who had the responsibility for raising the issue?   Was that the basis for the Second Circuit's decision?             Then -- then you haven't contradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.           Mr. Brunstad, are you going to address the mootness point?           Do you think the case is moot?            Did you make the jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy court?            How so?            I find that extraordinary.           This case, your case?          What does the trustee do? He's not really a trustee under 13, is he?          I mean, the property doesn't vest in him, you've told it.              It remains in the ownership of the debtor?          He's called a trustee, though?          Well that's really not his capacity.              It's called Chapter 13 day?           Does the government have any position on the mootness question here?
05-998 +++$+++             I would like to even sharpen Justice Breyer's hypothetical.             Let's assume that the indictment did set forth what the overt act was.   It did.   But there was no evidence of that overt act introduced before the grand jury.             What would the result of that be?            Then the trial occurs --            He's convicted.     And I think you're going -- your position is that conviction would stand.            That doesn't seem to me to make a lot of sense.          Well, I don't understand that.    You're saying it's a separate offense, but a lesser included offense is a separate offense.          It just happens to be embraced within some other offense.          What does that mean, if you're tried for illegal entry and the Government doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under supervision when you get in, the jury could not convict of attempt?          And that would be okay, just charge with attempt without setting forth the overt acts for the attempt?            Mr. Baggot, could I come back to your answer to my earlier question.             You said you could only be convicted of the lesser included offense if the lesser included offense is set forth explicitly in the indictment.             Are you sure of that?            Are you sure that's the law?              As I said in my previous question, every lesser included offense is itself a substantive offense.      That doesn't distinguish attempt from anything else.     And my understanding is if you're charged with a greater offense, the lesser can be a subject of conviction even though it's not explicitly set forth in the indictment.              And if that is the case here, then it seems to me he could have been convicted of attempt without ever having had set forth in the indictment the overt act that you demand.
06-1005 +++$+++                 So why are you urging us to create two problems, to drag along all of the problems that you object to with -- with interpreting proceeds to include simply covering your expenses?                   You acknowledge that the problems you point out would continue to exist if we accept your definition. On the other hand, I think you have to acknowledge that accepting your definition creates other problems of its own, such as the difficulty in every case of showing that an illegal operation made a profit, such as the difficulty of deciding what kind of criteria you use for determining what are the -- what are the ordinary and necessary expenses of a criminal enterprise. Why should we -- why should we choose to get the worst of both worlds?           And why isn't the proper way to attack the difficulty to focus in on what constitutes a transaction and what constitutes concealment -- something other than the "proceeds" definition?              Mr. Vare, you know, I'm -- I'm unwilling to decide the definition of transaction question in the present case because, frankly, I think that's a -- in itself, a very difficult question which we haven't had adequately argued.                For example, while I believe, as I've indicated earlier, that paying off the winners is -- is an essential part of a gambling operation, I don't believe that paying off runners necessarily is.   You can have a gambling operation without runners, can't you?            You can --              You can -- you can view that as something beyond the mere -- the mere gambling crime.   I don't -- I don't think you can view that paying off the winners is beyond the gambling crime, but I do think having a bunch of runners and paying off each of them is not necessarily part of gambling.              Exactly.             Not just proving that it's profitable; proving that the person laundering it knew that it was profits because that's part of the definition of the crime, that scienter.                  And how can you prove that the fellow knew that it was profits?                  He would very rarely know whether it was or wasn't.                  So he skips off scot-free free of the laundering crime.                 I mean what -- what's the total stage you look at?         Suppose it's profitable 1 month and not the next month, and the loss the second month more than undoes the profits of the first month. Can you still prosecute them for the profits in the first month?               One day they could pick then, they have one good day.             And they could --              Why does it have to be the ordinary expense of that?           I mean, let's assume the charge is murder, and I happen to use a hit man for the murder.    That's proven and whatnot. Why -- you mean, that isn't part of the murder conviction, simply because I could have done it without a hit man, I could have done it myself?                 You think paying the hit man would be part of the murder transaction?                 Uh-huh.                 No, I understand.             He wanted to kill his wife, right?
06-10119 +++$+++              As to life imprisonment or as to the death penalty?             Where is this?      I -- 364? Show me --             Right.              Well, we -- we have to go -- your -- this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry for any appellate court, even when we go into the allegations that the prosecution did make. Now you're saying we also have to imagine other reasons, which he didn't state were the reasons why he struck, but which might have been.               You really think that that's enough to --              It is not mine.               The rule is not that you can't -- so long as you have some black on the jury, you can strike the rest.               Any single person.
06-102 +++$+++               Well, that only proved that an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the ground relied upon by the district court, even if the ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid ground.   It's up to an appellate court -- - it's available to an appellate court, especially where the ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into jurisdiction and say there isn't any.                   I don't know, I don't know how that adds to your case.             Well, you found one appellate court that chose to do it that way.                        Frankly, if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground was valid.             Yes.               Well, why -- I mean, I assume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that judgment would assume that there was personal jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that into the mix.     Assuming we have personal jurisdiction, is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum?                   And if the court can say yes, that's the end of the game. I don't see what you have to gain here. Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction and dismisses for forum non conveniens?                   What, what -- what are you gambling for here?                I don't understand what's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to achieve?               Right, and the district court at best for you, at best, finds personal jurisdiction.     If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum non conveniens.     If it finds personal jurisdiction, it would say:   Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same call that I made before.          Dismissed for forum non conveniens.               Unless there's something at the end of the discovery.          Now, maybe what you hoped is that the Republic of China would not accede to the discovery and therefore, you would get a default judgment or something.       You know, I just -- I just don't see what's at the end of this game for you.              I guess we should ask the other side, but I think I know what their answer will be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction?   And what do you think?              Yes, I agree.              I agree.         So how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result.
06-1037 +++$+++                  Well, why does that matter? I mean, the exception in the statute is for -- for retirement, taking age into account for retirement, is narrowly crafted.     It says that they can make any decision about -- they can require the attainment of a minimum age as a condition of eligibility for normal or early retirement. Now, we have not read that to exclude adding an additional element to age, namely age plus years of service.    We don't say that that disables you from the -- from that exemption.         Why can't you add a third factor?    Age, years of service, and disability.              And --              Just say that again.        Just say the last thing again.         I didn't follow you.               Why?      I -- I think -- you mean in the future?               Under their belt.        I see.
06-1082 +++$+++               But you think they would accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?              It seems to me we've crossed that bridge with Atwater.              No.     It's designed to test whether you really mean unlawful under State law. Either you don't mean it, because something that violates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State law, and yet you would not apply your test.               So you could express your test differently, unlawful under State statutory law.              What about Cooper -- Cooper v California?              Mr. Goldstein, can I bring you back to Cooper v. California?              Which you say is a good case for you.    I don't see how you can say that.                  This was a case of a car impounded.                The State court had said that there was no authority to search the car, simply because it was impounded, and we said the question here is not whether the search was authorized by State law; the question is rather whether the search was a reasonable one under the Fourth Amendment. Just as a search authorized by State law may be an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a search not expressly authorized by State law be justified as a constitutional reasonable one.           And you think that helps your case?              Even though the State law did not authorize it.              They were assume ing, in that passage, that the State law did not authorize it, or otherwise the passage makes no sense.
06-11206 +++$+++                Say that again.           I didn't understand it.               But it's not common sense that the person who has been guilty of a crime so gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on the weekends would confront the policeman with violence when he comes.   This is not normally what you think of as a violent type who has -- who has been told to report weekends to the prison.             But did he get additional time, by the way, when -- when they finally brought him back?             So he just -- he just had to make up the weekends that he had lost?             Well, this guy doesn't sound to me like Jack the Ripper.                He really doesn't.               But they didn't use a gun.              The problem is you say if he had used a gun.      And he didn't use a gun.                 I mean, to come up with your statistics on the basis of something that didn't happen is not using statistics; it's using imagination.

06-11543 +++$+++                Ms. Kruger, what I don't understand about this statute as you're interpreting it is why you need any of it except the last phrase?                      Once you give the last phrase, "involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another," all of the rest of it is automatically included.   "Has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person of another" -- that obviously presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.                      Or is burglary, arson, extortion, the use of explosives?                      Congress could have saved itself a lot of trouble by simply erasing all the rest of the statute and simply saying any conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury or not.   That can't be what they meant.              Why -- why would Congress go through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest what other kind of crimes they need to include by this residual category of "any conduct" that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury?              The degree of risk -- the degree of risk, for example?              So if it doesn't come up to the degree of risk that any of those four would, it would not be included?              No.              Well, then what did it do? What's it do?              How?      How?     How does it limit the latter part?         Is it because they are all crimes that require mens rea, intent?                     So should we limit it by saying it has to be a -- a conduct that's intentional conduct that presents a serious risk?              But you say it does limit it.     So tell me how it limits it?              That's nice.        Benchmark of what?     Of intent, of degree of risk?              Okay.       So the degree of risk has to be pretty much similar to those four?               Comparable --             Oh, but it didn't mean that -- you said it didn't mean that because they could have said that and nothing else.           If that's what they meant, they could have eliminated everything else that they said.   They obviously meant to tie that to the preceding portions.    And when you tie it to the preceding portions, you come up with some limitations of the sort that Justice Breyer was suggesting.               She says not at all.   Your friend on the other side says that it's something like, what, two and a half percent for burglary and point something for the chances of hurting somebody if you're driving DUI?              You don't think this is just limited to intentional arson?                   You think negligent arson?     Wow.              Negligent extortion, negligent use of explosives?              I mean, it's in a list of things that are talking about, you know, intentional crimes that armed career criminals would be likely to do.              I don't think Congress had the slightest idea. (Laughter.)
06-116 +++$+++               What if, what if you have an ambiguous statute where it really is not clear whether it applies to pending cases or not?             What, what -- you say if it turns out after the fact that it does apply to pending cases, you are out of time, if you haven't immediately filed here while the case is still -- is still pending.              Well, you'd say Santos, then, is -- is -- is the Rubicon?                  Not the enactment of the statute, but Santos?              Yeah.       Your last argument, then, is irrelevant.     I mean if it's clear, it doesn't matter what they did before.              Which is not this case.                But it doesn't have to be 100 percent.     They could change what you call the tax valuation from 100 percent of the fair value to 150 percent.   There's really much less to this case than meets the eye.     I mean, Guam is going to be able to fiddle with this thing no matter how you come out.                 Well, whether it was their intent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say all property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair market value and we will then impose a 1 percent real estate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the 1.5 percent we had before?               I cannot imagine that if a territory of the United States goes belly up, that the United States is not going to foot the bill.                    I just can't imagine that.             Could you tell me whether the rate of tax is uniform throughout Guam?                The rate of real estate tax.    Is it an island-wide tax or is it local, county?             I don't know why you just didn't raise your assessed value from 30 percent to 100 percent and reduce the rate of tax accordingly.

(Laughter.)              You think it would be valid or don't think it wouldn't be valid?

06-1181 +++$+++               Mr. Kneedler, I think, I think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good answer to that.    I also thought it was a quid pro quo, but it's a very strange quid pro quo.                    I could understand the government saying, look, if you accept voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to choose between asking for reopening or voluntary departure.   But that's not the quid pro quo you're saying that the government is adopting.                   The quid pro quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the dice as to whether your reopening petition will be decided in time.     It isn't dead.              It's still there, but you just have to hope that it will be decided before you get deported.              I don't understand your answer.     You said you can or you can't from out of the country?               So why, if you want to have a petition for reopening, why don't you just file an appeal and then file a petition for reopening and the appeal will enable you to stay in the country until your -- your petition for reopening is --               You're appealing the immigration judge's decision.               The immigration judge's decision, you're appealing that to the BIA.               And that -- that enables you to stay in the country --               And at the same time you file a petition to reopen the -- the administrative law judge's --               Yes.

What it means by "prisoner of war" is the same thing that the Constitution means?                General Clement, if we had to either charge or release these people, what would they be charged with?        Waging war against the United States?   Is there a statute that prevents non-citizens from waging war against the United States and provides criminal penalties?
06-1204 +++$+++               Counsel, what does unfairness have to do with it?              I mean the whole doctrine of sovereign immunity rests upon unfairness. It says you can't sue the sovereign even if you have a valid claim.   And when we say we will apply the same doctrine as to foreign sovereigns, it means the same thing.   I'm just not terribly persuaded by the fact that it has unfair consequences.            The doctrine of sovereign immunity always has unfair consequences.                So, unless you're asking us to abandon the doctrine, the fairness argument does not persuade me.
06-1221 +++$+++               But you assert that the mere fact that it is pursuant to the same reduction in force is enough of a connection.                 What if even one of these three had existed?      Only one these three?                 One of these three other employees who complained about age discrimination. Would that have the same tendency to show it?                 You think one is enough?                 Yes.               No, I'm not talking about somebody up at the top.          I'm talking about somebody on the same level as the supervisor that you're concerned with.   One other supervisor in this company of 70,000 has -- is accused of having made age-discriminatory decisions.               Well, all of these are just accused.   We have -- none of this has been proven.               So --              Mr. Egan, what if I think that, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been an abuse of discretion not to exclude it?                  What if I think that? Then what happens with this case?             No, but I am worried about having five trials -- you know, one trial turning into six trials.    I mean those are the factors that I am concerned about.             Yes.              They may have just thought the game isn't worth the candle.                Just thought we've sunk so much money into this case by now and it's just not worth the risk.               And that's the problem that concerns me.   It is not the question of whether the trial is going to last for three weeks.                 It is a question at the prospect that the trial will last for three weeks and they will have to go out and find other people in their organization and depose them and bring them in to show them it is not the culture.                They just say it is not worth the candle.              Just settle the case and get out.   All of these things are relevant to how you rule on 403 it seems to me.                 It seems very strange to me that we -- there's been -- the case went to the jury without the evidence you wanted to get in.                   The jury found for the company.         Now if the -- if the trial court is going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we should then have the very same trial with a new jury? That doesn't seem proper.
06-1249 +++$+++               Excuse me.       Those -- those risks were set forth on the labeling approved by the FDA.     Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to include a warning as soon, as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard that the FDA has not considered.                   And that is not already addressed on the labeling.                   I mean to read it as -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered by the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out of it.                Well, you're just contradicting the label.           The fact is they could not have approved that label unless they made that determination. Now, if you're telling me the FDA acted irresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA.                But the labeling made it very clear that the preferred method of administering this medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that there were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push. Moreover, your client didn't follow the labeling or your client's physician didn't follow the labeling prescription for IV push, did he?              No.     No.      Wait, wait.   He administered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in excess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could safely be used for IV push.              Had no bearing.        Are you serious?                You established that there were new problems?      I mean, if there were new problems, then -- then they could have simply supplemented the labeling.   But did you establish that there were problems that had not been considered already by the FDA? I mean, the labeling says, you know, that this is dangerous to use -- use IV push.                  It made it very clear that it's dangerous.                It proposed a more restrictive label to the FDA, didn't it?                  And the FDA said, no, you use this label.               In other words, it's -- what you're saying was not its call.                    It was the call of the FDA.              What if it referred to new drug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you are saying manufacturers change it all the time as new drug risks become apparent?              What you mean is whether or not new drug risks become apparent, they have to change, right?             And -- and is entitled to amend the labeling automatically.              I envision a -- a scheme under which manufacturers who are worried about jury liability of -- of the magnitude that occurred in this case saying, gee, why should we take chances?           And every time there is a jury verdict on some -- on some other -- some other ground not -- not prohibited by the label, they just add that to the label; and they submit it to -- to the FDA and the -- and until -- unless and until the FDA conducts an investigation and disapproves that label, that labeling change occurs. How many -- how many -- you mentioned a number of -- of times that -- that label alterations are -- are proposed.     I mean, this is going to be a massive operation for the FDA.              It would not promote public safety if you believe that the name of this game is balancing benefits and costs.              And if you are simply eliminating certain drugs which people who -- who have real desperate need for could -- could be benefited by, you're not benefiting the public.              And that applies even if it's approved by the FDA?              You're saying FDA approval doesn't -- doesn't give you any protection at all?              But -- but -- but the marketing may be a misbranding?             Well then, gee, then all of the qualifications you were making earlier about whether it's new information or a new assessment, that's irrelevant.             You're saying whenever it's unsafe, whatever the FDA has approved, you have a lawsuit.             There -- there was nothing about new information in what you just said.              You said it's misbranded if it's not safe, new information or not.             Is that -- is that -- is that your position?             If that's a fair statement then you have to retract your -- your earlier assertion that whenever it's not safe it's misbranded.              I mean --             -- which is it?   Whenever it's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just responded to Justice Souter?               But the label doesn't.     I mean, the label ask discusses the high risk from IV push and sets forth particular cautions for that -- for that specific means of administration.
06-1286 +++$+++                  Why do you think that the only instances where the expense would not have occurred are those instances where it could not have occurred? That doesn't strike me as self-evident. I mean, I understand why you do it, so that can you have a nice clear line, which I am all for.                       But the line given by your colleague is just as clear.                       I don't know why I should accept yours when -- I mean, "would" just does not mean "could."                       I mean, would have, could have, should have, it's -- they're different words.             Give me a context where -- where -- other than this statute, where in common parlance people use "would" to mean "could."             No, I don't think it would mean that.             Anything that could not be done of course would not be done.                But that doesn't mean that the -- that the two words mean the same thing.             It's true that one is included within the other, but they don't mean the same thing.             What could not happen would not happen, of course.       But it doesn't mean that -- the two concepts are not the same.              Well, I have the same problem.    You know, I -- it seems to me that it is entirely reasonable to say only a trustee can seek investment advice concerning what he should do to fulfill his responsibilities under the trust.                 Only a trustee can do that.       A private individual might seek investment advice as to how he could maximize the income or -- or the growth of the funds that he has, but only -- only a trustee seeks advice as to how he can fulfill his responsibilities under the trust.                 And you could say that's distinctive.              No individual would do that because he's not a trustee.             It may -- it may well be the same advice, but in -- but in one case it is -- it is advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique kind of advice.    In -- in substance, it may turn out to be the same; but it's not the same advice you're giving to a private individual.          You're saying here's the trust instrument and here are the objects to be achieved by the trust instrument and this is the -- the advice that will best do that.      That doesn't happen with an individual.               Can you really spice up advice that way?    You ask the advisor, say, which -- what percentage of your advice was the advice that went to maximizing total return and what percentage went to this other thing?    I mean, gee, I don't want to get courts into trying to figure that out, or private individuals or financial advisors in trying to figure that out.   That's just a crazy way to run a tax system, it seems to me.               But that's not all advice. That's just some of the advice, right?               Now, what about the rest of it?   How do you slice up, you know -- now, investment advisor, tell me what percentage of your advice went to the total return and what percentage went to other things.   I don't think the investment advisor is going to be able to tell you.              And whatever line you -- you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line. I mean people aren't stupid. (Laughter.)                I think "would not have occurred" is pretty good --                -- actually.               The cost of the advice? What percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you think the investment advice consists of?                 I mean, it seems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at least if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it. It seems to me his major expense must be getting financial advice, isn't that right?               Well, imagine something else.   Guess.   What other, what other expense could even approximate that?               And then my follow-up is, is there any -- I don't care about legislative history but some of my colleagues do.              Is there any -- is there any indication that Congress thought it was, it was whacking trusts with this immense new tax with respect to their major expenditure?              I expect it must be their major expenditure.                The dog didn't bark.                Well, you know a trust is sort of like a business.           And deductions that an individual could not take if he were not in a business are perfectly okay for a business.                   And I don't know why trusts wouldn't be treated the same way.                   A trust has to get investment advice.         True?        When it's -- when it's an individual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction, but a trust is different. And unless Congress is clearer than this statute, I -- it seems to me that no individual would get trust investment advice.              Only a trust can get trust investment advice.              But the individual who wanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee has to maximize income for some of the life beneficiaries or something, an individual could seek that same advice if he wanted that particular result from the investment, couldn't he?              Oh, I didn't understand it to be that.     I thought it was going to be, you know, the advisor had to figure out we need so much for the, for the remainder man and so much for the life beneficiaries and so forth.     You don't think that would be enough?
06-1287 +++$+++                 It seems to be what it says though, isn't it?                 What's the language? What's the crucial language?                 No, it doesn't require -- what it say the district court is supposed to find?                 It's supposed to find the true market value of the railroads.                       It doesn't seem to me fuzzy language.      District court is to find true market value.                 It's a very strange way of saying the district judge is to -- is to ask whether the State has used one of a number of reasonable methods of determining the market value.               To say, go find the true market value is a very strange way of saying that, and that's what you, that's what you're saying it means.               I was expecting you to say, that what is truth? (Laughter.)             The trouble is you can't find a -- it is a line, but it's not a line you can derive from true market value.              I mean, you can do it, but what in the statute suggests that that's what you should do?             No, I don't think they're not going to get that from this Court, any more than they could get it from the Court of Appeals.             All the Court of Appeals can say, it seems to me, is that the methodology that the district court used was not clearly erroneous. I think another district court in a later year could probably use a different methodology, which would again be affirmed by the Court of Appeals because it was not clearly erroneous.             We're not -- I don't think either the Court of Appeals or this Court is placing any stamp on a particular methodology.             Maybe they did, but they're not going to get it here. (Laughter.)              This State appraiser as I understand it had never done an appraisal before of -- of this magnitude, right?              I'm looking for the footnote, but I -- I was, I was impressed by what seemed to me the -- the vast difference in -- in qualifications and experience of the -- of the State appraiser and of the expert who was brought in by the railroads at the trial.   And it seemed to me quite absurd to say we have to defer to -- to this novice in the field, and -- and not look at the -- at the testimony of -- of someone who has done a lot of it before.              Did you have a response -- did you have a response to that footnote?                I didn't --              I'm sorry.       I must have skipped that.              A little footnote battle here, right?              Of yours?              And that's what you have here.   I've looked -- I've looked at your footnote and I see that indeed Mr. Dickerson did have over 30 years experience including well over a thousand valuations -- performed under the unit rule; performed under one method of evaluation, right?              But the whole issue here is that that method of valuation, however expert he is at it, is not proper here.        It doesn't work.         That there are other ones that should have been brought to bear.                 Was one of the ones, yes; but that's not the only one.              That's the only one he is an expert in.                 And it's different methodologies under the unit rule.                   He has used -- he has used different methodologies under --                Mr. Calvert, can you tell me how this thing works, or how it may work in the future? Does the State just whip up a number and lay it on the railroad, or -- or, in fact, is there some discussion each year between the railroad's experts and the -- and the State's experts as to what the right number should be?              Okay.       So there is some give-and-take discussion before the State comes down firmly and says:     Cough up the money?              Okay.
06-1321 +++$+++                  I though we are talking here a prohibition against taking retaliatory action. Isn't that a prohibition?                 Yes.                 Mr. Garre, are we going to have to decide the Title VII question in this case?               We don't even have the materials in front of us.              They haven't been put in the appendix to the briefs.                And in order to decide this case, we're going to have to decide a Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?
06-1322 +++$+++                 Is this after the real charge was filed or what everybody concedes --                The charge form.             But suit was pending at that time. (Laughter.)             That's pretty risky.             Answer my question.          Was suit already filed at that point?             Yes.                Wait.       I'm sorry.   247 during that whole period?                That's the only number of mistakes they have made; is that what you're saying?                I'm astounded if that's the only number of mistakes they made, from 19 --                Oh, with respect to FedEx.                Oh.               What's -- what's wrong with this?   Why don't I -- I mean, I do believe that the thing either is a charge or isn't a charge before the EEOC decides whether it's going to give notice or not. It either is or isn't. Now, what about this:                It is a charge if it reasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say "manifest intent," that's okay, too. Now, if you signed a document which -- which says that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is to discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or ought to know, that this is not a charge. And we can't run the system for people who are either illiterate or don't even have friends who are literate.   We can't run a system that way.                So I look at this, and I say this is not a charge.              Now, if the EEOC chooses to give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and there is -- there is no harm done.                 You can have the counseling, and so forth. But when you come in with something that doesn't look like a charge, it seems to me if there is no notice given and you get into the situation that is here where the company has been deprived of the conciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to preserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault should lie on your client, because she filed something that any reasonable person should know is not a charge.              Whatever it was, this thing says it's a precharge document.               Why do you think -- why do you think they must have lost it?                  Why did you think they must have lost it:          Because she hadn't been given a number?             Even if they treat it as a charge, they don't docket it?             I really think the problem here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else.             It does, indeed, have this form which says -- which says that its purpose -- information provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of the facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah. All of that, however, is contained as part of the Privacy Act statement.             And if the filer is not interested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't even read the Privacy Act.              Well, what kind of an agency is this? (Laughter.)             Where does that appear? Where does that appear?             In its very definition of a "charge," it says a charge shall be in writing and shall name the prospective respondent and shall generally -- shall generally allege the discriminatory acts.                   That's what it must contain.              It doesn't say that anything that contains that is a charge.              I could write out something that contains all three of those things.                   Would that be a charge?              All right.       Let's try something else.              Well, then, all intake questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain that.   I mean that definition is simply inconsistent with the -- with the agency's assertion that it has something called an intake questionnaire which does not constitute a charge unless -- I don't know -- unless there's manifest whatever it is. That's inconsistent because all of those intake questionnaires contain all of that information --              -- set forth in 26.3.                 Mr. Heytens, let me tell you going in that my -- my main concern in this case, however the decision comes out, is to do something that will require the EEOC to get its act in order, because this is nonsense:     These regulations that are contradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but it's okay because it's a charge anyway. This whole situation can be traceable back to the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme has to be revised.              Excuse me.              That's within 10 days of the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to be proven.    I mean what is the charge?              If -- if the prefiling, the intake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem.               Can you not make that not a charge by saying in bold letters on the top:            This is not a charge.   If you want a charge, ask for Form 5?               Why do the courts have to struggle with this when the agency could put in bold letters at the top:     This is a charge or this is not a charge? Why do Federal district judges have to inquire into manifest intent from now until doomsday?              Where is that in CFR?              Oh, okay.                 Mr. Heytens, what's your solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has happened here?    How do you think that should play out?                 That's right.
06-134 +++$+++               Mr. Cardozo, before you go any further, I had been under the impression from your brief that you're not trying to enforce anything against, against India or against the mission.                      You just said you wanted a declaratory judgment that the lien is a valid lien.     But, but here it is in your complaint you're asking for foreclosure.                Which, which is it?              You just asked for it to scare them?     Was that it?               Well, but they'll say as was their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the commercial act exception covers that.              Why didn't you just say -- you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of stuff easements, which, which the other side says is undoubtedly a property interest.              So they could say that, you know, if you're held liable the court can give you an easement over the property of, of the defendant worth so much money.     And that would undoubtedly be enforceable.               Do you know any States that don't?   Isn't it fairly standard?                For --               Yeah.                The -- the -- the European, the European treaty looks at it from the other side, you're saying.    It looks at it from the foreign sovereign side.                Would the obligations arising out of the property in the European Convention include the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?              This says what explicitly?             Can I ask you what, what do you get out of this case?           You've withdrawn your claim for judgment of foreclosure.             What are you going to get out of it?    Declaratory judgment that they owe the taxes?   I'm not sure they have ever contested that they don't owe taxes.             Yeah, but --             Why do you believe him about that?              Well, wait a minute.      But the -- the embassy has rights in it when the case is brought, even before the final judgment.               So you know, let's give the devil his due.            It would be a case in which rights in immovable property are in issue.              You want to look at it from the embassy side too so --              Well, that's your big defense.   To do that they would have to do it for everybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as well as for the embassy, right?              What do you do with traffic tickets?    They've built up.           You know, there's $100,000 owing in traffic tickets by some embassy.                   How do you get a judgment that that is owing?              So you can't use even the foreign aid gimmick to --
06-1413 +++$+++                You'd not wager, however, right?               You're taxing Mead, not Nexis/Lexis?               So what relevance is it that Nexis/Lexis has business in Illinois?               I mean that's fine if that's who you're taxing.               I might say that I don't follow that.   It seems to me what you can establish from the fact that it did a lot of business in Illinois is that can you tax it and -- but I don't see how.              Do you have any case like that where your ability to tax a surviving corporation has to do with, not whether the surviving corporation itself has sufficient contacts with the State, but whether some other corporation that has disappeared now but that merged into it had sufficient -- it seems to me you have to establish connection with the taxpayer.                    Not -- not with somebody from whom the taxpayer made some money.              That's fine.              But that isn't established by the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there. Ultimately you have to come down to connecting it to Mead, either by your unitary business doctrine or by this functional doctrine that you're relying on.             Can you tax me on stock -- on stock that I own on companies that do business in Illinois?             Do you know any State that tries to do it.              That's extraordinary.          I don't know of any tax that a State could possibly impose, that no State has imposed. (Laughter.)
06-1431 +++$+++               That's a good argument to Congress.    Congress should enact a retaliatory provision.    But the statute says what it says, and what it says is that there has to be discrimination on the basis of race.    And firing somebody for -- in retaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on the basis of race.      Indeed, the person making the complaint may not have been the person who was racially discriminated against.         You would acknowledge that you couldn't fire -- if retaliations claims lie, you couldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this employer has been discriminating against blacks. Wouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action for being fired?              On your theory, but that has nothing to do with the text of the statute, which requires discrimination on the basis of race.                I agree with you entirely that it would make sense to provide a cause of action for retaliation, but we don't write statutes.     We read them.        And there's nothing in this statute that says that.              Well, you can say that, but it doesn't make any sense.             It didn't make any sense then, either. (Laughter.)              I guess those court of appeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a retaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as to whether there was any post-contract claim?                     Right?   I mean, they were wrong about that.                  Patterson, in effect, said you're wrong.             So if they were wrong about whether there's a post-contract claim, why wouldn't they be wrong about whether there's a retaliation claim?             I don't know why we should give deference to them on the one point when they've been proven wrong on the other one.              It's a little more complicated than that.      We inferred that cause of action in the bad old days, when we were inferring causes of action all over the place. Now, the position the Government takes here is that we should infer this new cause of action to assist the one that's already on the books.                   Is the Government going to be consistent in this position?                      And you want us to in the future go back to our prior practice of readily inferring causes of action that are not set forth in the -- in the text of this statute? Is the Government willing to live with that?              Patterson was still the bad old days.     When do you think the bad old days ended? (Laughter.)              Oh, I'm sorry.          I was thinking of Sullivan.
06-1456 +++$+++               He puts it in his shoe, okay.     Because it's a lot, he puts it in his shoe.              That would be enough, wouldn't it?             And you're basically confronting face-on the dissent here, which drew a distinction between transporting to conceal and concealing to transport.          And all you have here is concealing to transport, and the question is whether that violates the statute. I agree with Justice Breyer that if this is a statute directed at concealing to transport, it's a funny name for it to think that it's a money laundering statute.                Everybody knows he's a drug dealer, back in Juarez or wherever he lives in Mexico.                He's famous in town.    He's a well respected man because he's a big drug dealer. And he has just arranged get the money delivered to him so that he can spend it.         What -- what's concealing there?             It won't be disguised.              Just to be clear, you affirmatively say that concealing to transport is enough, right?              There's no principle that all criminal statutes have to cover every -- every bad act.     Maybe Congress has left a gap.                   I'm willing to entertain the possibility that this individual, obviously doing something very bad, doesn't -- falls between the two stools.          He is neither guilty under the taking currency out of the country statute because he didn't know of the existence of the statute, and he's not guilty under one because he was not transporting to conceal but was concealing to transport.                      And so there's a gap.    The Justice Department can certainly get that gap filled readily enough.            I don't know why we should torture either one of the statutes to close it.              If you're trying to prevent the money --              What if --- if that's what they're concerned about, taking the money out of the country, why do they have the concealment requirement? They could have just said, you know, if you take dirty money out of the country you're guilty.               They didn't say that.   They have a concealment -- I can't understand why, if the money is hidden during the transportation, it's any worse than when the money is not hidden during the transportation.   It isn't -- it isn't the hiding during the transportation they're concerned about.             The statute doesn't make any sense that way.
06-1457 +++$+++              I mean you're suggesting they should be punished for that?                 I don't understand what -- what follows?       I mean --              Didn't your clients know that the market was chaotic at the time they entered into this long-term contract?             I mean does this come as a surprise that after the fact, now that you're paying more than the market price is, you want to kick over a long-term contract you entered into? What has changed?             Did you not know that the market was chaotic?     Wasn't that the very reason you entered into the long-term contract.                 In fact, you did very well under these contracts.         Initially, you were even reselling some of the energy that you got.                       You got it at a price so much below what was then the market that you made a profit by reselling it. But now that things have changed, you don't like the long-term contract.                Mr. Wright, I really don't understand why you would -- why you say, you know, if -- if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know, an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly okay.   But if it's due to manipulation, it's bad.             I can understand if you added manipulation by one of the parties, by the sellers, that I could understand. But so long as it's a factor extrinsic to the parties to the contract, what difference does it make to the buyer whether the flukishness of the market is caused by the weather or by manipulation by somebody other than the seller? In other words, I think it's not enough to show manipulation.      That's what's going on in the market.   And you're trying to save yourself from it.              So long as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see how you have a -- I don't know -- an equitable case.             Just and reasonable when?             On the day they were agreed to.             They were just and reasonable --              If you are relying on the narrowest ground that Justice Souter mentioned, namely, manipulation by the seller, wasn't it incumbent on you to demonstrate that there was manipulation by the seller?     Has that been -- has that been established?              Because of manipulation by somebody.              Okay.
06-1463 +++$+++               Did you take a position below?     Your friend says that this is brand new up here.             Why would you want this to happen?    Why -- who would imagine such a system in which you bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent the matter from being resolved immediately with an arbitrator.    I don't know how long does it take for the Labor Commissioner?      I don't know.             Eight months.       But then when he's done --             She.      No matter what happens, you go back to the arbitrator.                  Who in his right mind would set up such a system?             This person is not a talent agent.             Judgment involved would have been binding --             -- on the third parties. You don't -- and you assert that the judgment here wouldn't be binding at all.             It's just because the Labor Commissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this -- your opponent says she's not at all --             Well, I imagine that's highly debatable. It's a different case where you say you have to wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as to many of the people in the case.              No.     His hypothetical was that the court decision would just be advisory and the arbitrator could ignore it.              Just get, you know, a knowledgeable person's input.              This contract said the same thing.    This contract will be governed by California law.              Would it suck up this provision that says you have to go to the Superior Court?              No.     I don't think so either.               Excuse me.       You say -- I thought you said it doesn't become binding.                 That it is just advice to the arbitrator.              Once you -- once you get the remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding.               Right.              But --              Well, I don't understand -- so you incorporate California law.                  I interpret that to mean substantive law of California. You say also incorporates -- and this is what I find peculiar.       California law gives you a procedural right to go to the labor commission.                 But it also gives you a procedural right to go to superior court.    And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses your using the superior court. Why doesn't it foreclose your using the labor commissioner?      I don't understand how you slice the bologna that thin.        To me, if it excludes California procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and the superior court.               Let me -- I want to understand that answer.          California law includes the Superior Court as much as it includes the labor commissioner.              So the California Supreme Court would construct a system in which you get the advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner.           One of the parties thinks that this expert's advice is ridiculous, just absolutely wrong. Now, California law generally considers the Superior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner, which is why you get de novo review before the Superior Court.              No?              It is stupider than the Labor Commissioner. (Laughter.)              All right.       I will amend it.   The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter than the Labor Commissioner, okay?                 And yet, one of the parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the way the California constitution envisions, by the ex officio smarter Superior Court.              And that is the scheme that the California Supreme Court is going to embed in California law?             The latter is disputed. The latter is vigorously disputed.
06-1498 +++$+++              I assume that if this drug were still on the market, you could bring forward the information that you have alluded to about the withholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the FDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide whether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the drug was necessary. In this case, the drug has already been withdrawn.   So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced incentive to go into these questions.                   I guess they still would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were really a bad actor.     They could impose some sanctions, couldn't they, even though the drug was already withdrawn?              Do you think we could have two different rules:     One for drugs that are still out there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn? Because I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you know, to go back over past mistakes.                   The drug now having been withdrawn, it doesn't matter. But if the drug was still out there, it seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much less sympathetic to what you're trying to do.                   You could trust the FDA to do the job.              No, but once it sanctions the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA. The FDA would have said:                    You didn't give us information that was necessary; and had we known this, we wouldn't have gone ahead.              What's the Sixth Circuit case?     It must have involved this, no?              I see.           What is your position on severability?            Why shouldn't we -- you know, we usually accept the circuit court's determination as to what the State law is.            Michigan is in the Sixth Circuit.     And I think it's overwhelmingly likely that the Second Circuit would defer to the Sixth Circuit's view.     Don't you think?

The court below required him to show an intent to distribute capital.                 But that was -- we're just not on the same page here.            That's not what the -- the decision you're defending said. The decision you're defending did not say that it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it was with respect to stock.            They said it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it was intended to be a return of capital.                 And that's just a wholly different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand for them to apply the proper test.              I doubt that.    Then -- then, you would say, when it is not a criminal prosecution for failure to pay taxes, so long as somebody, when they take the money, intended it to be a return of dividends, it does not become a return of capital.   Are you sure you're willing to live with that intent requirement?              At the time -- is it important for the tax treatment that at the time of the distribution it be intended to be either a return of capital or dividends?      Does that make the difference as to whether you're going to be able to tax it or not?              Well, I'm not -- we are not talking about distribution.              We are talking about the intent that it be a return of capital or not.              Either one.             It could be anything at all.   So in other words, there is no preliminary requirement that you intend that it be a return of capital.   Right.   So if the Court of Appeals said that here, it was wrong.              He wants a chance to argue that.   He was not given a chance to argue that.              He said -- and it seems to me that this is enough to put you on notice -- "Boulware will present further evidence that all of the alleged unreported income was either a loan or advance or was used by Boulware for corporate purposes or for the benefit of HIE."              Now, "for corporate purposes" would include either a return of capital or a dividend, payment out to shareholders.               Surely he is entitled to try to prove that.      And I'm still hung up on your assertion that he made no proffer on it below. Here's another portion of the joint appendix.   The expert, his expert, he says, will further explain that if Boulware used -- this is on page 97, bottom of 97:   "If Boulware used the moneys for corporate purposes, the moneys were not income to Boulware.   Alternatively, the expert will explain that if the moneys were not loans or advances or if Boulware did not use the moneys for corporate purposes, then as the controlling shareholder, the moneys could be deemed a constructive dividend or a return of capital to Boulware, which may or may not be income depending on whether or not HIE had earnings." That seems to me presenting the claim that he asserts he should have been given an opportunity to present.
06-157 +++$+++               Let me give you something more measurable.     It is easy to tell from time sheets and other things how much money is expended on Air Force One and on security for the President when he goes to address a religious organization, okay.                   And he urges the importance of religion in American life and so forth.   The whole trip is about religion.                 That's measurable.    Would a taxpayer have standing to --              Well, I don't understand. The money -- say it again?              You mean Congress has to, has to say that --               Well, what about Bowen? The money wasn't central to the violation there.               It was, you know, a pregnancy program and the executive added to it certain, certain restrictions that were challenged as being religiously based.               And we allowed an as-applied challenge.               But this is a specific grant.   There is money allocated to the White House which goes -- you can identify it in the budget, and some of it goes to Air Force One.                  Some of it goes to the payment of the security guards.              It wasn't in Bowen either.              I really don't think -- there's an identified sum of money that goes to pay the costs of Air Force One, too, to buy the gas and everything else.     There's an identified sum of money that goes into the pockets of the security guards who protect the President.         I mean, it really doesn't make any sense.             Or the contract hiring the security guards who protect the President, right? They're employed.    That's an employment contract.             And they're protecting him for a religious purpose.          He's going to this --             This is money that is expended in order to enable the President to do something for a religious purpose.                  It wouldn't be expended but for the fact that he chose to make this religious trip.               It wasn't, it wasn't the center in Bowen either.         The center in Bowen was programs for -- to combat pregnancy.                     And some of the organizations that were getting the money were placing conditions on it.    It wasn't central to the program.                     It was something added that the challenger said shouldn't have been added.               I see.           It would only came within your theory if there was one Secret Service agent who was assigned to religious trips of the President? Then his entire salary could be challenged.                  But if it's just some of the salary of a Secret Service agent who protects the President for all sorts of trips, that can't be challenged?                And that makes a lot of sense?             But in response to Justice Ginsburg's point, you could have said the same thing about the expenditure in Bowen.                    That money would have been spent anyway.              It happened to have been spent badly, but it would have been spent anyway.              That was her point, that it would have been spent differently.                 If the President hadn't gone to this religious event, he would have gone somewhere else and the money would have been spent differently.   But that didn't make the difference in Bowen.   Why should it make the difference here?              The fact is it was spent for a bad purpose, and that's the essential grievance of the plaintiff, it seems to me.                You really want to condemn the Federal courts to deciding case by case at the instance of all these people who feel passionately about this, case by case whether the expenditure was incidental or not.      It doesn't seem to me an intelligent expenditure of any sensible person's time.              What about 10?              I was about to ask, 20.              We'll litigate it.      We'll figure out a number eventually, I'm sure.                But the problem here is the claim, the gravamen here is the Government is doing stuff with money that's been taxed from me that it shouldn't do.   I fail to see how it makes any difference to the people who care so passionately about this, as Justice Breyer suggests, whether it's just an incidental expenditure or whether it's part of a targeted program. We don't do that in any other area of constitutional law.       If someone has been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure, we don't say well, you know, it was just incidental.              Yeah, we know you feel badly about it, but this was just an incidental search and seizure, and you don't have standing. It doesn't make any sense, given the gravamen that you're directing this law against, to establish such a standard.             And you also acknowledge we're not here to try to make sense.             Okay?       But not for any --             Why would there be standing?              How does that confer standing?   How does that confer standing?              Right.           Right.              Standing by Joe Doaks, not from somebody who's starting a Jewish prayer breakfast and says, you know, what could be worse than not buying bagels for a Jewish prayer breakfast. (Laughter.) With him I could understand, he has standing.   But I'm just talking about one of these many people who feel passionately about this just in general. You walk in and say he can't do this because I'm a taxpayer, and you say I'm sorry, being a taxpayer is not enough, we don't care how passionately you feel about it --             Well, it's not the same money used.    It's not the same property.             It goes into some pot of fungible money and it's other money used.                 So instead of using other money, you use land.                Does that make a difference?
06-1595 +++$+++               It would?          Why?   It doesn't seem so to me.     I mean, it either was or wasn't.                   You're making the argument, essentially, that "oppose" has two quite different meanings.            You can ask somebody, you know, do you oppose the war in Iraq?                      And all you're asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq.                         Do you think it is good or bad? But "oppose" is also used in a quite different sense.     He -- you say somebody opposed the war in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against it and so forth. And your assertion is that in this legislation, it has the latter meaning.                    It just doesn't ask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is good or bad.   It asks whether you were actively -- actively opposing it. Now, once you adopt that position, I don't see how the fact that you -- that something that was not active opposition can be converted into active opposition by something that occurred later. I mean, if you want to abandon your other argument, that's fine with me, but -- (Laughter.)             Would that uncomfortable? Say it doesn't.   I mean, I -- I don't care if you're uncomfortable with it.       Does it or doesn't it?             Then I don't understand your case.             It isn't just a specific -- again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a matter of the specific practice. Your point is it is not asking your opinion. It is asking whether you are actively trying to eliminate it. I think even if -- if you were asked your opinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you know, what this supervisor did?               And -- and you said yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not opposition.             And I don't see how that is changed at all when you put it in the context of a specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in the context of harassment in general. You -- you -- if you're hiding behind the -- the defenses you've built up, it seems to me those defenses require something more than an expression of your opinion of whether it's good or bad. Your opinion is whether it's good or bad is not opposition.              Well, I suppose your point would be it doesn't matter what the reason was that she didn't report it.    In order to recover here she has to have taken a public stand; and whatever the reason why she didn't, the fact is that she didn't. Why do you get into, you know, the reason that she didn't?              And -- and I suppose that you -- you would require the -- the opposition to be somehow a public -- a public expression of opposition. No?              I mean, if one political candidate says that the other one opposed the war in Iraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's a lie?    I'm sorry, that the charge would be held to be correct if, in fact, the other candidate had never said anything about the war in Iraq, although deep in his heart he thought it was probably a bad idea. Would you say that he opposed the war in Iraq?    I don't think so.              The implication is --              The implication is that he came out with some public position opposing it, and that's your position as to the meaning of --                Why couldn't he -- I'm sorry, Chief Justice.              You can't be fired after that, or the employer can't fire her without opening himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision. And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost money.   So why -- maybe an employer would rather say, you know, I'd rather roll the dice and -- and not conduct an investigation and insulate all of my hostile employees from -- from employment actions.               Do you get your litigation fees if you win?   If the plaintiff here loses, does she pay all the attorneys' fees that this employer has incurred on this litigation?               So even when you win you lose.              Isn't it true that financially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff because she has an attorney who is taking it on a contingent basis?     Now, you could say it's not cost-free to the lawyer; but even that's not always true because if the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be doing this, you know, whatever the odds are.
06-1646 +++$+++                It's not a more serious offense when she does it the second time; it's just a more culpable offender.             The government is correct, though, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being punished for the crime, not for his recidivism.             So you -- you can say that the punishment for that defined crime is 10 years when, when the person who committed the act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished for is the same crime.               I think we have applied the rule of lenity to sentencing in the past, haven't we?
06-1666 +++$+++                  Mr. Margulies, the prologue to the Constitution does say "to preserve the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."                  There is something to the notion, isn't there, that the Constitution provides constitutional rights, including the right to the writ of habeas corpus, to Americans or to anyone who is in America; but to say that the whole world has rights under the Constitution is extravagant.               Mr. Margulies, could I ask a few questions about the Multinational Force involved here?   Do you acknowledge that in theory, at least, the United States in its capacity here is subject to the control of the United Nations?               You do not?               Who says?          I mean, a transfer is one thing and saying you're free to go and the Iraqi government picks him up is something else. Why -- why do you equate the two?              But -- of course it can.              It can, but --              Well, why do you say it has nothing to do with the war, then?                 They are holding them as security detainees.        Aren't they -- aren't they worried that if they just let them go, they'll go right back to killing Americans and Iraqis?              I'm not arguing that.        I'm just questioning your statement that it's irrelevant that this is occurring in a war zone.                    It is not at all irrelevant. One of the -- the reason they're being detained is precisely because this is a war zone.
06-1717 +++$+++               Do you know of any other case where we used -- I mean it just gets worse and worse.   Do you know any other case where we've used the legislative history of a vetoed bill to determine the meaning of a later bill that was not vetoed?              Good.       What is it?              When was that?              Yes.              Never mind.      Don't take -- don't waste your time.               When you have a -- you can submit it a letter.      I've looked in your brief, I can't find this Jean case that you mentioned on use of veto. I have a certain morbid interest in it. (Laughter.)

This is all just a Chicken Little kind of a --                 Additional requirements are not necessarily conflicting requirements.                 You can comply with --                 It is clear that Congress didn't want additional requirements.             It was also a different Congress.              How much -- how many years later?              Why did we expect them to come out with the same --
06-219 +++$+++               Mr. Tribe, can I get something straight?      Is it indeed correct that what the government was seeking here was an exchange of easements, that the government was going to give one and your client would give the other?              With the predecessor in interest of your client.              Did what the government gave to your predecessor of interest, did that easement continue?   The government has just said that it expired.             That's how I understood it.                I don't care whether it was canceled, but I must say, if they were just seeking a fair exchange of reciprocal easements, which landowners do all the time --                And the system of lands out there can't work without it.                I wouldn't see anything terribly wrong about the BLM people say okay, he wants to play hardball, he wants to play by the book, we'll play by the book.     What would be wrong with --                See, I wouldn't feel bad about that if they said --                -- by God, every time his cows trespass, we're going to get him.                    Every time his hunting expeditions go on public land, we're going to get him.   That would seem reasonable to me.                   So it really is crucial to my view of the case that the government was not seeking a new exchange, it was seeking --              -- for him to cough up --             And then if you would have succeeded, you would have been compensated.               Mr. Tribe, I'll tell what you troubles me about this case.                 There are overzealous government agents.      There always have been and I am sure that, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is correct, I'm sure it is not the first time this has happened.    Government agents sometimes get overzealous. But why should there be this extraordinary remedy when the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire to get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked on this guy because they didn't like the way he combed his hair or for any other reason and had done the same things you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?              No, no.          If they were trying to get some other property for it or, or, or money for it, it didn't turn --              The whole spectrum of possible Government misbehavior, selective enforcement, the whole spectrum, the only, the only times we're going to allow a cause of action under Bivens or under, under not 1983 -- yes -- the only times we're going to do that is when there is a demand for property?
06-278 +++$+++              Well, but the school has -- the school has a program, an anti -drug program that shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers to preach against drug use and you're saying that -- never mind unfurling a banner.              You're saying that it has to let students contradict this message it's trying to teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that says "Smoke Pot, It's Fun."              Does the school have to do that?              But the school, even though it is trying to teach one point of view, can allow students to come in and undermine that point of view, assuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of view?   It can allow students to come in and undermine what it's trying to teach?              And that is not disruption in your view?                Nonviolent crimes are okay, it's only violent crimes that you can't, you can not promote, right?    Right?                "Extortion Is Profitable," that's okay?                This is a very, very, with all respect, ridiculous line.              I mean, I can understand you're saying you cannot promote things that are unlawful, but to say, oh, it's only violent, where do you get that line from, only violent unlawful acts?             Well, you can say that, but the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on it.   I mean, it stood the test of time in the sense that it hasn't been overruled, but --             I think we're using disruption in two different senses here and we should probably separate the two.           One sense is disrupting the class so that whatever is being taught can't be taught. But you're also using it in the sense of undermining a general message that the school is trying to get across: Obey the law, don't use drugs, whatever.                 Maybe we should have a different word for -- the first is disruption.    Disruption is a, is a funny word for the second.   Let's called it undermining instead. Now, you think both of them, however, are bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the speech?             So you think undermining is perfectly okay?    You would never consider undermining to be disruption and therefore bad?             Okay, but only that.             Right after a class on drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say: This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use them all the time, I urge all of you.                    That's perfectly okay?   That's not undermining?             That's not disruption?              A school isn't an open forum.    A school isn't there for everybody to teach the students whatever he wants.             It's there for the teachers to instruct.   And you're turning it into an open forum. If the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else has to be able to address that issue.               That's not my vision of what a school is.             I had to watch -- not even watch the parade, no requirement they watch the parade? They were released in order to watch the parade.             The intent, it was the direction.             It was not only the intent, it was the direction.              Go ahead.                As it is to us, right? (Laughter.)                He wasn't playing hooky. He showed up late, that's all, right?                     I mean, he actually came and joined his classmates at an event that he knew was an event that the school told the classes to go to.                As far as I'm concerned, he just showed up late.              Had you been just a disrupter, tough luck.              Who were the people that helped him hold up his flag?           Were they not classmates of his?              Did he not know that these classmates were there at a public event that was sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had directed the students to go?               So it seems to me it's like joining a school trip at the zoo, you know.                  You -- you don't make it to the -- to the school, but you drive there yourself and then join the class as it's going through the zoo.    It seems to me he's in school.              You think he could have been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't intend to be part of the school group afterwards?             I mean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a day truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy. And he shows up and he says, oh, you can't -- you have to hold me for a whole day's truancy because I didn't intend to be in school.         I was in school but I didn't intend to be there.              That doesn't make any sense to me.    Does it depend on his intent, whether or not he intended to be a truant that afternoon?              He was either in school or he wasn't in school.              In the afternoon he either was or he wasn't.             And the question is whether joining the school group, intentionally joining the school group, going there because the school group was there, whether that places him in school.              I thought you were going to appeal to the calm of her office the next day.                 I thought that was going to be your answer to my question. Whatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it later.

If they did consider it, you mean they did not respond to that argument in their opinion.              You don't know for sure that they didn't consider it.               I mean, it may be argument to them.     How could they not have considered it?   They must have not considered it important, but that's a different --              As I recall, he didn't just say it is bigger than Weaver.            He went on to discuss, you know, the drug gangs.         And he says, they're not going to be affected by the threat of going to prison. They will be affected by the threat of dying. It seemed to me he tied it very, very closely into deterrence.        And if you say that deterrence is okay for him to refer to, I don't know how there's anything left to your argument about his saying it's bigger than Weaver.               Where?           Where?   Where? Where?    Where does it say that?              Where does it say never mind the facts?     Let's, let's give this guy the death penalty as a Napoleon said, "Por encourage les autres." You know, he said it didn't matter which, whether the general was guilty of, of cowardice or not; it would help to encourage the others to execute him.                       Where is there anything like that argument here?                      I don't see it.               If you let a person who is as guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not just William Weaver, you're affecting the whole war on drugs, you're affecting the -- what's wrong with that? I -- I fail to see any indication here that he's telling the jury never mind the facts.                 Never mind how -- you know -- how horrible you think the crime was. Never mind all of the instructions that the judge gives you about aggravating factors and mitigating factors. Forget all of that.     Kill William Weaver because it's bigger than him. I -- I just don't -- I just don't see the argument.               Even -- even the Supreme Court cases going to the other points, they didn't -- did any of them involve a separate penalty phase?                  They were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital case, weren't they?               So that, so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging the jury to find a person guilty.                He was not just urging them what penalty is better or worse.                He was saying for these reasons you should find the individual guilty. That's quite different it seems to me from the situation in which guilt has already been established.   The trial's done.             This person is guilty, and the only thing they're arguing about is what the penalty ought to be.      I'm not sure that you can analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other in determining what kind of argument is proper.              Because in the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor says this is not just about this defendant, it's about the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the person guilty.    I mean -- and that's crazy.            You don't find the person guilty in order to stop drug trafficking. But you do impose a heavier penalty in order to do that.    So I just don't, don't see the analogy from the Supreme Court cases you have.             That's different.   Look -- it could -- could -- would defense counsel be able to argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, "ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch. You shouldn't find him guilt.              Is there no mercy in your heart?" Would he be allowed to argue that?             Of course not.     Can he argue it in a guilt phase?             Of course he can.     And it seems to me in determining what arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided by what arguments the defense can make. The defense can surely come in and say ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called upon to kill somebody.         Do you realize what a -- what a difficult, overwhelming thing that is? And then you say the prosecution can't come in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do your duty, you have to kill.              This is the law here.     If you find the facts this way, that's your duty. I -- I -- I think you're, you're taking hard cases very much out of context by applying cases that relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure that we've set up in capital cases which is called the guilt -- uh, the penalty phase.              The question has been switched here, Counsel.          The question before us is not whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty of Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these particular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have said it. That's not the question before us.             The question before us is whether it violates fundamental unfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it invalidates the whole prosecution and -- and sentence. That's quite a different question.             I can acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't do it.     But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that the, that the verdict has to be set aside.              Well, serve him right?         I mean, is that --               How do you answer the argument, fight for life, always fight for life?                     How do you answer that argument, except by saying:                     Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, sometimes it's your duty to vote for death?   How else would you answer that argument?              And was that this habeas? Then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?
06-340 +++$+++                Where is this?       Would you --               Of --              270 you say?              260.              I got it.               Can that be read just to apply to any, any State permits that -- that violate Clean Water requirements?            As opposed to upland habitat which -- which might be affected?             Well, how do you feel --              I thought that those are in place.     As I understood Mr. Kneedler to say that that's exactly what they, what they continue to do.              But that has nothing to do, as the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him, that has nothing to do with, with whether they have to issue the NPDES authorization.              Could I get back to the memorandum of agreement that you've called our attention to on page 260?     I read that paragraph, and I don't see anything in it that imposes any obligation whatever on the State.   It is just a description of what -- what EPA is, is going to do.               The same kind of consultation with Fish and Wildlife that, that Mr. Kneedler described to us.               But this is talking about consultation when the permit is -- the permit application is issued.         Not consultation at the, at the stage of approving the State plan.              I don't know what you're talking about.   Funding of what?              How does the government fund it?               Well, you -- you have other -- let's assume that I disagree with you on whether they could withhold approval of the NPDES transfer.    Even so, I think you -- the point you're making now is that apart from that approval, there were other discretionary actions taken here, one of which is this funding; and another one of which, I believe, is whether -- never mind the MOAs, but -- I have it written down here, one of the other ones.                  Oh, whether existing permits would be transferred to State authority or not. And that is apparently discretionary and can be -- what do we do about that?              I mean, that's not enough. Why wouldn't -- what would lead you to believe that it wouldn't -- that the same would not happen when the State issued the permits?          I mean, you have to show some reason why we don't trust Arizona to do what the Federal government's doing.              Well then, you have to establish jeopardy.     You have to establish jeopardy. And the mere fact that you're giving it to a State which Congress has been willing to trust with implementing this law is not enough to show that there's jeopardy. Prima facie, we would expect Arizona to do the right thing.             I don't understand --             I don't understand that answer.   The Chief Justice is asking, if EPA cannot do it itself, how is it creating any jeopardy in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't do it?             I mean, if you assume that EPA can't protect these plant species under its legislation, what harm is there in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't protect it?                By coercing, by coercing the States to sign those agreements on pain of not getting NPDES authority?                What do they do then?       They just whistle and this comes forth?                  States don't sign stuff just, just for the sake of it.               It's your position, not the Federal Government's position.                It's your position of what the Federal Government's position ought to be, right?
06-376 +++$+++                 Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as well as to (e)(1)?      Does it apply only to discretionary abatement provisions?             So what happens with (e)(2)?   You use the pay and sue provisions?             I don't, I don't even think it's technically correct.           How is it an abuse of discretion?    He has no discretion.                He must do it.      How could you say he has abused his discretion?                   What discretion?             But he doesn't even know what his tax liability is, especially in a partnership situation.             This is quite a different argument.    You're saying, you know, he should have paid the full tax in the first place, not he could have paid the interest that he knew was accruing.              Excuse me.       I didn't understand that.     Say that again?               There's no abatement for the interest that accrues until you're notified of what the --               The next thing you know, they will enact a progressive income tax. (Laughter.)             Is there a you cannot enter the courthouse provision here, or is it -- as I understand your case, it is that it remains discretionary with the Secretary with respect to people who have more money, but it is not discretionary with respect to people who have less money.             So one has a cause of action and the other doesn't have a cause of action. And the difference you're making between the two is you're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest with respect to the rich.           You're requiring him to do it with respect to the poor.           Isn't that the difference?              But it's permissive, not mandatory.              But he doesn't have --             Wait a minute.        They are not really saying that.        They're saying it's totally within your discretion.        You can't possibly abuse your discretion when you have total discretion.                  They're just saying, you know, do it if you want to do it.              And I would not concede, as you seem to have, that the consequence of (h) is simply to open the door.     I think the category of decisions that are committed to agency discretion by law within the meaning of the APA are agency decisions as to which the term "abuse of discretion" makes no sense.               There's no such thing.     It is totally committed to agency discretion.    It's only other decisions that are not committed to agency discretion by law where you -- where the discretion can be abused.               If you look at it that way, it isn't a matter of closing the door to one category and opening it to another; it's a matter of different substantive laws applying to the two, to the two classes.     Anyway, I choose to look at it that way. You can talk --
06-413 +++$+++               Well, you -- you -- you insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am going to be an unreliable juror.              That's -- that's not the way it happens.     And somebody has to evaluate whether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and whether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service. And some of these -- some of these answers suggest that. And it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you know, unless he comes out and admits yes, I'm going to be a lousy juror, nobody is going to say that.               Why -- why was there no objection if this was so clear?                If this fellow had answered all the questions the way you expect a, a good juror to answer, why was there no objection when the State moved to dismiss him?                Well, that's fine.          But, but competent counsel knows that getting something overturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it done right the first time.            And he also knows that if you raise an objection, you're more likely get it done right. I can't imagine why if he thought this person was not properly strikeable he would have sat -- indeed not just sat silent but said I have no objection. It just doesn't make any sense.              Well, he made the same mistake the judge did.      I wonder who else was there that made the same mistake.      I mean, you know, it makes you think maybe, maybe the judge was right.              Where -- where are you quoting from?              75 of the --              How many days did this take?              17 days?         Less than one a day.    That's pretty good.             Well, but he said for one of the other witnesses, I just don't -- I don't believe him.   And if that had been his problem here, he presumably would have said the same thing.             Not if there's no opposing objection by defense counsel.              When there was, and when part of his reason for granting the motion to strike the juror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.              Of what law?              Well, he said that, but elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider it unless it were a situation in which this person would be able to commit the crime again.              They did indicate that unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider imposing the death penalty.              I think that's precisely what they indicated.              I like recidivate by the way.     I'm going to use it in the opinion.                  It's a very useful verb.
06-427 +++$+++              But your claim here is not that they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is that they applied the rules.                 That's right.       Fairly. Fairly as they were written.              But you say even if they did apply them fairly, that's no good.                 I just wanted to be clear on that.              But not beneficial to the system.   That's why the organization didn't like it. And I wanted to come back to something you said just a minute ago, that there's an obligation under the First Amendment to weigh the effects of speech.                Is there?   I mean, suppose a government organization simply comes out with a rule that is perfectly fair, and that happens to give due weight to the fact that it's restricting speech, but the government organization has frankly never considered it.       They didn't sit down around a table and say now, look, this is going affect speech, let's be careful here.       They didn't do that.              They just promulgated a perfectly reasonable rule. Wouldn't we uphold that?              They don't have to consider the matter, do they?      They just have to get it right, whether they considered it or not.              Certainly.         We have to do that.   Certainly we have to do it in assessing whether, what the government has done is okay.                   But you're saying it's invalid unless the government gathers together a group of people just to shoot the breeze about -- I don't know of any of our cases that require that.              Well, I mean, you may criticize them when they get it -- when it comes out wrong.   Then you can say, when the result is wrong, they should have considered it.           But when it comes out right? Do you have any case where it comes out right and it's perfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even though it came out right, they didn't consider speech? We've never said anything like that.             That's where you had an approval system where one party would be approved and another one wouldn't.       Of course, in that situation, you have to engage case by case in making the weighing.                  But this is not an approval situation.                  It's the issuance of a rule that applies to everybody.              It was a letter from coach. It was a letter from coach.              I mean, that to a young kid, that is recruiting.           That is showing an interest on the part of the person who's going to decide who plays, an interest in you. I think it's entirely reasonable to consider that recruiting.             And did it say, by the way, everybody got this letter?           Did it say that at the bottom?
06-43 +++$+++      Could you amend that to say -- you don't insist that he make a statement that invest -- he could engage in a deceptive practice directed at investments?

06-457 +++$+++               I assume that the purpose of the Federal law was not to enable services which would not otherwise be provided at all, but rather to enable services to be provided more economically, to reduce the cost, the cost of interstate transportation.              Sure.       Somebody would come in to occupy the void, but he would charge a heck of a lot more.             Why wouldn't there would be a problem?    I don't understand that.                   There would still be a problem with uniformity from State to State.             Do you think if Maine did it for all products it would be okay?                    It's only they're doing it for tobacco that makes it bad?             I didn't think so.                 Where does that appear in the materials?     Do you remember where it is?                 But there's no text, though?              Ms. Brinkmann, I'm fascinated by this New York settlement.                You -- you say that -- that Maine can't do this.               But you say if a bunch of States do it, and they twist the carriers' arms hard enough by threatening criminal penalties, so that the carriers say, okay, I give up; and then they agree to limit their transport, that's okay?              Well, I mean you're speaking about the New York settlement as though that's hunky-dory.             I'm not sure that if this -- if this Federal act means what it says, that that kind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did not want to happen.             Voluntary under threat of criminal penalty.             Well, that's -- that's nice.   But what about the consumer?                     The act was not just for the convenience of the carriers.                      It was meant to -- to serve the convenience and the economic benefit of the consumer. I -- I expect a consumer might be able to challenge that -- that New York settlement.                      I'm surprised you accepted it as, well, you know, so long as the carrier coughs it up, it's okay.             Before you get into that, do we have to hold -- assuming we agree with you -- do we have to hold that the knowing requirement of the first sentence is okay?             -- even though the other provisions are not okay?    trouble with the knowing requirement.                 Fifty different States having a knowing requirement for a hundred different products -- I don't know that that complies with the Federal law.
06-480 +++$+++                Is that right?          I mean, You really think that antitrust policy means when -- any arrangement that produce a higher price is bad?               I mean, a lot of consumers want, you know, extended warranties.                     They want show rooms where they can go and look at things.                    All of which costs more money.         And where you can not have resale price maintenance the customers -- or you have the free rider problem.         The customers shop at the place that has the big show room, likes at all the product there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has not incurred that expense. Now, I just don't think that all the customers want is cheap.          I think they want other things besides cheap.    I think they want service.                  I think they want selection.    I think they want the ability to view goods and so forth.      Why do you discount all of those things?              Well, they aren't available.     This company thought that it could provide higher service if it could assure its retailers that they would not be undercut by people who are not providing that kind of service.              I don't, I don't know that there's no question about that.                There's certainly no question that this company was successful in breaking into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the service.             I don't understand that.         I mean, if it was really the case that they were going to be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been here.   I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the Targets.   They're not here on amicus briefs because they're -- what they're selling is cheap.                   They are selling price, and people who want low price and for whom that's of value above all other things are going to continue to go to those stores.              So they're not going to be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to provide not just the low price -- of course, they'll try to keep the price as low as possible -- but service. I just don't see what, what harm can possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, from allowing some people to make their money on service and -- rather than cheap price.               No, but it's a totally -- I cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare.                    It will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to give the retailer as much -- more money than the retailer is now making.         He's going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever. You know, horizontal conspiracy, the incentives are entirely different.                  When you're dealing with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product.              Well, if that's the case and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument.                But you -- but you want to say it's bad across the board for everybody.                  If indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the rule of reason would allow you to argue that.             I don't suppose there's any -- I don't suppose there's any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer, is there?                    I mean if indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a product that's more expensive than what he needs or -- and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned? I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the situation.             You're assuming that the -- that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good.    Why do you assume that?             He's only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants.         That's the whole purpose of it. And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin just as low as he can consistent with the -- you know -- consistent with selling as many products as he can.              I'm not sure it's often the case.   Give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.             Were they relying on Dr. Miles or were they relying on us?                   That's the question.             They left the situation where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as determined by this Court, and we had shown our willingness to update the antitrust law when sound economic doctrine suggests is necessary.               But some manufacturers want their product associated with excellent service, high warranty, and all of that.          And there is no way to get that uniformly for that product without this kind of agreement.              I guess Congress changed its mind then.              I find it hard to believe that. (Laughter.)
06-484 +++$+++               Well, but Congress just established an entry qualification for getting into court. And there are a lot of entry qualifications. In diversity cases, you -- if you allege diversity, and it existed at the outset, that's fine.                  That doesn't have to be proved at the end of the case.                Indeed even if you prove the contrary, the case is still validly there.   Congress can establish entry requirements even when they differ from, or have indeed nothing to do with the merits that the jury is supposed to decide.              Right.           And then on appeal, we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes, it is a strong inference. I mean, I hope we're going to establish some standards for how you go about determining whether there's a strong inference or not.             I think it's 66 and two-thirds.    I think that is -- (Laughter.)              What about clear and convincing?     Is it below clear -- I mean, they are the only two standards I actually understand.                 Without picking a number out of air, is preponderance, I think I can figure that out.      And I guess I can figure out beyond a reasonable doubt.          But other than those, when you talking about strong, when you talk about clear and convincing, I have no idea what those things mean. Do you?              You don't think they mean anything?              Let me write that down.         We should not take you literally.              All right. (Laughter.)               Mr. Miller, suppose Congress set up a entirely separate cause of action. It's caused -- it's called a discovery cause of action, okay?   And it sets forth as the condition for pursuing that cause of action a standard that your, your allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing. Okay? And then if you win that, you can take whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a lawsuit.     Would that be unconstitutional?
06-5247 +++$+++              I suppose you could say that of all the questions that go into habeas under 2254, that they could have brought up directly but the chances are their being taken here are negligible?
06-5306 +++$+++               What characteristics are you asserting follow from calling it jurisdictional in this case?              Number one, it can't be waived, right?              Number two --              The court of appeals has to inquire on its own, right?              Anything else?              Except at least as to the second, at least as to the second, I don't know of any matter that a court has to inquire into sua sponte which is not jurisdictional.      That's the one of the three characteristics that I think we have always attached the word "jurisdictional" to, I think.              It may.              But not must.              Not must.        And truly with things we have called jurisdictional, you must, right?              We could call it "quasi-jurisdictional."       You wouldn't object to that?               Well, what do you think is the --
06-531 +++$+++              What if they got a TRO instead of a preliminary injunction?             I know you aren't.      Why not?             What are the two?      I mean, they prevailed.    They have a TRO here, something of value.              But it's just prevails.        If you think "prevails" means you come out of there with anything that's worth something that has a contempt citation behind it, I don't see why a TRO wouldn't qualify.              Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction?         The fees that you reasonably expended in seeking a preliminary injunction, even though you lost, you'd be able to charge to the other side?             Yes or no?          I think you can answer yes or no.             Okay.             No.     No.      No.   How much of it related to the preliminary -- you mean anything that related only to the preliminary injunction you would be denied?              I don't know what you mean, if the decision on what?         On the preliminary injunction?              Is repudiated by the district -- how is it repudiated?                    What do you envision?                In a later case, you mean?               I thought the hypothetical was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment on the merits; and at that point -- okay -- at that point, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from the preliminary injunction.               Assume you win on the merits.             That included a screen.             But your people didn't want a screen.             So they didn't get what they asked for.             Well, that's only because, I guess the other side didn't take the action that they could have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply the screen.             Did they conduct the demonstration with a screen or without a screen?             Did they conduct the demonstration with or without a screen?             And since they didn't use the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting them; is that correct?             So they did not get what they asked for.   Mainly a prohibition against the state interfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted, which was one without a screen.              You say they didn't get that.             The state had no problem with that.   In the past the State had let them do that, as long as they had the screen.                But see, it's so extraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay for his attorney.    We don't even do that -- we don't even do that for guilty people when they -- when the other side wins.     So they have violated the law.               We still don't make them pay the other side's attorney's fees.   Now you want us to pay your client's attorney's fees even though you're not dealing with a guilty party, because ultimately the court found no, there really, this person didn't violate the law. That is -- you know, that's double indemnity.   I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary departure from our usual practice, which is that each side pays his own.      It's one thing to say well, if you're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil rights cases, we'll make you pay the other side.                  But it's another thing to say if you're -- if you're not a bad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky enough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll make you pay for the other side.                 It just grates that that -- it ain't fair.               I assume that Congress doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair.                  And if there are various interpretations, one of which is not grossly unfair, that's the one we should --             Well, you surely wouldn't say that the fact that the other side never shows up means that you can't get your attorney's fees.             So you're a prevailing party whether there's an adversary on the other side or not.
06-5618 +++$+++               As closely as it can, and the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury. Suppose in this case the court of appeals instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it? And then in the next case that comes up involving what was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of cocaine powder rather than crack, okay?                Suppose in the next case it would have been 30 grams of powder.                And the district court judge once again departs just the way the departure was here, and the court of appeals says no, that departure is unreasonable. You now have circuit law which says 30 grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams, you're entitled to a lesser sentence.                  Okay? Why isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan?                   You have fact findings being made by the judge.                  It's a judge who decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams.                   What difference does it make whether that factual difference produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a series of opinion by a court of appeals?                  Isn't the Sixth Amendment equally violated?              But if you have two cases that are in other respects similar, and the court of appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower sentence.              Why, why do we assume that the district judge cannot depart from the guideline recommendation unless he thinks the guideline recommendation is unreasonable?              He doesn't -- does he have to find it's unreasonable?              There can certainly be two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation to select the guidelines sentence, is he?              So he doesn't have to determine that it's unreasonable.                I don't think we should approach the discussion as though that's, that's the situation.               But what happens when that case -- it goes back down to the district court.                 The district court says well, okay, not 10 years.                 Nine years.   Okay?     It goes back up.             I mean, you know, when do we end this game?         Or does the court of appeals take over the sentencing function and specify -- you know, five years?              Well, it wouldn't be, just be procedural only.      You -- you could say procedural plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on which the district court was -- was proceeding.                 So you, if you could find that the determination that this was just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.
06-562 +++$+++               So you say there are two factors which still exert pressure to settle.                   One is that you don't have to bear the burden of showing that you conform with the national contingency plan, and second, that --              -- you insulate yourself from contribution suits by other people.              Do you rely at all on -- in 9607(a)(b)?     It says any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person.                    Does the word "any" add anything to your case?                 Do you think it urges us to give the broadest possible interpretation to other person?              Other necessary costs?              Now you say this very language that's in 107 now had been interpreted unanimously by the courts?              So that part of your case is that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say that there's been an implied repeal.              Unless all those cases were wrong.              So it's not just a legislative history point you're making, it's not just a point as to what Congress's expectations were.             It's also -- it's also a point that relates to implicit repeal.              And if the Government's only strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce settlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be very clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of action.             No acorns on the other side.                 Why wouldn't the States prefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113, so that the States would have, you know, a hand in deciding how the cleanup should go?                       I don't -- I don't quite understand why you're here.                  I would have thought that the States' interest would be similar to the Government's.                 The last sentence of (f)(1), right?                What's the meaning of that last sentence in (f)(1), "Nothing in this subsection shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action of contribution in the absence of a civil action," of a civil action under 9606 or 9607?              What are they referring to.                State law?
06-571 +++$+++               It's enough to say we don't usually talk that way.              That's the end of it.       We don't talk that way.       We don't say use a car when you buy a car.             Why -- why wouldn't making a material misstatement in order to obtain a gun constitute a use of the gun -- as much as it, the receipt of the gun constitutes a use of the gun here? What's the difference between the two situations?             Not if you believe Smith.             Not if you believe Smith.               Why?      There's -- they refer to crimes in which there has been a receipt but there has also been a conveyance.            Why do you focus on the receiver rather than the conveyer?               What are they?              Involved in -- that broadens that enormously, doesn't it?              It could be -- it could have -- it is intended to be used, not necessarily.                       As -- as your opponent pointed out, this section does not focus on the individual.           It focuses on the firearm, simply for -- for confiscation of the firearm.                    And, therefore, it suffices if either side intended it to be used.     It doesn't have to be the recipient who intended it to be used even though it's a receipt crime.                    It was intended to be used by the other side.                    Wouldn't that make sense?              What page is that?             Maybe they were doubtful about whether the "possession" thing applies here.             I don't know.    Possesses a firearm in furtherance of the crime -- I mean, the crime has been completed by the time the -- the person who is receiving the gun has possession of it.               It's hard to say it's in furtherance of the crime when the crime is over once he gets it.   His possession is not in furtherance of the crime, it seems to me.        It's the other person's possession that's in furtherance of the crime.                     He possesses it so he can turn it over, which is the crime. But I mean I'm just not all that sure that you have a hundred percent easy case on the possession point.
06-5754 +++$+++               And presumably cannot give weight to factors that the commission decided should have weight.             He doesn't have to do it unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.              Or some fact, not necessarily a particular fact.               So long as the jury determines the facts that make them similar.               The problem here is what makes them similar.             Well, you're -- I mean, this is a self fulfilling prophecy.                    You're saying if you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going to have uniformity.     Well, I -- my goodness.                 Is that consistent with the notion that the guidelines are advisory?             But that's just inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct, that the district judge can simply disagree with the basic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply disagree with the fact that the commission considers white collar crime, for example, something that should justify incarceration.             Is the system that you're describing any different for mandatory guidelines that are subject to departure when the district judge finds a significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines had?              Wherein is it different?
06-593 +++$+++                It wouldn't take a whole lot of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to his mother, who could then hire.               I mean, a clever lawyer would think of that, I think. (Laughter.)               And perhaps there are people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see through that kind of thing.             Well, it could have said a lot of things.    But I find it -- you're hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment. Wow.   You know, I just don't see how there's any difference in those two at all.              You're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be.      If there were a difference, I'm not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.              Can I ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552. -- what is it, 109? I think they are contradictory. Now, the Agency has come up with a solution. We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but -- you know -- close enough for government work. What is your solution for solving the inconsistency?     Are both of the regulations bad?              What's your other reason?              Because of employed and domestic employment versus --              -- domestic service?              Well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute.            I'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference.                And you have two regulations that are conflicting.                Now, how do you decide which one prevails?                Counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general, certainly an ancient prescription. Counsel also says that this is an agency regulation.     The agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations.                     And even if the agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?              That's statutory.        I just want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the statutory --              They aren't unambiguous. They contradict each other.              The agency has to do something about it, and here the agency made a choice. Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake.         One or the other had to be the mistake.     We decided it was this one.                  Why shouldn't we take their word on it?               Yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking.                  You know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate about interpretive regulations.               In fact, probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations.                I understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other.                  What do you rely on for that?                Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?               They're different but not necessarily of different -- entitled to different respect from the courts.         A defined -- what is it, define and delimit?     These are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the -- this rule won't apply to companies over this -- that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute. So Congress says we're going to give the agency that authority.       In addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret -- interpret the language of the statute.              Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.             You mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those -- those regulations -- those provisions that were adopted by Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently. Do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding?
06-618 +++$+++                The other side's contention is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so when you challenge the firing you are challenging the legislative act.   What do you say to that?              It wouldn't matter anyway, because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer to jurisdictional questions are not authority on jurisdiction.              We have that firm rule When we take a case and don't get into the jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the fact -- -              Yes.      That, that may make sense.    I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for an appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the Speech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation itself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a violation of speech.              Yeah.
06-6330 +++$+++                  Well, that's why -- and the 1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did indeed require the guidelines to track the -- the statutory prescriptions for sentencing.                 Pardon me?                 2003.       Sorry.   I misspoke. But -- but the fact remains that the Guidelines are only guidelines and that still doesn't-- doesn't convert to an obligation for the district courts to follow that scheme so long as that scheme is only reflected in the guidelines.             The guidelines themselves are still just advisory.                Well, why don't you just skip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the sentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a sentencing judge -- never mind the Guidelines -- to do anything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription that Congress has established?                I don't know what the Guidelines add to -- to your game except another -- another stage.              Well, I would say that that statute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing, whether it's through the commission or not, be based on the 100 to 1 ratio.              It seems to me that the gap in your argument is that whatever Congress legislated, it did not legislate the manner in which you transferred this 100 to 1 ratio onto the sentencing chart. And as your opponent points out, it isn't done proportionally.        It could have been done in a lot of different ways.                Maybe.           But there are other logically proportional manners of doing it.                       Why would the district court be bound to the particular one that the Sentencing Commission chose?                That's fine.          I'm granting that they got a start where Congress did.                      I'm assuming that.   But why do they have to follow it through the way the Sentencing Guidelines did?
06-637 +++$+++               What did it do, then?         What meaning do you give to it?              I don't understand that. It makes it very clear it is, it is (ii) which authorizes the enrollment in a private school and payment for that.    And it is prefaced with a condition: If the parents of a child with a disability who previously received special education and related services under the authority of the public agency, enroll the child in a private -- the implication is if there were parent of a child who was not so enrolled, this provision does not apply.               So then you fall back on the fact that the old provision covered in our cases would have applied but that makes this meaningless. I mean if you say that our prior cases overrode that limitation, then what purpose does the limitation serve?                Where else does it say that the city will pay for the cost of a private education except there?   That's the only place it says it.              And part of the requirements for getting it is that the child was receiving service at a public institution.              I'm not sure I agree -- Im not sure I would agree with you that you could get special services which --in third grade and then come back 10 years later and get private school tuition.                I would really read this as saying if the parents of a child who previously received special education under the authority, enroll the child in a public elementary school -- I think that there has to be a temporal connection between the prior receipt and the enrollment. I don't think you can go back 10 years.                You don't have to read it that way, anyway.                Once you're in the private school reimbursement you're in the private school reimbursement, but you can't get into it 10 years later. Anyway, that issue is not -- not before us today. I don't understand you assertion that somehow this would amount to repeal by implication.                   The provision of 1415 -- what is it, (b), (b)(3) -- it seems to me is just like a provision for, for a court's exercise of its equitable powers.                 "Shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate" -- if a court had granted some equitable relief in one case, and then there is a statute that's passed which renders that equitable relief no longer appropriate, I wouldn't say that that -- that that amounts to a repeal by implication.    It's just that what is appropriate depends upon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at the time that the relief is sought.             Bingo. You got me on that.               No, he hasn't -- he hasn't said that.               Under a different statute.              You are interpreting some very general language:      "Shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate."              So does the 10-business-days notice requirement for people who are in public schools also violate Burlington, because for 10 business days they are going to be subject to an inappropriate education?              Well, that's no problem.          I mean both sides agree that you can move to a private school if that's so; right?               Except those -- there are a lot of parents who are going to send their parents to private school, no matter what.                They are well-heeled and this is just an opportunity to have New York City pay $30,000 of it.               Even the child who would turn down the adequate education provided by the public schools.    I don't think that was the intent of the statute.                If they don't have an adequate placement, they should not have to pay the freight for people who would not be coming to public school any way.     That's what this provision prevents.
06-6407 +++$+++               More than that, the section goes on to make an exception from the bar of second or successive.    The exception itself is a situation in which he could not have raised it earlier, namely he can get out of the bar if he shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, which he couldn't have raised before, or the factual predicate didn't exist before, which he couldn't have raised before. All of those exceptions would be unnecessary if we interpret the provision itself to contain within it an exception for anything that couldn't have been raised before.               The Constitution doesn't require Federal district court review.               Okay, I got that.       So should we treat this petition as if it's one for original habeas here?

06-694 +++$+++              Or just good honest liars, right?   I had thought that the purpose of the First Amendment was to protect speech that had some value, and that the reason obscenity is excluded entirely from First Amendment protection is that it has no redeeming social value. What social value do you find in being able to lie about the content of what you're offering to somebody else?   You say somehow if you're lying about it, oh, well, then the First Amendment protects that.               I would think if you're lying about it, it is clearer than ever the First Amendment doesn't protect it.             There is no social value in protecting lies.               But it depends on what they're lying about.      If they're lying about the value of what they're selling, you know, it's fraud.               Tell me what social value are we protecting here, by protecting the lie about whether this thing that really isn't child pornography is?   What -- why would we want to protect that?              Are you complaining about the degree of the penalty?               You seem to think we are punishing the lying.      I don't read the statute as punishing the lying.               But, in fact, the statute does not provide extra penalty.              It just provides a penalty for pandering.       And I don't know why it's a good defense to that to say, oh, I was actually lying.                 I mean --               All of those verbs only become pandering when they are attached to explicit sexual material.     When you promote explicit sex, you are pandering.   I mean, the word pandering does have a sexual connotation.       I -- I think -- I had thought it was accepted that we have here a statute that's directed against pandering.              Why would it lessen?           I assume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these other situations that are not before us are not covered. Isn't that the most blatant dictum?                     But -- but -- and, of course, we're not bound in later cases by our dicta. But come to think of it, I guess the whole doctrine of overbreadth rests upon dictum, doesn't it?                      It -- it rests upon our determination in this case, which involves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child porn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in this case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases, where we would not hold the person guilty.                      That is all dictum, too, isn't it? So I guess the whole doctrine is -- is based on dictum.    So we may as well put it in all an appendix. Let's put our dictum in an appendix.                      I agree.

I thought you're saying that if it is a process in which party affiliation is shown, then your endorsed candidate should be set aside somehow.              I suppose you could say the same thing about the candidates' party preferences. They can make that known to the voters in the newspapers when they run.              I don't have the Republican Party endorsement, but I prefer the Republican Party.

06-766 +++$+++              That's a general election case, isn't it?              Mr. Schwarz -- I'm sorry, go ahead.              The person wouldn't be opposed if he approached the boss and the boss said: Yeah.   Boy, I really like you.               That person would automatically not be a rebel.               He'd be part of the establishment. (Laughter.)               Of course not.     You're really arguing against the whole purpose this scheme, which is not to have judges popularly elected.                 And you're saying no, we want them popularly elected.                    The purpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people elect delegates and have delegates use their good judgments as to who -- as to who the best judge would be.   But you say, no, we want the people to have an input.     I mean, it's contrary to the whole purpose of the scheme.     Of course it works the way you say it does. It is designed to work that way.                 It's a basic judgment not to have judges popularly elected, and your objection amounts to saying no, judges ought to be popularly elected.
06-7949 +++$+++               What if -- what if the sentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines? He just simply disagrees with the severity of the sentence that the Guidelines impose?                   He's free to do that, isn't he?              And so long as that disagreement is reasonable, so long as another sentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower sentence -- for antitrust violations, if indeed all the Federal Courts before -- before the Guidelines came into effect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how could you say it would be unreasonable for a district judge to say, I simply agrees with what the Guidelines -- with what the Sentencing Commission did, and I agree with all of those sentencing courts before then, which thought -- which thought only in a rare case should there be jail time?          How could you possibly say that that's unreasonable?              But we also made it very clear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is -- there is no way to a maintain that with the -- with the kind of approach that you're offering.                  They aren't advisory.   They're pretty much mandatory.                 You depart too much and you'll be called to account.               You cannot disagree on policy with the Guidelines, then, at least not fundamentally?               I don't know how that -- that fits in with your prior statement.              Well, then -- then you're just blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are advisory.     What you're saying is the criterion for fairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one side or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being fair.   That -- that's not -- that's not advisory. That's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing.              Well, he did that here.   He said, you know, I think a young person like this -- other people may feel differently, but I think somebody at 21 really is -- is not -- his brain isn't fully formed and we should give him another chance.              We should probably make them mandatory.             We're trying to development a rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the courts of appeals when they are reviewing the innumerable sentences of federal district judges. And you have -- you haven't given me a rule. I have no idea -- if I were sitting on the court of appeals, I would have no idea when I can do it and when I can't do it. The notion of reasonableness, you know, whether a reasonable person could have given a sentence of this sort despite the fact that it is not what the Sentencing Commission did, that's -- that's something you can work with, but I don't understand what your rule is.              I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't say that.      There are -- there are certain -- certain limits where you would -- the example you gave of that kind of an acceleration of the penalty, and I can see giving this person no jail time whatever would be extreme. But if you are trying to get a narrow range of sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me you're just working in opposition to what our opinions have said which is that the guidelines are advisory. And they're not mandatory.             Mr. Dreeben, you're -- you're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was downward, but you're -- the principle you apply, you would apply for upward departures as well?             Doesn't there get to be a constitutional problem where -- where the court which is establishing these -- these ranges that you want has held, after a series of decisions, that basically you cannot get 30 percent over -- over the guideline range unless particular facts exist?              And it has specified those -- those facts in prior decisions.                At that point, in order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the guidelines, that fact becomes necessary for the conviction and -- or for the sentence, and, therefore, you would need the jury to find it.              That's what common law adjudication always amounts to.              By trial and error, one case, the next case, you eventually end up knowing what is necessary in order to give 30 -- 30 percent over. Unless you're accomplishing that, I don't know what you're accomplishing.              He said this fact is okay. You can go 30 percent above with this fact.                 So then in the next case, the district judge says, I find that this fact exists and therefore you get 30 percent above the max, and the court of appeals affirms, but the jury has never found that fact.              It left open -- it left open case-by-case adjudication.               It left -- application review.    And I'm saying that in the application review of that case, you'd have to say you needed a jury finding.
06-8120 +++$+++               Even, even when the reason the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon? You would still say that, that the show of authority is only directed at the driver and hence it is only the driver that's seized?              That's the right answer.     I think you're being consistent.              You have to say that. You have to say that.              Tell the truth now. (Laughter.)              Okay. (Laughter.)             Well, but the policeman usually tells the drive and anybody else in the car: Stay in the car.    Policemen don't like people jumping out of the car.    They don't know why they're jumping out of the car.    And I would certainly if I were a passenger not feel free to immediately open the door and start walking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman to tell me:    Get back in the car.               Isn't that, isn't that the normal procedure, to keep the occupants in the car until the policeman investigates?             Well, even if he didn't tell me.   I would have expected him to tell me.                I wouldn't even open the door because I know he would tell me.   I know that I'm not free to leave the car immediately until he investigates the stop.              Right.           I never pass a police car.    I don't care how slow I'm going.                     I never pass a police car.      I don't consider myself arrested just because that's the prudent thing to do, and it may well be a similar situation when you're sitting in a car that's been stopped by a traffic policeman.              You're saying he doesn't have actual authority.         If I understand you, you're saying he has no authority to stop an innocent passenger from walking away.      Aren't you saying that?                Unless there's some reason to hold a person in the car, he has no authority to stop him from walking away.              What if I feel, even though that's the current state of the law, I wouldn't think of opening the door and walking away without asking the policeman, do you mind if I open the door and walk away? Does that suggest that I think I've been seized?              Maybe we can just pass until the studies are done? (Laughter.)
06-8273 +++$+++                 Yes, that's correct.   You have to say that's correct. (Laughter.)              But I think you can also explain that the reason it's correct is the Court probably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a new rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and this rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by individuals from now on.         But then, you know, Justice Harlan says my goodness, you're going to give relief to this individual and not give relief to other individuals who are making the same claim and already have cases pending?   You have to treat them equally.                 So we will make an equitable exception for that. But basically, the existence of that exception does not prove that the Court was not purporting to make a substantive rule.                  There's an exception to the application of that substantive rule for pending cases, which is totally understandable.               I'm really glad to hear that. (Laughter.)               Don't we call it a new rule in Teague?              You are saying metaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new constitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done so, and Teague is full of references to new rules.             "We therefore hold that implicit in the retroactivity approach we adopt today is the principle that habeas corpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants." The opinion is full of new rules. So -- so, you know, we have violated metaphysics already.      Having violated it, in adopting new constitutional rules, why should it be any surprise that we also violated it in the application of those rules?   There should be no surprise at all.            Don't get hung up on metaphysics, Mr. Turner.              You wouldn't want to say that, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the position of saying what we are telling people in these Teague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated, but we don't want to hear about it.                    I mean that's the alternative, to acknowledge that the Constitution is violated in all of these Teague cases, some of them being capital cases, and we nonetheless say well, too bad, it's on habeas. I'd like to think that's not what we're doing, that what we're saying is, this is a new constitutional rule, there was no constitutional violation before, and that's why we're letting it stand.
06-84 +++$+++              It's pretty sloppy lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be considered to have -- wow.          This is a standard?              Any action that can even be considered to have a negative impact.              This is guidance?              But you know, I would tell my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.
06-856 +++$+++                 Is it entirely clear that the plan itself does not have any money to pay this off unless it takes the money from other individual accounts?   I thought one of the briefs said that -- that some plans have independent funds.                   I forget what sources they came from, but some slush fund that they could use for this purpose.              It wasn't called a slush fund.   I know that. (Laughter.)             You know I could understand your case if you said even if there were a hundred diamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there still is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has been held liable to make up for the loss.               Up until that point, it's just a loss in each of the individual accounts. But you're not willing to say that.                  You say at some ineffable point it becomes a loss to the plan. I think there is a clear line between -- between saying there is no loss to the plan unless -- unless the plan is first adjudicated to be liable; then there is a loss to the plan.             Prior to that it's just a loss to the individual account.             That makes some sense. I mean, I can understand how that works.               I can't understand how your system works.               You're telling me it depends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind of a breach it was.     How can we write an opinion like that? (Laughter.)              What's done meanwhile?             He came in right at the bottom and a week later, it had gone up 30 points.              -- no remedy?
06-9130 +++$+++              It's also --             It's also not entirely clear what -- whether it's a tail or not.                It depends on what the dog is.    If you can -- if you were trying to identify the most common instances, especially at the time this provision was enacted, the most common instances in which property was detained by the government, I mean you know, later -- later forfeiture provisions are numerous, but at that time I think they were relatively few.      I think the dog would have been -- would have been customs and excise officers.            And the "or other officers" would have picked up probably very little real -- real instances of property detention.              Do the members of Congress who voted on this language, when it was presented to them, did they even know who Judge Holtzoff was?              Did he testify to this effect before one of the committees?               15 years before it was passed, right?             There are two "anys" here. I'm not sure that --             Any other.       So it says any goods by any officer of customs or excise, or if it just had said "other law enforcement officer," you might -- you might disregard the force of any because it was way back there.             But if they repeat "or any other law enforcement" --
06-923 +++$+++                 Dictum.                What I don't like about the dictum is I don't know what it means.                I think it's lovely to say weigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket and it's fine.    But what does it mean?  perfectly reasonable decision that is within the discretion -- I mean this plan says that MetLife will have -- knowing that it will have the conflict, that they will make the decisions and so long as they are not arbitrary, they are valid. Now, let's take a perfectly reasonable decision.   It is not arbitrary.              Does giving weight to the existence of the conflict which the settlor of the plan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean that what was reasonable becomes unreasonable?               If it doesn't mean that, then it means nothing.              Trust law doesn't say. Trust law does not establish a different standard of judicial review for the conflicted trustee.               And --               But you say that one of the things that can make it unreasonable is the mere fact that there exists this -- this conflict.               That renders what is a perfectly reasonable decision unreasonable.                 I --               I don't understand that. In very -- what kind of a standard is that, "in very close cases"?    How is -- how are you going to review a court?   I mean, give it some weight in very close cases? It slops over.    This is not a standard.                I don't know -- I don't know what you're telling the courts to do.               Well, I don't mind reasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion. But you're telling me that even when the reasonableness standard is met, if there is this conflict, if it's close -- how close is close?              You -- suddenly it flops over the edge.    I mean, you know, close to the out -- it's -- it's beautiful art, but I don't understand how it turns into law.              I don't think you're at all saying that it's the same standard of review.                 You keep saying that, and your friend said it, but it's not the same standard of review.          You say it's still the reasonableness standard of review, but then you say, however, the mere fact of the existence of the conflict does at the edges make unreasonable what used to be reasonable.    That is a different standard of review.               It means you are not using a single reasonableness standard of review.    You're arguing for a second standard of review that is so vague I don't know what it means.                 Why not just say that the district court, when there is a conflict of this sort, has to spend two more hours considering the case? (Laughter.)              There's a clear rule, you know.                Well, if you're going to do that, you have to tell me how much it weighs.                   You see, if you use it in step two when things are in equipoise, it doesn't matter how much it weighs.                    It's enough if it weighs a feather.    In the equipoise case you come out the other way. But if you're going to use it in the first structural system to determine, you know, how much each side -- I have to know its weight.                  And there is no indication whatever as to what its weight is.                   It's really up to the district judge, I guess, to decide how much weight he is going to give to the fact that there is this conflict.                I'm not weighing reasonableness.    I'm weighing that factor of the conflict.   That's what you ask us to weigh.                It's not reasonableness.                Then you should only use it as a tiebreaker, I suggest, if you can tell me.
06-937 +++$+++               But it's subsequent conduct.   If the implied license occurred, it didn't occur at the time of the sale; and it couldn't be -- it couldn't be negated at the time of the sale.                 If it occurred, it occurred at the time of the license, right, from the patentee of the patent at stake.                And there was no such notice there.   There was no such statement there that this does not -- you don't have the right to sell this for its normal uses?                Yeah, but the horse is out of the barn.                That -- I mean if both parties -- if both parties agree to that notice, I guess that would be something else.               Did both parties agree to that notice?                Yes.              Yes, but that -- that doesn't matter to me.      What matters to me is whether it was prior to the license.          If there was an implied license here, it occurred at the time that the --              No.     No.              You give the licensee -- you implicitly give the licensee the right to permit the people to whom he sells the product to use the license.              But it's given to the licensee surely.              Unless it's implicit, unless it's implicit when you sell a -- a bicycle pedal that can only be used in bicycles.              Did you say that?              That's the notice.       That's later.     That's downstream.         That's after the license. That's at the time of the sale.              Mr. Phillips, when you say that was resolved adversely, you say there was a finding of no implied license.              Was that a finding of no implied license from LGE to Intel or no implied license from Intel to the buyers?              Is that the crucial -- is that the crucial step?                 If that --                 If that was an implied license from LGE to Intel, then Intel would have authority to sell -- to sell these things for their -- for their use.                 I think the exhaustion, if Intel got -- if Intel got -- I'm sorry.                   Yes, if Intel got an implied license to the system from LGE when it sold those products, it seems to me the exhaustion doctrine would take hold and would -- would apply to that implied license just as it applied to the -- to the license of the chips.
06-939 +++$+++              But the --             The difference between this and Rust is that the Federal Government in Rust was assuredly following a Federal policy.             But it was a Federal policy that the Federal Government had every right to implement.   We do not want to support abortions.             The issue here is whether the policy that California is trying to implement -- namely, we do not want the employer to -- in its view -- disrupt the -- the labor management relations by -- by opposing union -- unionization.             That -- that is the issue, whether that is a policy that California can -- can implement.              Why?      Because it's wasting the money or because that is their --              -- their labor policy?              Just like -- like Gould.      I mean, there is a case where a State used State money, no contracting with any -- with any company that's been convicted of unfair labor practices three times. Strictly State contracting policy, we just don't want to spend our money dealing with such a person.              Why wouldn't that be the State's managing its own money?             It's our money.              We just don't want to deal with people who oppose unions.              I think your reason for not paying for this activity is that you don't like this activity.              I call that -- I call that regulating the activity.              Well, you allow the employer to engage in all other employee relations, and you're willing -- that can be done without -- the one thing the employer can't do is speak out against the union.     This isn't because you don't --             Well, the question of when the contract is done is different from the question of when the money is paid.             He is asking with when the money is paid.               You're not going to go through all of these one by one, are you?               Let me ask you a basic question that doesn't require you to get into one by one.   Suppose you have a State that doesn't want to have its money used to assist unions.                This is an antiunion State and it adopts the same kind of law that you have. And it simply says, none of -- none of this State's -- yes, you can recognize unions if you like, but none of the money that we give you --              -- shall be used -- shall be used for collective bargaining or for any -- any activities involving unions.              Same.       Yes.              To the employer.         No employer getting money from the State can expend any of our money -- the same way yours is -- in collective bargaining with unions or in anything else.                  Now, we are not stopping employers from doing that.                  We just don't like unions, and it's our money and we don't want this employer to use it for unions.             Would that be all right.             Why does that -- why does that make a difference?         If it violates Federal policy, it violates Federal policy.             Livadas said you can't do it because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor unionization, and not to deter.             You could say the same about that other one.             So does the statute I posit.   Just don't use State money.                     You can use all of your own money to deal with unions; just we don't want our money used for it.             That clearly would be banned and I don't see why yours is any different.
06-969 +++$+++               You are asking for that among other things, aren't you?              Why do you say that those issue ads are inconsistent with the Government's position here?              You haven't explained that. You're just --              When they put these exhibits, were those exhibits complete with context?              I didn't think so.      They just -- just like the ads were.                It's pretty easy to tell whether you're giving money to the money to the candidate or not, isn't it?                That's a fairly bright line that you don't have to worry about stepping over the wrong side of it.                Whereas this one, especially if you adopt a context determination that requires a 1,000-page district court opinion, who knows.              What's your test?       Their test is fuzzy, I agree with you.                What's yours?    Do you have a clear one that does not invalidate the whole statute?              That says what's good. What is your test for what's bad?              Mr. Bopp, you do not have to establish, do you, that the test you propose will get at every bad ad, that it will be sure to get at every ad that is not a genuine issue ad? Is that the burden on you?              I thought when we're dealing with the first amendment we give wide scope to the principle that it is, it is better to allow, you know, some bad speech than it is, in the effort to get rid of that bad speech, to eliminate any good speech that is justified. So even if there is something that might sneak through that does achieve what Congress didn't want to achieve, the answer in the First Amendment is that's too bad.     There's some stuff you just can't get at.   There's a lot of bad speech that is allowed all the time because you can't get at it without suppressing the good speech.             You could say yes to that, I think.               He fears the Greeks even when they bear gifts. (Laughter.)              It could be as long as 200 days; isn't that correct.
06-984 +++$+++                 It just means we agree that the case can go before the court.                And we will be a party before the court.    Isn't there some doubt whether the -- the Senate and the President, together, can -- can take away from this Court the power and responsibility to decide what the treaty obligations of the United States are?                Isn't there some problem there?             Once again, there is a constitutional problem, is there not, if they are automatically enforceable?             That is conferring upon the ICJ the responsibility to decide the meaning of a United States treaty which is United States law.              I think it belongs in this Court.     And when you have a non-self-executing treaty, there is no problem. It becomes U.S. law when the Senate and the House pass a law which the president -- it doesn't become U.S. law because the President writes a memorandum to his Attorney General, but it does become U.S. law when a law is enacted.              That solves the constitutional problem, but in the situation we're talking about here, I don't know on what basis we can allow some international court to decide what is the responsibility of this Court, which is the meaning of the United States law.               A lot of people think that's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal habeas jurisdiction quite improperly.                     But it happens every day, doesn't it?              I think you misunderstood. I thought he was asking whether if it is -- assuming it is not self-executing, this Court can execute it.              They mean it does not automatically become part of United States law.              And it follows from that, that you have to change United States law?              And it is not the function of this Court to change United States law.              And he had lived in this country for how long?
06-989 +++$+++               What do you do about the fact that our opinions have said that there is another ground under 10, which is manifest miscarriage of justice?   That's not listed there.              Why -- why did we go -- go to the trouble of expressing it differently?              Why not just say Section 4?              What would happen in situations like this?       Suppose we agree with you; and we say, oh, yes, both of the parties agreed as part of this contract:    I don't want to let these arbitrators decide the law.    If they get the law wrong, we want -- we want the courts to decide the law.              That's the deal.   And then you're going to say, oh, that portion of the contract is no good.              Is there no such thing as -- as failure of the contract for a misunderstanding of the law?                Assume we agree with you that this is a quick and dirty way to get arbitration agreements enforced if you want to bring it within 9 and 10, and if you don't, you're free not to; you can go to the State courts.     Why can't he still go to the State courts? You say this is going to terminate the litigation.     Is this going to be res judicata on anything?     All it's going to say is the Federal courts have no jurisdiction over this.                It's not under 9 and 10.   You're going to run off to State court.               You're going to protract the litigation rather than bring it to a quick end.              I don't understand that.                 But -- but the old Illinois and the old New York rules, you don't have any cases which say -- which establish that those rules were not just default rules, but you -- but you were not allowed to depart from them.                 You don't -- you don't have any case that holds that?                 You don't have any case that holds that.              Why couldn't you limit it reasonably by saying the parties can agree to anything? We would only have to say at least, the parties can at least agree to anything that the court would be able to do if this had been brought as an action in the court, rather than initially as an arbitration.                Which means the court would decide the questions of law.                I understand, but that would be a limit.    You say it's limitless.                   It doesn't have to be limitless.
07-1015 +++$+++                Well, you -- you could have said the same thing about the existence of a conspiracy in -- in the antitrust case.              I mean, that was the argument.    How can we prove an agreement until we have discovery?               We say you need something more in order to go forward, something more than, you know, you prevented these people from talking to Johnny Cochran.   That's not going to do it.                Well, there are two possibilities here.       Number one is the possibility that there was a general policy adopted by the high-level officials which was perfectly valid and that whatever distortions you are complaining about was in the implementation by lower level officials.                  That's one possibility. The other possibility, which seems to me much less plausible, is that the -- the high-level officials themselves directed these -- these unconstitutional and unlawful acts.                Well, I mean, that's lovely, that -- that the -- the ability of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI to -- to do their jobs without having to litigate personal liability is dependent upon the discretionary decision of a single district judge.   I mean, I thought that the protection of qualified immunity gave them -- gave them more than that.             It doesn't give them much, if that's all it gives them.             But they pleaded a conspiracy -- they pleaded a conspiracy in Bell Atlantic.    It wasn't a matter of not -- not setting forth in the complaint the substance of what produced liability.    They pleaded conspiracy.              When?              Does it say when?    Does it say what basis?              I don't know on what basis any of these allegations against the high-level officials are made.             Well, we'll -- we'll check that.             The Solicitor General contests that.               Is -- is no penological interest enough?               I mean, is that the only basis -- after an attack on the country of the magnitude of 9/11, is that the only basis on which people could be held?   Namely that these people are the -- are the guilty culprits, and we are going to put them in jail?             Surely for at least a period, you can hold people just -- just to investigate?             Well, it wasn't solely on that.             But the net was surely not cast wide enough if anybody with that race, religion was -- was swept in.             I mean, if it's solely for that reason, there would have been hundreds of thousands of others.             -- implausible.
07-10374 +++$+++                 They're -- they are liable in Federal court.                They're certainly not immune in Federal court.             General Underwood, your friend on the other side acknowledges that if New York states closed its courts to tort actions, that would be okay.   But I don't see how closing your courts to tort actions has any administrative -- particular administrative rationale behind it, do you?                He's still responsible, right?   I mean --                He's still responsible.                Even if it were, it would be discriminatory and invalid, right?                Or discriminatory.     It's picking on --               Even if it were, it would be discriminatory and invalid, right?               Or discriminatory.               That -- that's an important factor, I would think.       Let me ask another question.              It -- it's a standard rule of international law that no State will enforce the penal laws of another State.                I assume the Federal Government could not -- maybe I am wrong to assert this, but could the Federal Government require New York to prosecute federal crimes?               I don't, either, but I think it can't.   I think it can't, probably.            Then my next question is going to be:             Why aren't punitive damages penal laws as well?            And if that's the same principle, maybe there's no big deal about New York excluding penal damages --
07-10441 +++$+++                Mr. Dreeben, wouldn't -- wouldn't you still have this disincentive which -- wouldn't you still have this disincentive, which is considerable?    If you -- if you exceed the time limit, it may be taken into account in determining that the confession was involuntary.                Isn't that enough of a disincentive?    If you delay too long, that delay is one of the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether the confession was voluntary.             But isn't your -- I'm sorry.             I must be losing the thread of the argument.    It seems to me that MCNabb and Mallory only provide punishment for excessive delay where there has been a confession.      Isn't that right?              And so long as the length of the -- the delay can still be considered as one of the elements in determining that the confession -- that the confession is involuntary, there is still a degree of incentive based upon only the confession.           Now, it -- it may not be as high a degree -- that it is automatically excluded -- but the police are going to have to consider that any confession they may get within that period of excessive delay may be challengeable.             I knew you were going to get to 3501 eventually.              Mr. Dreeben, I tend to think that what we should be focusing on is the language of 3501.   Can I bring you back to that?                    What I do not understand about your argument is the following:                     The six -- the six-hour safe harbor applies only when the confession is made voluntarily, right? I would think that the proviso likewise assumes voluntariness.        That is, the time limitation contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation applicable to voluntary confessions.                     And it says that time limitation shall not apply in any case in which the delay in bringing the person is beyond six hours is found by the trial judge to be reasonable. I think you have already voluntariness assumed in the proviso, but you want us to go back and re --   reconsider voluntariness under (a).                I just don't think that's -- that's a fair way to read it.              Well, I am reading it that way, too.    Otherwise voluntary is in the safe harbor.              Then when you have a proviso, which refers to the time limitation contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation upon voluntary confessions.
07-1059 +++$+++              And those have been cases where the very same product is returned with value added, right?              No, old mills used to do that.   The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill, and it would be ground right there while he was waiting.              That's absolutely true.              Your brief constantly assumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the entire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately becomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same feedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately delivered.    And that is simply not true.                There is a change -- there is a change of ownership.                  The feedstock that somebody else put into the mix is now transferred to the -- to the electric utility.              That's exactly right.    You don't know.     So, you had cannot say that there has been no transfer of ownership.              No, we've got the same molecules.     I mean, when you are talking about whether there has been a transfer of ownership or a transfer of title, you are talking about molecules; you are not talking about whether you ended up the same in, you know, in monetary terms.           You are talk about whether you have the same thing that you delivered to the person overseas.     And you don't, or at least you can't say that you do.              That makes no sense, what you just said.     That contract makes no sense.              They hold title to it until they get the uranium rods, right?              Most of it is back overseas.     It's still mixed with the other fungible U 235.               Ms. Halligan, try this hypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the doubt.   Let's assume a department store buys raw wool from some sheep herder, sends it overseas.                    And it's worth $1,000, this raw wool.             It is processed, spun and knitted into sweaters, and then shipped back to the department store.    The sweaters, all made from the same wool, not even fungible, so that's why this is even better than your example -- the sweaters when they come back, are worth not $1,000, but $20,000. Do you think it would be unreasonable for the Commerce Department to treat that as a sale of sweaters by the European knitting wool or -- or home knitters who did the sweaters?               Say it again?               I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to the American department store.               A processing transaction. It has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what did I say -- $20,000?      And that's just processing?              They said there was no sale.              When the pasta was imported, there was no sale into the United States.              But that's what we are talking about here.              Get back to your pasta case.    Was the holding of that case that there was no sale into the United States?              That's a different issue. We are not talking here about which transaction establishes the price.        We are talking simply about whether there was a sale into the United States.                Now, wait.       Suppose these knitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their sweaters for a much higher price in Europe.                 Instead of $20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are selling it for $40,000.         And they nonetheless sell the wool back into the United States for only $20,000. You are telling me that that transaction doesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping law?                That you have to look at the price at which the department store then sells to individuals?                But the department store is not dumping.    It's -- it's the knitting mills that are dumping.                 Okay.       And accepting that, you -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with a sale, with a sale into the United States, right?                 And I thought this is -- this is what you say fails in this case.                     That is the link of the chain that doesn't exist.                     You say there is no sale in the United States.              What does -- what does the government do with respect to these other transactions where, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed uranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting the rods?              There is no down -- you know, there is no domestic sale there, either.                      Is it conceivable that there, therefore, can be no dumping in such a case?
07-1090 +++$+++               It's a long section.        Which part of the section --               Why -- why does it say then any other provision of law?              You know, Congress could have explained its more narrow purpose in a few words.              Oh --              Who's paying for these shipments?   I mean, is that a real problem when there is nobody over there to pay for them?                  You are worried about -- about armaments producers shipping -- shipping goods when there is nobody who has ordered them and is going to pay for them?        I mean, that's absurd.             Well, no.        I mean, it's also a debate as to whether the call on that question should be a Federal one or a State one, whether -- there are all sorts of conditions attached to the -- the suits that are allowed under 620A.             And you are saying that, even without those conditions, any State -- Oklahoma -- can decide Americans can -- can sue foreign countries.              I know, but we have been talking about it --              -- for a couple of minutes, so we --              I didn't start this. (Laughter.)             I think -- I think what they say is that the designation remains in effect.                 I don't think they say that the power to undesignate disappears.             I'd be -- well, I'll ask them, but I'd be surprised if it's --
07-1114 +++$+++               He was conceded that he was a drug user.              And that he was dangerous because he admitted the murders.              Do -- do you agree the prosecutor was arguing, when he said that he's a drug dealer, that he was not a drug user?                   Was it -- was it conceded that he was a drug user?               I suspect it was not. I said earlier it was, and it seems that it was not, because he introduced one witness to say that there were no -- no needle marks on his body, which would suggest that he's trying to make the point to the jury that this person doesn't even use drugs.
07-11191 +++$+++          They're trial witnesses. Anything else?         No, just one or two.    Just one or two affidavits.      Or it -- the court has a rule you have to provide those affidavits several weeks before trial.    That would be okay?         We'd have a whole European-type trial, right?           It would be trial by affidavit.        It does more than that.          It does more than that.     It is the prosecution that has had to place the witness on the stand.              It has not been up to the defense to say, oh, no, I object to this affidavit, I would like you to bring -- no.                 The prosecution has to bring in the witness.              That has been what the Confrontation Clause has meant.        No, you don't agree with that.     You say you don't have to do it unless the defendant objects and issue -- gets a subpoena issued.        How is that clear from the statute?        How is that clear from the statute?     It just says that a subpoena shall issue. What if a subpoena issues and nobody comes?        A strict construction of statutes in general, or a strict construction of this provision?        I'm talking about the specific issue of the person subpoenaed not appearing. Do you have a case?        So we don't really know.        I don't know how -- how strict construction gets you to the -- to the result that when it is the defendant who has to take the initiative to get the person brought in, if the person doesn't show up, it's -- it doesn't fall on the defendant; it falls on the prosecution.              I don't see how strict construction gets you there.           Well, the problem you describe, the hearsay rule would have solved that alone, wouldn't it?           So -- so what's left for the Confrontation Clause to do?         And it's still not clear -- not clear under the statute that if the witness doesn't show up, it's the prosecution that bears the burden.         Why is that clear?         It doesn't say what the consequence of his not appearing is.             That the -- that the written testimony is -- stands and is admitted, without the opportunity to cross-examine the witness?        No, the prosecutor issues the subpoena.        The witness does not show up.        I'm not talking about fault on the part of the prosecutor.            I'm talking about the fact that the witness has died, has fled the State, is simply not available.        Of course, he is required to appear.     But what happens if he doesn't appear?        No, we re not going in circles at all.    You -- you appeal to the language that the witness shall appear as resolving what happens when he doesn't, and it doesn't resolve that. It just says he must appear.             And if he doesn't appear, what happens?        Well, I don't see the statute requiring that.       It requires that of the witness, he shall appear.        How new is the new one?        Okay.      The -- the reply brief of -- of the Petitioners mentions that -- that the same thing, a spike occurred in other jurisdictions after Melendez-Diaz, but then the spike went down, after -- after 6 months or a short period.        What is peculiar about Virginia that -- or what is peculiar about Michigan or the other States that have this system and somehow are able to live with it?        Virginia criminals are nastier; is that it? (Laughter.)        Right.        That's not what we said in Melendez-Diaz, unfortunately.        We said the following More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses, not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses into court.    Its value to the defendant is not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence via ex parte affidavits and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants, if he chooses. So you are asking us to overrule that -- that statement?           He's present only if the defendant asks for him, right?           And that's exactly what this addressed.     It's not -- it's not replaced by a system in which the prosecution presents its evidence by -- and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants if he chooses.        That may be.       It's a perfectly reasonable argument.            I just object to your saying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz.        And it just doesn't -- doesn't apply just to analysts, right?          I mean, is there anything peculiar about analysts?          Would it not exist for any other witness?        Okay.        I don't understand what -- is that a yes or a no?        Okay.      So as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to other witnesses as well?        Indicia of reliability -- you want us to go back to that?            Is that -- (Laughter.)        Well, how many hundreds of cases will it take to identify those limits under that very clear Due Process Clause? (Laughter.)        Don't we want clear rules for the presentation?        Don't we want clear rules, not gambling on what the Supreme Court will say about due process?         Why -- why do we have to say anything in this case?         Why is this case here except as an opportunity to upset Melendez-Diaz?         This Virginia statute no longer exists, does it?      So we are pronouncing on the validity of a Virginia statute that is now gone, right?   They have adopted a statute that complies completely with Melendez-Diaz.        I'm not criticizing Virginia; I'm criticizing us for taking the case. (Laughter.)          That question of prior State law, right?
07-1122 +++$+++               Mr. Pincus, I want to go back to the previous subject for a minute.                    We certainly didn't take this case to decide whether the passenger was free to leave or not.           That -- that was not the issue on which we took the case.                And you claim that that issue has already been resolved by findings of the lower courts?              In order to contradict that, would we have to find that that's clearly erroneous?              I guess what about -- I -- I guess if we held that you could do this, this pat-down search here, it would probably carry forward to any other kind of seizure like a -- a roadblock to inspect for drunken driving or anything like that?              We would say the same thing:     That if there is a passenger in that car, you could tell the passenger to get out and conduct a pat-down search.             The "armed and dangerous" requirement, does the "dangerous" requirement mean endangering the policeman, or is it enough -- is it enough if -- if you think this fellow is -- you know, he's just a dangerous character.              Is that enough, or does it have to be an immediate threat to the policeman?              What do you think?              It's -- it's not enough if you think he's -- he's Al Capone?
07-1125 +++$+++               Yet the other side says that there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get into that.    Why can't we just send it back and let them figure that out?    And -- and -- and decide what we took this case to decide, namely, the split that now exists in the Federal courts over whether Title IX precludes the use of 1983.    That is an important question.                It's why we took the case.       Why can't we decide that issue and then for all these loose ends, send it back to the court of appeals?              He says there is an issue in controversy, that's good enough for me. (Laughter.)             That -- but that doesn't cover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't want to proceed under Title IX; I want to proceed first under 1983.    Then there is going to be no question about whether 1983 is -- is unavailable because of issue preclusion.    He is starting with 1983.             What is your position on that --             You can't proceed under 1983.             So you are disagreeing.
07-1209 +++$+++               Excuse me.       Why is that? I'm not sure I follow you on that point.                Once he's got up to the next level and finds what the notice should have told him, why can't he come up with it then?               You say it's a de novo, right, at this next level?
07-1216 +++$+++                Why didn't the trial judge just stop there?   I mean, if this is the ruling in the State --             -- once the trial judge found that one of the other instructions was bad, he could have just said, I throw the whole thing out.                    Why did he go to all the trouble of going into this, the governing one?             You -- you are acknowledging that the trial court did not apply the rule --              Mr. Peck, are you -- are you asserting that our remand order was in error?           After all, it did say, "We remand this case so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply this standard we have set forth."              If you say it's in error, my next question is going to be --              -- can -- is it up to a State court to sit in judgment about whether our remand orders are in error or not?              If that's what they took it to mean, they were just wrong.                I mean, that's not what it says.              The opinion concludes, "As the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional standard when considering Philip Morris's appeal."                  And it goes to the constitutional issue we are talking about.               "We remand so that the Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set forth," which has nothing to do with the issue we have been discussing this morning.               So it was wrong?               That's very nice, but that's not what we remanded for.
07-1223 +++$+++                How do you want us to dispose of the case that doesn't, that doesn't do that? What do you want us to do?               That's it?              Why shouldn't the district judge in light of the new evidence decide whether the judgment of the State court was -- would have been reasonable if it came out the same way, including this new evidence in the -- in the consideration?              Why shouldn't he do it that way.              I know it could.    But I'm asking whether it should.               Well, it seems to me the statute certainly contemplates that the States have the first --               -- the first cut at this thing, right?   How else do you give them the first cut?               So the Federal court is supposed to do what?               Okay.             Having established cause, he would then in your view not have the Federal court decide the matter de novo.           But the only question before the Federal court was whether there was in addition prejudice.             That is to say, whether -- but for the error, any reasonable factfinder would find by clear and convincing evidence that he was innocent --             -- right?              I guess the State court can say, you know, 60 days after the trial is -- is doomsday.    No more new evidence.              We are not going to consider anything new after that, even if you find Brady stuff or anything else.         Suppose that's unconstitutional -- but it isn't.                 I mean, is that unconstitutional?              Right.           So if it's not unconstitutional, then you just provide what you say, that the district court sees whether by clear and convincing evidence the case would have come out the other way. If it were unconstitutional, and I guess this is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw, anyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me there ought to be a way to make the State take the first cut at it.   Make the State say oh, yes, even with this new evidence we would still find this person guilty; and then in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the deference that 2254(d) requires.                You'd ask whether that was a reasonable determination.                 That's the fallacy in my -- in my reasoning.     Or you're saying I shouldn't be troubled by what has been troubling me, namely that he had no way to get this before the State court.                   They are entitled to close -- close the gates?
07-1239 +++$+++               I -- I didn't assert that they are -- that they are the same thing substantively. My -- my only question is whether your assertion of bad faith on -- on the part of the Navy holds water so long as they were doing an EA.          If -- you do an EA to see if an EIS is necessary.      And you say if there's no -- if there is no significant harm to the environment, you don't even need an EIS.                And that's how they started.   That's step one, and many agencies do that. They are authorized to do that.                I don't know why you have to attribute bad faith to the Navy simply because it began with an EA.              Excuse me.       That irreparable harm is the assessment of -- for purposes of the injunction -- refers to the same harm that is the harm which is the basis for standing, is it not?              -- procedural injury is not the kind of injury that gives rise to Article III standing.              The whole country can complain about the failure to issue an EIS.                  That is not the kind of injury that gives standing.
07-1309 +++$+++               Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.     I assume that he was responding to the argument that you can establish the enterprise from the mere existence of the pattern of the acts, from the separate acts.     And if indeed it takes nothing more than the acts to constitute the enterprise, it seems to me he has a point.              Oh, so we'll forget about your first one.              So --               What appendix?        Not the joint appendix?               All right.                 And -- and were they shown to the jury, all of those bank burglaries?                 So it is not at issue in this case whether -- whether the entity can be --                 -- derived simply from the predicate acts?             I am -- I am really confused now.    I don't -- I am not sure I know what your answer to the question presented is, which is quite simply must an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO have some ascertainable structure beyond that inherent in the commission of predicate crimes by its members and associates? And you -- your answer is no?             Yes.             Right.             Right, right.             Yes.             Yes, but you would have to tell the jury -- you would have to tell the jury you would have to find it.        Of course the jury can find it, but the issue is must the jury be told that it has to find it?   I think he's conceding --             Be told it's not enough, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for you to find that these predicate acts occurred; you must find -- and you can find it just from the predicate acts, if you think the evidence will justify that -- you must find an organization separate from the mere commission of the predicate acts.             I don't know. (Laughter.)                Right.
07-1315 +++$+++                  Is that precisely what we have to decide?     Or wouldn't it be whether it would be unreasonable for the State court not to come to that conclusion, which is one step removed?                 So -- so the usual test that the State court has to be affirmed unless it's unreasonable application of Supreme Court law is altered when the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing that the Federal habeas court believes should have been held?             How do you get that out of the statute?    I don't understand it; it makes no --             Right.             Right.              Excuse me.       What do you rely on for the proposition that if -- if you deny a hearing, all of the facts for which the hearing was demanded have to be assumed in favor of the party who asked for the hearing?               No, but that can't be. What if I deny the hearing because there are ample facts that show what the situation was, and a hearing would in my view be absolutely redundant?               And therefore all of the facts that support the other side have to be washed out simply because I've denied a hearing?               I wasn't addressing that. I was addressing the proposition that when you deny a hearing, all of the facts for which you demanded the hearing have to be assumed in your favor.               I -- it seems to be --              Twenty-five -- 25, 26, 27, 28, he has 25 years worth of discretion, doesn't he?              I didn't -- I didn't take that to mean under California law, since the jury found the one, it has to find the other.                 He wasn't making that argument.   He was saying any jury that found that this was done intentionally, that this was done, you know, with -- with planning, with -- with cover-up and what not, that jury is not going to find that he was crazy.   That's all he was saying, and -- and that seems to me entirely reasonable.

07-1372 +++$+++               Why doesn't the Hawaii Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish that there is some property right on the part of these native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with Federal law?              I don't care what you call it; it's a property interest.               As I read the Federal law, it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii.                 Now if you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now finding as a matter of State law that there is a property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians -- I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever -- it seems to me that is flat contradiction of Federal law, and probably is an issue that we ought to address in this opinion.              They do nothing at all? Could I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence pro curiam, where we just say to the extent that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as creating any -- any property entitlement in the Hawaiians, it was in error.            Okay, we send it back to the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Hawaii Supreme Court smiles, and doesn't do a blessed thing.                 Leaves -- leaves the injunction against any distribution of the land in effect.   What -- what happens then?             You don't?             Not if we said "to the extent that."   I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates property rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do something.             To the extent that it may be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's grounded on that or not --                Is the court the trustee?                The State is the trustee. So I assume it would be up to the State officers to decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians, among the five obligations, should be given precedence. Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State officers to give it precedence?              And saying that the trustee must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five ends.              And all this comes from the fact that Congress made reference to and approved a so-called reconciliation process?                 So in -- in perpetuam, this land can't be transferred because Congress approved the this reconciliation process?                 I see.                 Or denying it to them?              I don't quite understand. You mean -- you mean a Federal court can enjoin the sale of my house, and there is nothing I can do about it inasmuch as I do not have any present intention of selling my house --              -- except to live under that injunction.              You -- you say there is no controversy, so I -- I cannot get its validity adjudicated, right?             I don't think that -- I don't think that the State has to have an immediate intention to sell any particular piece of land in order to object to an injunction against any sale of land by the State in the future.          I -- I don't think it has to wait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.             But there is.          The State says that I am free to sell the land, and -- and the Court says, no, you are not.             Isn't that a dispute?             Mr. Shanmugam, you -- you didn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition the -- the question of mootness.               Well, you don't have to preserve it.   I mean it's -- it's an issue of Article III jurisdiction, so we would have to look into it on our -- on our own.      But it does suggest that it is not a very strong string to your bow, if I may put it that way.
07-1410 +++$+++               I don't understand your answer.   If you say that those were not relevant and, therefore, they were not covered --              In the Rehabilitation Act, the requirements for approval of lease, is -- is that applicable to mineral leases?               Yes.              What do you do about the fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be permitted under the Rehabilitation Act?               Which is all that the Rehabilitation Act -- I'm sorry.               Expired --               Mr. Phillips, the government says that by the time this lease was executed, the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter. That it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the Navajo reservation, and there were funds appropriated for that purpose and that all had been played out by the time this lease was entered into. Is there something wrong with that?              You bring in Federal officials to testify years after the fact as to what basis they acted earlier?          That's very strange to me.             I don't know what -- what motive Secretary Udall has today that might induce him to say that.              If there was some statement at the time, I could understand it, but bringing him in how many years after -- 40 years after?              What did Secretary Udall think about this?
07-1428 +++$+++                  I don't see how you can call it facially neutral.            It's neutral because you throw it out for the losers as well as for the winners? That's neutrality?             Of course you're not saying that -- that the test is -- is compliance.                  You're -- you're saying the belief that it's necessary for compliance is a compelling State interest.             I mean everybody would probably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly be in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest. But the issue here is:       Is it enough if the employer simply worries that if he doesn't make the change, he may be in violation?             What -- what's the line there?             You acknowledge strong basis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to have?             Right.              I thought you just said that.   I just thought you just -- I was -- almost wrote it down. (Laughter.)              Absolutely positively? (Laughter.)

07-1529 +++$+++               Excuse me.           I think it's -- I think it's wrong.      I think it's common ground that so long as he says, even though I have a lawyer, I'll talk to you, that's okay.              And that's not okay in civil cases, but it's perfectly okay here.              Ms. Landry, I don't really understand what you're arguing here.                      I thought you were saying there has to be a request in your response to Justice Souter, but then you accept as sufficient his merely saying thank you.           That's not a request.              That's what I thought, too. But you were saying there had to be a request.                      You abandon that?     There doesn't have to be a request?              "Thank you" is not a request.              Well, I don't -- I don't -- I agree with Justice Souter.            I -- acceptance is something different from a request.                     As I read the -- the State court's opinion, it was setting up a sort of offer and acceptance scenario.              The State was offering him counsel, said, "I appoint counsel," but it was ineffective until he says yes, "I accept counsel," whereupon, you know, he's lawyered up, but he isn't lawyered up until he says "I accept," and that's something quite different from -- from requesting counsel.              Now, are you -- are you standing on the -- on the State court's analysis or not?              Of course, the usual legal rule is that silence implies consent, right?               Read the prosecution of Thomas More.            That's the legal rule.     So why shouldn't we assume consent just from the fact that he stood silent?
07-1601 +++$+++                Excuse me.       You say in the process of delivery.      I thought that this material became the property of the buyer when the truck arrived. Are you saying it only -- it only became the property of the buyer when it was unloaded from the truck?               What does "FOB" normally mean?                 I think -- I think it's something of a misdescription to say that this spillage is occurring in the course of delivery.                 I think as far as Shell was concerned, delivery had been made when the truck pulled up.                 You're making it.                 Excuse me.              You mean it could have -- could have adopted some other means?              That's all you mean by having control over it.              All right.       So all you're requiring is knowledge that using this means will -- will result in a spill.        I don't think knowledge alone is enough for -- I think you need purpose.                If you arrange for disposal, I think you have to have a purpose.   It -- it has to be your object to have the oil leaking along the highway as you go.                    Merely knowing that it's going to be leaking, I mean, there may be some other way under the statute that you can find liability on the part of the shipper, but not, it seems to me, on the -- on the ground that the shipper arranged for this leak.   He didn't want the leak.             He knew it was happening, but that was not the object of the transport.              All right.                 Is that a finding?      Do we have to take it as a given that this was an indivisible harm?
07-208 +++$+++                 When you say they have their choice, you meant they have the choice of elevating the standard that applies to the competency to stand trial if they wish?              Are there any psychiatric studies that show how accurate psychiatric studies are? (Laughter.)              That -- that estimate, for example, how accurately one can predict whether a particular defendant will indeed be able to defend himself?              I didn't think so.               You don't just have a record in open court.        You have the experience of a trial in the past.               That's more than just the stuff that was on the record.               You've had the experience of a trial.               Why do you concede that if the trial is not disruptive, the mere fact that this fellow is making an incompetent defense or, indeed, may be making no sense is justification for terminating the trial?   I mean, this person can plead guilty if he wishes and that's perfectly okay.                 Can he not take the lesser step of putting forward an incompetent defense? The State is still going to have to plead -- to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before the case goes to the jury that he committed the crime that he's accused of, beyond a reasonable doubt.                   And I don't know why the mere fact that his defense is incompetent or even is making no sense would justify -- if that's what he wants to do instead of pleading guilty, that's, it seems to me, what the right of an individual consists of.              Right.              Your position is it has to be disruptive.    If it's not disruptive, even if he's making no sense, that's his choice, right?              Except, as you say, we don't know whether he was on his medication or not.
07-21 +++$+++                 And why, why can't the people injured by this law appear themselves and say the law can't be applied to us?              You seem to accept that a facial challenge is appropriate here.                     Why is -- some different kind of a facial challenge.                     I thought in the usual facial challenge you have to show that there is no situation in which the law cannot be constitutionally applied.                Then why are we arguing about whether there is one half of one percent of the electorate who may be adversely affected and as to whom it might be unconstitutional?               That one half of one percent, if and when it is sought to be applied to them, have a cause of action to say you can't apply it to me. But why -- what precedent is there for knocking down this entire law on a facial challenge when I think everybody agrees that in the vast majority of cases it doesn't impose a significant hardship?               Does that scare you, Mr. Fisher, that there can't be a facial challenge?               I mean, every facial challenge is an immense dictum on the part of this Court, isn't it?               This Court is sitting back and looking at the ceiling and saying, oh, we can envision not the case before us, but other cases.                     Maybe it's one half of one percent or maybe it's 45 percent, who knows.   But we can imagine cases in which this law could be unconstitutional, and therefore, the whole law is unconstitutional.      That's not ordinarily the way courts behave, is it?             Now, we've done that in the First Amendment area.             Suppose you -- you have your photograph taken when you register.                You're really an out of state person, you go in and register, you make up an address, you come in, you have your photograph taken; it proves that you were the person that registers.   It doesn't prove that you were the person that lives at that address, or that you are of such and such an age and whatnot, which the -- the means of identification that you require would show, wouldn't it?              You can't, can you?              The national policy it to make it both easy to register and easy to vote.              And for nonindigent people. I mean, there may be --              Some very well-to-do elderly, you don't drive, and they are in the same position.              Don't you need a birth certificate to get a passport?              Yes.      So maybe that's unconstitutional too. (Laughter.)                The provisional ballots would be counted, I assume.                The provisional ballots would be counted.    The ones that were unconstitutionally prevented from voting -- those claims would be counted.                Things called class actions, right?
07-210 +++$+++                 Wait.                Why couldn't you show -- why couldn't -- that's like the situation where a company runs a -- runs a lottery and in fact misrepresents what the odds are.                 And then you mean the people can't recover because they couldn't show that they would have won?        It seems to me you can calculate the difference in the odds or something and place some value on that.    Is it really painless to say, you know, I'm running a lottery and your chances of winning are one in a thousand, and everybody buys a ticket on that basis, and it turns out that really your chances are one in a million?    Nobody has a cause of action because nobody can prove he would have won?                That's all they can get? Just what they paid for the ticket?
07-214 +++$+++              I have another question. Suppose the subcontractor -- the fraud consists of inflating the hours spent in a cost-plus contract.                   So the subcontractor submits and receives payment for $10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved.                  All right? But that all comes out of the hide of the contractor.    The contractor gets the same amount of money from the Federal Government and the fraud only harms the contractor.             That would not be --                 Why?               A hundred dollars more a can. (Laughter.)             He has to know that.      He has to know that his bill is going to be sent up the line to the government.        "Knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record to get a false or fraudulent --             And if he knows it, serve him right.   But this other guy thinks he's just honestly cheating the guy who's buying the chemicals. (Laughter.)             It doesn't shock me.      I don't know.    It doesn't shock me at all.               If indeed the object of this is to prevent fraud upon the government and if the government has not been deceived at all, get yourself a new statute.             This statute doesn't have to cover every ill in the world.               But if injuring the Federal Government would -- it would suffice to injure the Federal Government that the schools are shoddy and the roofs are leaking?      That would be enough?               Even though the Federal Government is not out of pocket any more, but the program that it -- that it was desirous of encouraging is simply not as good as it would have been otherwise.              I thought --              I thought it was not established that anything from this defendant got to the Navy.              Well, where in the record is there some indication that some -- some paper from -- with a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?              Well, I know what certificates are, I mean, you know, their general content.   But was there anything in the record that a certificate from Allison went to the Navy with Allison's signature on it?              Well, then there's less to this case than we had thought.                My goodness, even under the Petitioner's theory, you win.                  If indeed a fraudulent document was given to Bath and Bath passed that on, I think the Petitioners would have conceded --             -- that there's a cause of action.    What is all this fuss about, then?             I wish you had said that in your brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot of reading. (Laughter.)               And whose -- whose contract required this?   It's a strange provision to be in the contract between Allison and Bath.               And that contract between Allison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison had to be presented to the Navy?              And Bath would have been in breach of its contract with Allison unless it passed these things on to the Navy?             That's why I say it's a strange provision to be in the contract between Bath and Allison.              Allison could sue Bath for not passing the certificate on to the Navy?             Did you make this point in response to the petition for cert?             Well, you know, usually we take a case to decide the question presented; and if this question is really not before us you should have told us that.
07-219 +++$+++                  In respect, I mean, the janitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation. I mean, surely, that can't be the test.             I assume the test is the person has to be high enough that it justifies holding the entire corporation.         And I doubt whether a captain is -- is high enough.       How many of these units does Exxon have?             Twenty vessels.                I thought the Lake Shore -- well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it is principle was that a captain ain't one of those.                     The captain doesn't -- doesn't do the job.               That, and $3.5 billion. (Laughter.)               What about -- what about looking to the Clean Water Act?               And I wanted to ask you this question about the Act.             Assuming we agree with you that -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water Act as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why was it too late in the appellate court to raise the Clean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law should not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and, in part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages of the amount at issue here should not be allowed? It seems to me there it's not a new argument.    It's just an additional factor for arguments that have already been made.               Yes.      That's part 3.   What about part 2?   Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the argument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the court of appeals?     Okay, we agree that the Clean Water Act does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages here, but one of the factors that we ought to take into account in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this situation permits punitive damages is the existence of the Clean Water Act.       That's not a pre-emption thing. Is that also waived, do you think?               They don't have to make every tiny little argument.             I mean, you can think of additional points on appeal so long as it's under the same major heading.      And the major heading here is not the Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the major heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not permit.   And, you know, they had made other arguments about prior cases; they had talked about State law; and this is just another argument:                By the way, here's another one.   There's the Clean Water Act.                 It's close.                 But it doesn't really say pre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to consider when you decide what the evolving law of admiralty requires.
07-290 +++$+++               Wasn't -- wasn't it the case that the banning of arms on the part of the Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used the term, forbade them to "bear arms"?                   It didn't mean that could just not join militias; it meant they couldn't carry arms.                The freedom of speech that was referred to in the Constitution was also "the" freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing And there were indeed some freedom of speech. restrictions on that such as libel that you were not And yet we've never held that simply allowed to do. because it was pre-existing and that there were some regulations upon it, that we would not use strict scrutiny.   We certainly apply it to freedom of speech, don't we?                Like libel.              I don't understand that. What would that be -- that you can, if you have time, when you hear somebody crawling in your -- your bedroom window, you can run to your gun, unlock it, load it and then fire?    Is that going to be the exception?              But that opinion also, it didn't use the militia prologue to say it's only the kind of weapons that would be useful in militia, and that are commonly -- commonly held today.                    Is there any Federal exclusion of weapons that applies to weapons that are commonly held today?             I don't know what you're worried about.   Machine guns, what else?                   Armored bullets, what else?  mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of Once it's an arm in the specialized sense that arms. the opinion referred to it, which is -- which is the type of a weapon that was used in militia, and it is -- it is nowadays commonly held.                If you read it that way, I don't see why you have a problem.                 Talk a little slower; I'm not following you.              You want to say yes.              That's your answer.              Which shows that maybe you're being unrealistic in thinking that the second clause is not broader than the first.                    It's not at all uncommon for a legislative provision or a constitutional provision to go further than is necessary for the principal purpose involved. The principal purpose here is the militia, but the -- but the second clause goes beyond the militia and says the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Now, you may say the kind of arms is colored by the militia.   But it speaks of the right of the people.   So why not acknowledge that it's -- it's broader than the first clause?              You don't even agree that Massachusetts was subject to the Second Amendment.              But the time we're talking about, the firearms in the home ordinance, when was that?              It's useful for such purposes as what "keep and bear arms" means and things of that sort.              They certainly didn't want to preserve the kind of militia that America had, which was a militia separate from the state, separate from the government, which enabled the revolt against the British.              You wouldn't put it that way.   You would just say it is not being infringed if reasonable limitations are placed upon it.              All the more reason to allow a homeowner to have a handgun.
07-308 +++$+++              I'm not certain it was valid if this coal was not shipped overseas.               You're putting an awful burden on the government to know when the coal is severed and shipped.               You're saying if they mistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather than for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis whatever for the tax claim.            I'm not sure I agree with.                Why is the Export Clause so, so significant?      The only other self-executing constitutional clause that provides for damages automatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause. And we have allowed the states to require claimants to jump through innumerable hoops.               They have to exhaust all their administrative remedies before they can bring a suit here.   Why -- why is the Export Clause any -- any more sacrosanct?              Volenti non fit injuria. If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person has no claim until he complies with the administrative procedures that render that tax unconstitutional.            But up until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it seems to me there is no constitutional violation.             I'm not saying it has to be made at the moment they pay their taxes.                 I'm just saying until it's made there is no unconstitutional, unconstitutional export tax.
07-312 +++$+++               Because you don't know whether that second one will ever be a sale under a plan, which is what the code requires.                  It has to be a transfer under a plan.       And when it occurs, you don't know whether it is going to be an under plan or not.              At the time it occurs it doesn't matter how you define the term.                  There is no way at the time it occurs to say that this is a transfer under a plan.   There hasn't been a confirmed plan.              It requires under a plan confirmed.              It says "a plan confirmed." How do you know at the time the transfer is made whether it is under a plan confirmed?              You don't at all know.                 You would have no reason to know the answer to that question.                  You are not the State. The State has told us that millions of dollars have been lost in taxes not recovered.               You missed the crucial -- the crucial part.     The transfer has to be under a plan confirmed.    I mean, that's the troublesome language. The transfer has to be under a plan confirmed.              What is the section you mentioned earlier that uses "under" in a sense that clearly applies to pre-confirmation?              I'm looking for it, and I can't --              Did you make that argument there?              How does that provision read?    Do you have it quoted here?              It's always escrowed?       Is that --               Is that a uniform practice?              Could I?              You know, we've said in other opinions no -- no statute pursues its purposes at all costs.   And the limitations contained in a statute are as much a part of its purpose as the broad purpose that you just mentioned.           I mean, if a -- if a "plan confirmed" means a plan confirmed, that limitation is part of the purpose no less than the broad purpose that you express.              Maybe, but "under a plan confirmed" seems under normal interpretation of language to me to mean under a plan that has been confirmed.

That just means he is willing to accept the penalty in the next election even if this case doesn't come out in his favor.             It doesn't prove that it isn't a penalty.              You think that's really a proper function of government, to look out over there and say, we're going to even the playing field in this election?   What if some -- one candidate is more eloquent than the other one?            You make him talk with pebbles in his mouth or what? (Laughter.)             But the campaign finance regimes we've approved up to now, the significant limitations, have had an anti-corruption rationale. There is no anti-corruption rationale here.                 The only purpose of this is to level the playing field.                 And I am deeply suspicious of allowing elections to be conducted under a regime whereby Congress levels the playing field.    That seems to be very dangerous.               I thought that that's what a facial challenge essentially consists of.                      You don't look to see whether in fact the harmful First Amendment effect has occurred; you look to whether it opens up the possibility for that to occur.               You can't go in before the election and say:     Look, I'm about to be terribly disadvantaged; my opponent is about to have all of these coordinated expenses and I'm not able to.                 And you're going to say:   Oh, we have to wait until the election is over to see whether in fact that happens.                 It seems to me this is precisely the kind of a situation a facial challenge is designed for.                What if one party has more time on his hands?      He's -- he's unemployed, so he -- you know, he can go around, whereas the other party has to -- has to hire people to speak for him.                      He has -- he has a job most of the time.             Are you going to even that disparity, too?             I can understand leveling, leveling contribution limits when you're worried about corruption, I can understand that.                  But doing it just to -- to make sure that there is an even playing field, I -- there's just no end to that.               And it just isn't money that makes it an even playing feed.                      A lot of other factors -- incumbency, the war chest that incumbents have which -- money from the last election, that isn't counted for -- for the millionaires' provision. There are so many factors that -- that go to making the even playing field that I -- I'm just very reluctant to acknowledge a congressional power to -- to sit in judgment of our elections that way.             But --             That's the price of accepting the government subsidy.               They're -- nobody is accepting a government subsidy here.                   The man is spending his own money --             -- for a speech.             On the theory that it doesn't make much sense anyway?             Is that why --             -- we can chop it up this way?             Suppose we found -- we were of the view that all of the provisions, that the benefits given to the other side here are bad.                 I suppose we could even -- re-even the playing field by either denying those benefits to the candidate opposing the Appellant, the Petitioner here, or we could do the opposite and eliminate similar restrictions upon -- upon the Petitioner.   Do you have any idea which way we ought to go?
07-330 +++$+++               Me, too. (Laughter.)              Could we discuss -- let's leave aside for the moment what the background rule of law is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first point -- whether this particular statute proscribes the answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further. Why do you say it proscribes the answer?              Well, why would -- why would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1) than for (f)(2)?   It's clear under (f)(2) if the sentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the -- or if the departure is based on an impermissible factor or is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable guideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other party, the court doesn't get into it. Why would it want a different rule for those two?   In other words, I'm saying that far from supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a) and (a) seems to me harms your case.  the defendant has appealed.  the government has appealed. That's right.  government has appealed, you don't get any relief under -- under --                Of course, that difference disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing assumes that the factor complained of has been brought to the court's attention by the proper person.               So that (f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in violation of law because the defendant was given too little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in violation of law that he was given too much, it makes much more sense that way, it seems to me.                But it's not enough to say, well, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, in looking at the proper appeal by the proper -- my goodness, look what we've noticed. It's not that.           You're saying the court of appeals has to search the record.                 It has to make sure that there were no errors in favor -- or harming the other party who has not cross-appealed. And that's a considerable burden, as Judge Boudin's opinion on the court of appeals makes clear.              And it's extraordinary.              Precisely so.              Which is why we have tried to pare down what is jurisdictional.              This argument is not an argument under the statute?              This is an argument giving your interpretation of what the background rule is?              And you would limit the background rule to plain error?              So that it was a violation of law?               What do we mean by the "sentencing packaging rule"?              Getting what he deserves, right?
07-343 +++$+++               Just the way they used to.              Ms. Clark, what do you do with the requirement that our cases have imposed?               It is not a requirement I agree with, but it is certainly one our cases have imposed, that you cannot leave -- leave it to the jury whether to impose the death penalty or not even for murder, but rather you have to narrow the class of people who have committed that particular crime so that -- so that the imposition won't be random. Although later, we say you have to let the jury consider any mitigating factory which makes it random; but nonetheless, our cases do say you have to narrow the class of murderers who can be given the death penalty. Wouldn't the same apply to the class of child rapists?              Why not.              You think intentional murder of a -- of a law officer would need no further narrowing?              Do you?         Do you really?              Didn't the -- didn't the Louisiana statute that -- that was at issue in Lowenfield produce the result that if you committed intentional murder of a law enforcement officer, it was up to the jury whether to give you the death penalty or not?              Would not the same result be -- be achieved by a statute that said if you intentionally kill a law enforcement officer, you are subject to the death penalty?              Wouldn't it be precisely the same degree of narrowing?              It was not all child rape.              It was not all child rape. It was only children up to the age of 11.
07-371 +++$+++               If he -- if he was his agent -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of inquiry -- suppose in the second case Herrick tells him I want you to bring a suit on my behalf.                       He says fine, I'll do that.    He brings that suit.                     And then Taylor says, you know, I also want to bring a suit on my own. And he brings another suit, not as agent for Herrick. I suppose he could do that, couldn't he? The first would be thrown out because it's Herrick's second suit.    But the -- Taylor's own suit would remain Taylor's own suit, wouldn't it?               So long as there's no more collusion or anything else, he's --               I hope so.              That's a -- it's a standard privity case.   It is privity in reverse.                   I suppose a subsequent owner of real estate is in privity with, and therefore, bound by a judgment concerning the real estate rendered against the prior owner. But it's probably also true that when there's a suit by a later owner, the prior owner cannot then bring in court a claim based upon the same -- the same matters that the subsequent owner relied on.              It's up privity instead of down privity.   Wouldn't that --              Counsel, you have described for us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your proposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow. You're going to solve just the case of, you know, two people building an airplane.                   You agree, anybody else in the association can file a lawsuit. Anybody else in the United States can file a lawsuit, even if they're not in the association. It seems to me that, you know, in order to cut off an eyebrow, I'm not willing to make a whole lot of incursion upon our traditional rules of who's bound by a lawsuit.              Why should we stretch for that?              No.              It is sort of a totality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right.              We look at the whole thing, and we say, you know, close enough relationship.                     It is not close enough; close enough.               You need a better rule than that for something that, you know, is a threshold issue in a case.              That's just as bad.         You're absolutely right.     That's just as bad.              What -- what the opinion said is to review the bidding.               There is record evidence that:   One, Taylor and Herrick had identical interests; two, Taylor's interest was adequately represented in Herrick; three, Herrick and Taylor had a close working relationship relative to these successive cases. And that's enough.             That's enough to show collusion.
07-411 +++$+++                Wait.      They are, they are not objecting to a -- to a general verdict.                 They are objecting to the fact that in their view, one of the elements of that -- of that general verdict is based upon what they assert is an invalid claim in the -- in the Indian court.                I don't know that they waive that when they when -- when they allow a general verdict to go.                If evidence supports any one of the claims contained in the general rule.                 The tribal court of appeals would have to be finding Federal law.                     It wouldn't be Indian law; it would be Federal law.                 You say they have adopted the Federal rules.      So whatever the Federal law -- in other words, we would ask them to answer the question that you don't want us to answer.              Certainly, your reliance upon the Federal rules doesn't impress me as much as it did when you first told me about it, because apparently the Federal rules mean whatever the tribal courts say they mean; is that right?              And come to its own decision as to what they mean.              And do we get special loan guarantees? (Laughter.)              Well, it has to be a known -- a known consensual relationship, for one thing. Wouldn't you add that requirement. Yes.              He backed off on that.      I pressed the point and -- (Laughter.)              Well, that may be; it depends on what you mean by "tribal."                    I mean, it certainly would be rational to say that all disputes between members of the tribe can be resolved authoritatively by the tribal court, but it's quite a different thing to say that a dispute between a nonmember of the tribe and a member of the tribe can go to the tribal court.       It's sort of the analogue to being home fried in a foreign State.               It's -- is pretty close.              Defendant, yes.              You would add on the reservation?    I mean --              If he walks into some town in South Dakota, the mere fact that you know he's an Indian -- it has to be on the reservation.               Am I correct that the collateral here, the land, the land that was collateral was within the reservation but it was not Indian land.              And you think that that's enough.   It doesn't have to -- when you say "on the reservation," you include as on the reservation land that is no longer owned by Indians but -- but is within the reservation boundaries.              No, no, wait.       You say that consensual relationship is not enough.                    If you enter into relationship with Indian in South Dakota on, you know -- in the State capital, that isn't enough.                    It has to be on the reservation.            You acknowledge that.          And for purposes of on the reservation, it's enough that you're dealing with land that is within the reservation even -- even if it is no longer Indian land?
07-440 +++$+++                What authority do you have to hold somebody who's not been charged?                 I mean I don't understand that.   You say he hasn't been charged, but we're going to hold you in jail.                That's very strange.             No counsel right would attach? No counsel right would attach?             I think it's a problem even if you appoint counsel.        You say you can keep people without charging them so long as you give them counsel?              Mr. Coleman, what happens in other jurisdictions?          I probably ought to know this, but I don't.    Maybe you do.            When you don't have a procedure called magistration, but someone is taken before a magistrate and with the prosecutor present, is the indictment at that point drawn up, or doesn't the -- doesn't the prosecutor have some time to decide what the indictment ought to contain?              What -- what happens at that point?              So what happens in the interim?   Is he -- is he charged in the interim, or is he just held because he is going to be charged, which is what's going on here.
07-455 +++$+++               You're saying it should have said "during which"?              "During the commission of which the explosive was used or carried"?              Including the policeman who had cartridges in his gun, presumably, right?              You could say it is not a question on which we grant certiorari.               Yes, you got it anyway.              Could I ask you about the "in which," the "in which" thing?               It has just occurred to me that "in which" is in a very sloppy clause anyway, because it says "shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment, including that imposed for the felony in which the explosive was used or carried." What about the fire?              It omits fire entirely -- in which fire or the explosive.                Fire or the explosive was used or the explosive was carried.                It's a pretty sloppy job down at the end of (h), isn't it? So I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight on the "in which" given that the rest of it is so sloppy.              If you are being very precise, but whoever wrote that was, obviously, not being very precise because he left out "fire" entirely.
07-463 +++$+++                What if there -- what if there was not a regulation on this subject, but the agency, by its constant practice, applies a certain procedure in all of these cases, would you have it              -- the power in the abstract to challenge the agency's consistent application of a certain procedure? You could certainly do it in a particular case, if the agency did something that was unlawful, you could certainly challenge it?            But let's assume you don't have a particular case, you just object to the fact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this thing that is wrong. Will you have standing to challenge that?              You would have standing?              Your complaint is I don't like the way the agency behaves?             Why do you make a difference with respect to the regulation?                   Why does the mere fact that this agency lawlessness happens to be reflected in a regulation, why does that suddenly alter the standing calculation?          You either have been harmed or you haven't been harmed.              Is that all it says?           No, I think it speaks of categories across the board that affect   -- that immediately, concretely affect the person complaining of the regulation, which is the case in these areas where you have a regulation requiring drug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal penalty to print certain things on labels.                 That immediately affects them. I think that is what footnote 2 is about, not about -- not about any regulation that is across the board.   That wouldn't make any sense. Where is footnote 2.               Let's read it. (Laughter.)             You need a permit to have a Christmas tree?    Where is this? (Laughter.)             I know what you're talking about.             That's not unusual.     I mean, standing looks not just to harm that has already been suffered but to harm that is imminent.                And if these people are regular bidders and they say, you know, I'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine. But these people are -- you don't know any specific project.   They are just people interested in forests throughout the United States.             That's quite different from saying, "I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to me."   I don't see anything -- you know, anything except in the case that was settled that has that kind of a connection.                 Tell me the two cases again that you are relying on for this.                 And what's that?         What's the cite for it?              Can I ask you about Northeastern Florida?     I have dug that out.               I don't think it -- it supports what you say.                  In its complaint what was going on here is that there was a -- a minority business preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville, and some contractors who were not minorities sued saying that this was in -- in violation of the Constitution. And what happened -- what the Court said about standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged that many of its members regularly bid on and perform construction works.     Now, if it had stopped there it might fit your case, but then it went on to say, "and that they would have bid on designated set-aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed." As I read the case there were designated contracts, of which they said we would have bid on them but we didn't because of this -- what the case involved was the assertion by the city that you don't have standing unless you can show you would have been awarded the contract.   And we said, no, no, you don't have to be awarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have been a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's enough for standing. So that's not this case.
07-474 +++$+++               Why -- but we have said that -- that there is a constitutional claim if the reason the person was not hired is that the person did not belong to the political party that the -- that the hiring person belonged to, the current administration.              You said you can't turn down somebody just because she's a Democrat or a Republican.             But as far as the Federal law claim is concerned, you'd urge us to come out the same way, even if this case came up before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, right?             But as to Federal employment, you'd say the same?             And you'd say the same as if there were no State remedies for --             -- employment discrimination by the State.              Because the State has a right to employ at will?             Why can't you simply say that they are not being denied equal protection of the law?    The law that applies to her and to everybody else employed by the government is that the employment is at will?             That's certainly an equal protection.    She could be fired at will and everybody else can be fired at will.             Why isn't that equal protection of the law?                It doesn't talk about equal protection, actually, it talks about equal protection the law; and if -- if the law in the government employment context is that you can be dismissed at will, or for a number of reasons, so long as everybody is subject to that same law, it would seem to be no discrimination in the law?             Oh, don't rely on the text, certainly. (Laughter.)
07-499 +++$+++                  Mr. Katsas, can I bring you back to Aristotle? (Laughter.)                 Thank you.       This is not a criminal statute.                 The government is not imposing punishment upon this person --                 -- for some malfeasance. Rather, it's -- it's giving a grant of a great benefit --             -- to a class of people. And your position is that it has narrowed that class, perhaps now more than was necessary, but that the government thought that, rather than letting in and giving asylum to the commandant of Trebenko, it would be better to have a provision that simply excludes those who, under coercion or not, persecuted others.                  Isn't that --             Did Aristotle say anything about that?    Limiting --             Limiting the nation's generosity on the basis of a provision that may or may not have anything to do with blame?                That's very helpful. (Laughter.)                You -- can I get from you an answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus?                 Do you -- does the Government deny even the necessity of knowledge that what you are doing is assisting in the persecution of somebody?           You don't even have to know that you are assisting in the persecution?                Good for them.   I mean, that is really an extreme position.
07-512 +++$+++              Would that lie here first? I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think that the regulatory agency would be acting properly if it prescribed a price that was predatory or allowed the charge of a price that was predatory, would you?                 They wouldn't permit it. Then is there -- is there no such thing as primary agency responsibility to take care of that problem rather than rushing into a court and take care of it through the -- through the Sherman Act?                 Well, they are dealing with the problem there.      They are decreeing the price that could be charged, aren't they?                Don't they have to approve the pricing?
07-513 +++$+++                 They -- they won't know that they are going to lose a case.                      What they will know is that if they happen to arrest someone whom they should not have arrested anyway, they won't be able to prosecute him, right?                So they are saving themselves nothing.      I mean, this person would not have been stopped.    I mean, if the difference was we -- we caught a criminal and we could have convicted him except because of the clerical error we can't, but that's not the situation.    They would never have found this fellow but for the clerical error.             You would allow all of that inquiry every time there's a motion to exclude.                       That would not just be the basis for 1983.                   You still want negligence inquiry.             Thank you.         That's a little different.             Mr. Dreeben, if we adopt your formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count, is it clear that that's all there was in this case?
07-526 +++$+++               Where -- where was this interesting conversation?           Was it even on the floor of the Congress?    It couldn't have been, because one of the members wasn't a Congressman, right?              It was at a hearing, oh.              He can include anybody else?    He can include, for example, people who are only one quarter-Indian blood, even though, you know, they went to the trouble of defining it as 50 percent Indian blood?               Very strange statute, just leaving it up to him to do whatever he wants.               So -- so there is no limitations.   It includes this and it also includes whatever else he wants.        Is that it?               That's -- that's a very strange reading of "shall include" when you're dealing with a word that does not itself have any solid content. When you're dealing with a word that's pretty much self-defining, yes, you can say "shall include this," because what in addition is included is -- is pretty clear. But these words have virtually no -- no content; and if you say "shall include" means, you know, it has this, I'm still left with well, what else does it have?    I can't believe that the statute was meant to be that expansive, to let the Secretary buy land for whomever he wanted.                It's pretty clear what the Court thought it meant, though, isn't it?                 Whether it's dictum or not, it's pretty clear that the Court thought it clearly enough meant that, that they were willing to say bracket -- you know.                I agree.                I agree.                It suggests that it's not very ambiguous, I think.              I'm interested -- I'm interested in the Secretary's conclusion that recognized "tribe" and "tribe now under Federal jurisdiction" are one and the same; that the words are used redundantly. Does he know the rule that we usually don't -- I guess he doesn't because he interprets "now" to mean nothing.   Does he understand that we usually do not interpret words to have no meaning?                     Why would they say both if they both mean the same thing?              "Recognized tribe under Federal jurisdiction," that, to me, means two different requirements.             I don't -- I don't understand how you say that -- that the term "tribe" has no limitation to Indians.           "The term 'tribe,' whenever used in this Act, shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band or Pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation."              Well, it's -- I mean circular definitions are nothing unusual in the legislation that Congress comes up with.              What meaning -- what meaning do you think the sentence has when it says: "The term 'tribe' shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band, Pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation"?              How can you interpret that not to be limited to Indian tribes?
07-542 +++$+++              What -- if -- if we don't apply the officer safety rationale to searches of the person, no matter how elderly, how eminent, how virtuous the person is, you can frisk.              We're obviously not applying the officer safety rule across the board. We're adopting a bright-line rule that obviously applies to many situations in which the officer is not at risk. Why can't you do the same for automobiles?                What's -- what's the history there?    Do you know the history there.                Yes, Thomas Jefferson's conveyance --              There is not much there.              There is not much there.
07-543 +++$+++                 Yes, but I thought the question was whether it was unlawful at the time, before the later statute.                And -- and you say that, even though discriminating against pregnancy leave was itself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you credit for the time of that pregnancy leave was unlawful?                And you say Gilbert had nothing to do with it?             Go on, finish.   I --             I don't understand why you say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory now.   You contend that right now it's facially discriminatory.             It seems to me what the retirement plan says is that there is deducted from your seniority, for purposes of calculating what you get under the plan, all periods in which you -- you were lawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the company.   Now, that doesn't seem to be facially discriminatory at all.               No, but it didn't.       Not -- not during the period for which it is used in -- in the retirement system.               After the new legislation was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority. But -- but during the period before that occurred, it was not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was lawfully not counted towards seniority. So what you have is a retirement plan that says all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work are -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited to the -- to the employees.              I don't see how that is facially discriminatory.              Is -- is there a difference between "facially discriminatory" and "discriminatory impact"?   I mean I can see how you could say it has a discriminatory impact, but to say that on its face, when all it says is that you are credited with all of the periods in which you were lawfully working for the company and you are not credited for periods in which the company lawfully deemed you not to be working for the company, I don't see how that is facially discriminatory in -- in any sense.              Did it say it was facially discriminatory?   I'm -- I'm just talking about your -- your assertion that it's facially discriminatory.           Did Basemore more say it was facially discriminatory?              What -- what do you do about section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we have held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona fide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of pre-Act discrimination?             That hinges -- that hinges on your "facially discriminatory."             Well, yes, that's -- that's rather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination and even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover pregnancy discrimination.         I mean, I --             You need pretty clear language to persuade me of that.                You mean there are a lot more suits coming behind this one --                -- for any kind of discrimination that preceded Title VII?                   When was Title VII enacted?             There may be still some of those people around.             I mean, you're scaring me. (Laughter.)
07-5439 +++$+++               If that's part of the analysis, this never ends.              If that's part of the analysis, there will always be some claim that there is some new method that's been devised, and once again executions are stayed throughout the country.              Those who oppose capital punishment entirely across the board are quite willing to take a careful look at everything.                   They are quite willing to take a look at other alternatives.                  That's the problem we come up with a decision that requires a careful look in every case whenever there is a newly developed method of execution the problem will always be before us and executions will always be impermissible. We agree with those concerns, Justice Scalia, I want to be clear.   Our standard is not a least risk --              You say that substantial, that comparison with other possibilities is not necessary so long as the only risk that is coming is a risk of negligence or improper execution of what, of what the protocol requires right?              You would say that so long, so long as the only risk comes from negligent application of the protocol, no comparison is required?              And if we decided that, if we decided that if this protocol is properly executed, it does not create a substantial risk that would be the end of the matter wouldn't it.              And we would not have another case in front of us next year.
07-544 +++$+++ 
07-552 +++$+++                But also not one in which the issue of standing was raised and decided.                 And our jurisprudence says that where we do not address the issue of standing the case has no precedential value on the subject.             Well, we don't count the lower courts. (Laughter.)              What's the earliest of those cases in our Court?              The earliest case in our Court that upholds this that, without specifically addressing the standing issue, gives judgment?              1920?              In Vermont Agency, in the Vermont Agency case, which dealt with qui tam, that many people, including the Justice Department, thought did not confer Article III standing, we held to the contrary that it did confer Article III standing, mainly because it had been around forever.           It was -- it was the understood part of the judicial power when the Constitution was adopted. Do you have any case prior to 1920 in which English courts or even early American courts thought that this, that this would be sufficient to bring a lawsuit?             Sure, but --             It's more than a wrinkle. The assignee keeps the money.             What's the earliest Federal court case you have?              Late 19th century?               I was under the same misimpression, I have to say, and I wrote it. (Laughter.)                I must say we seem to have come full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that the doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with Article III.    That it all -- the only thing it's there for is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our adversary system depends.            You've come full circle from that to now your argument that concrete adverseness doesn't matter at all.             Is there a combination of the two that's possible, that maybe one of the elements of Article III standing is that both parties have a stake in winning and losing?             Except for counterclaims. He says I have some counterclaims.               Mr. Englert, is this one lawsuit or 1,400 lawsuits, or however many clients you have?               How can it be -- how is it one lawsuit when there are, I mean, just a lot of different individual claims?             You think you could have brought this as a class action?             They opposed it on what seems to be a reasonable ground, that each of these claims is quite different.          There are different calls, different -- different amounts owing.                   Each case is not going to be judged on the same -- on the same facts.             Mr. Englert, could you --               Mr. Englert, can you explain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14 separate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against the same defendant, just by your acquiring them they sort of melt into one cause of action.                   How does that -- how does that happen?
07-562 +++$+++                  But what if Yugos and Fords are worth the same amount of money?                 But that's the thing here. Unless you show that for some -- for some reason -- were light cigarettes sold as a premium?                      Did they charge more for light cigarettes?               Answer my question.           Did they charge more for light cigarettes?             Excuse me before you go.     I don't understand that.        It is not specially targeted at cigarettes and at the harmful health effects of cigarettes?             It's a general statute but in Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at what its specific application in the case was.             You can't get away with just coming in and saying the general statute is an anti-deception statute.         Didn't we look at what the application of it was in the case?              Petitioner says you have in an earlier case.             The Commission -- when did the Commission know of this stuff?                  I had a case when I was on the Court of Appeals, so it had to be before 1984 involving so-called lip drape --              --    by which the smoker covers up the little holes that bring in some fresh air.              It's been general knowledge for a long time, and the FTC has done nothing about it.             Can I ask a question?           I plan to go back and see what the Government said in the -- in the case that Petitioner asserts you have effectively supported his position on -- on express pre-emption.   I plan to go back and read it.                    Assuming I agree with him rather than you, has the government's position changed from what it was then?                     As far as you know, is the government's position still the same, the position that you delicately did not bring to our attention?             Yes.      In Reilly.       I haven't read the brief there, I must say.                But suppose I agree with Petitioner.   Can I assume --             And do you assume that it's --             No, I'm not asking about -- I'll figure that out on my own.               Trust me.         I can probably figure that out.           But once I have figured it out, can I assume that that is still the government's position --             -- whatever it is?             You have no idea which direction that would lead?             I'm going to hold you to your last position, just -- just for fun. (Laughter.)
07-581 +++$+++               Why has it?         Why has it?     I mean, let's assume that my gripe with my employer is that he hasn't paid me my salary for the last two months.   Now, you can't take away my right to that unless I voluntarily waived it.              What is sacrosanct about the fact that my grievance here has some discrimination attached to it? Your briefing talks as though it is something totally apart from a mere economic right. Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about economics.   "I was fired because of discrimination."         "I wasn't promoted because of discrimination and therefore I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of money." Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the employee would have to go through the union-prescribed arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the last three months but does not have to do it for an economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?                You did raise that issue, but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue was that you win.    You said the consequence of the fact that that issue was involved in this case was a good reason not to -- for us to accept cert.                  And we didn't take your advice on that.                But it's a totally different issue whether because of that question you -- you should -- you should win the case.               It doesn't have to be within the question presented.              You -- you can sustain the judgment below on any ground.               The only question is whether we will -- we will agree that we should inquire into new ground.   That's all.               Why -- why doesn't this come within that?               Why don't many of these cases, if not most of them, come within that?                 The union negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the person says:   I should be at this level.                The only reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated against.               You -- you call it a non-economic theory.       Phooey, it's an economic case.              It is not taking away the right.     The -- the union is not taking away the right. It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to arbitration instead of to the courts.
07-582 +++$+++               Are they -- are they supposed to be more virtuous than courts?              I mean, courts all the time, you know, distinguish prior cases by saying, "well, you know, it was dictum, or we didn't really hold that and whatnot. " And I read their opinion as somewhat the same -- somewhat the same thing.                      They acknowledge at the end, and that's why they didn't impose a fine, that although this, you know, nothing that they had done up till now -- although their staff had -- would have misled anybody; still and all, it wasn't all that clear, and therefore we won't impose a fine.                     It seems to me --              It --                Well -- it was also, they said, you know, we sort of made this change without getting comments from the affected parties.                Give us a chance to receive comments and then -- and then explain.               They said that.          They gave the reason for their current belief.                    They said even when it is used just as a swear word or as an expletive, the reason it has its impact is precisely because it refers to these excretory or sexual activities; that's what -- that's what gives -- gives it its zing.              Of course there is.  -- instead of the F-Word. (Laughter.)              And I thought we've held that the Court can't engage in such expansion of and additions to the Administrative Procedure Act.              I thought that was --              -- one of our landmark decisions that what it says, it says, and we cannot add additional procedures.       You are suggesting we add an additional procedure that when it deals with speech, the explanation has to be really good.              Not just --              You are asking for a higher standard than the APA --               You should have complained to the lower court about that.                You should have said, please don't decide this on the APA issue.                   This is a First Amendment case.        You should reach the constitutional issue.                 But you went on the APA issue, and then you come up here and say:                   I don't want to -- I don't want to discuss the APA; I want to discuss, you know, the First Amendment.                 The APA simpliciter; not the APA, you know --               He does good stuff now and then. (Laughter.)                 These arguments apply not just to the isolated, once-upon-a-time use, but even to continued use.   You could say the same thing about just filling a program with these expletives, right?             That's not --             That's not, I suppose, what you are arguing against here, is it?               There goes Pacifica.               Isn't that a --               Isn't that a heckler's veto?               What if people like, you know, going on and on with expletives and offensive words?   Are those of us who are offended by that hecklers and you can't take our positions into account because you're giving effect to a heckler?               I mean -- I don't think so.              Do you think your clients have had anything to do with that? (Laughter.)                You do, indeed, but you don't have them presented as something that is -- is normal in polite company, which is what happens when it comes out in -- in television shows.                     This is a coarsening of manners that is -- that is produced by -- by the shows.    So I am -- you know, I -- I am not persuaded by the argument that people are more accustomed to hearing these words than they were in the past.                More tolerant or more used to hearing it?                Candidly, I think there is a difference.              Let me ask about deferring there.     You seem to be suggesting that since there is a criminal penalty for a violation of this statute, the agency has no role in -- in defining what -- what the terms of the statute mean.
07-588 +++$+++               Except -- except, you say, when it's grossly disproportionate?              Where -- where -- where do you find that?     Or the Second Circuit said, anyway.             You are using the word in a strange -- economically available?                 Economically feasible maybe.   But you wouldn't say economically available.   You wouldn't say I can't buy the house because for me it's not economically available.                   I might say it's not economically feasible, it's not economically possible, but it's not economically available?   That's weird.             I disagree with that.             But that -- but that -- but that doesn't answer, it seems to me, the question.                   Yes, the best available for that purpose, but what is best for that purpose could include other factors such as how expensive is it and -- and how much it harms the industry and all sorts of things.             Why?      Why does it?    I don't know how you draw the lines you are drawing.                   You say yes, "best" includes whether it would bankrupt the industry.    Well, if it includes whether it would bankrupt the industry, why shouldn't it include whether it would bankrupt the individual power company?              I -- I agree with you on that, whether it's borne by the industry.               But you draw the line there.              Why isn't it where that line is drawn up to the agency?              Okay.             I assume you can't get a variance and you also would say the EPA cannot take it into account if this particular plant -- although the company as a whole is quite prosperous, this is a small plant, and it's not generating that much electricity. It's really just not worth it to put in this big tower. We are going to close down.              That would not be something that EPA could take into account.             Well, it has -- it has required, not just permitted but required cost-benefit analysis in other areas.          What --             What -- what is your response to the fact that it -- it seems ridiculous to allow it, and indeed require it in effluent situations where human health is at stake, and yet to forbid it in this intake situation when you were just talking about the snail darter.    What -- what's your response to that?              And did that section 307 not allow cost-benefit?
07-591 +++$+++              I don't see the difference between the two.    I mean, the one, he saw the blue car going down the street, which through other evidence can be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going to be connected to the defendant.                 And in both cases that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the prosecution for the conviction.               I don't see the difference between the two.                 Ballistics as well?        You would extend this to ballistic tests?             You -- you don't have to bring in the ballistic expert?               You can just --             I don't understand that difference.              Why not?         I know I prefer one thing, the custody.        It's very important to know whether indeed this was the particular substance that was taken from the defendant.             And to establish that, you have to establish a line of custody.                   And you can't do that without getting in the person who did the test.              He says -- the policeman says, "And I gave it to the University of Massachusetts lab."               "And I watched when they marked it in a particular way."               How do I know that that thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who wrote this report?               So you say you can require witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did the testing, you can require witnesses to testify?                    All the way up to there but not the analyst himself?             No.     No.      They are admissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned because they are not testimonial.             We are back to Roberts then.              Don't these people have to appear before the same judge again and again?                  The point made these are repeat attorneys, and I don't think you make friends and influence people among judges by insisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is obviously not needed.             But --             It's not material prepared for trial.   It's not material that was generated precisely in order to prosecute an individual.             Exactly.             Let's, let's assume that it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what time the shot was fired, okay?              And you mean to tell me if -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at the time the shot was fired, that would not be testimony?   Yes, the clock is a machine, right?             He is just reciting what the clock said.              And there was not a broad exception at common law for public records created in anticipation of criminal litigation.
07-6053 +++$+++               Well, it didn't put it in those very words, but I think a lot of -- of the quotations from opinions cited by your friend seemed to me to say that. But why don't you start off by telling -- by explaining to us why these many cases excluded the dying declaration of the murdered person when -- if it could not be shown that the murdered person knew when the declaration was made that he or she was dying?                    If the rule that you're announcing was the rule at common law, all of those would have come in because that declaration said this Defendant killed me.               And, therefore, it would have been true in all of those cases that this defendant procured the absence of the witness from the trial.                    How do you explain that. And there are many cases.                   It's not just a few.   The requirement in the dying declaration cases that the -- that the declarant be aware of impending death is uniform.    Why even bother with that requirement if it could all come in under -- under this procurement of the absence-of-the-witness rule?             I'm not sure you've answered my question.      Why wasn't it enough for the prosecution to say:     This dying person said that this defendant killed her; therefore, this declaration can come in because this defendant procured the absence of this declarant by killing her?             Nobody even ever makes those arguments.   They fight it out on whether the declarant was aware of impending death or not, but that would have been totally irrelevant if it all comes in under -- under the rule that you're arguing for here.              Doesn't it have to be interpreted that way?      You don't contend it could be interpreted differently?              Just because it says so, I mean.              Can you give us one case from the common law, just one, in which the procurement of a witness's absence exception to the Confrontation Clause was applied where there was no intent to prevent the witness from testifying?              I don't think you do either.             You wouldn't want us to get caught up in the limitations of the Confrontation Clause?             If that's a fault, it's a fault that also exists with the rule being argued by your opponent, isn't it?              Maybe I have to take that back.    Maybe it -- it's very -- it would be very unusual that someone would kill a victim in order to prevent her testifying at a murder trial which is not yet in prospect because you haven't murdered her.               So these cases may be very rare.         So maybe that is an advantage of her rule over yours, that you would very rarely have to find the defendant guilty of the very crime for which he's being prosecuted in order to apply the -- the exception to the Confrontation Clause.              Okay.              It would be rare on her theory; it wouldn't be rare on yours.                     It happens all the time on yours, I would think.
07-608 +++$+++                 Well, wait.      You say that that was the compromise.          I don't know that you have any evidence to -- to show that that was an intentional -- an intentional alteration made in the House of Representatives.    Do you?         I mean --             But the other side says that the reason that was the case was that they objected to the fact that -- what was its language -- the -- the old version did not say a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."   It was -- it was broader.             Where -- where is the earlier version?    Do we have the earlier version anywhere --             -- in the materials in front of us?             Thank you.               Did this structure come from Senator Lautenberg?               Where did it come from?              It came out of the House version.     The House version had this which was different from the Senate version that Lautenberg was responsible for?              So this language came from the House?              Excuse me, Senator Lautenberg would not have been the drafter of this language.              What do you mean would have?   Did it language come over to the Senate from the House or not?               This very form that was ultimately enacted was the form that came over from the House to the Senate?               I suppose it gives greater assurance of what exactly the prior conviction was.                       If there is just a prior conviction of misdemeanor violence, you have to go back, I suppose, and look at the conviction, look at the testimony to find out whether indeed it was domestic violence.                       It was just a general -- general assault statute.                       You don't know it was committed in the home or not. Whereas if you're -- if you're convicted of the crime, the misdemeanor of violence against a spouse or a relative like this, you know exactly what the -- what the crime is?               I understand that -- that when someone purchases a firearm, they have to affirm, check a box, I have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence.      Is that how it reads?                  And that goes to, you know, to the Federal Government and they check the records of convictions. How -- how would your client check that?                     I have been -- I have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence, if he had been convicted of assault and the assault happened to be domestic assault would -- would he be perjuring himself if he said no?              Does -- does it make clear whether the offense has to be domestic -- a domestic violence offense or whether an ordinary assault offense will qualify if as a matter of fact it was domestic?              I don't understand what you've said.              Oh, and it's drafted the way the statute should have been drafted.                  Isn't that interesting. In other words, it breaks out the "was committed by a current or former spouse" and makes that a separate provision, rather than a part of the element "use of attempted force against a family member."              Well, sure it would.   Just as an "is" --              I mean, if you want to add words you can add "if," you can add "as is," you could rewrite the statute a lot of ways.                Excuse me.       Under anybody's view, it made it narrow.           Under Lautenberg's view, it made it narrow.                How did it make it broader? I mean, it used to cover cutting -- cutting a credit card.   Now, it no longer does.              Of course it does.
07-610 +++$+++                The issue is not whether that's a fair thing for the national union to do.                   The issue is whether the person who is being compelled against his will to pay dues to the union is getting anything back for that compelled payment.                And even though the national union may be acting in an entirely fair fashion, given its national objectives, the -- the compelled payment is not doing what our cases seem to say it must do.    It has to be paying for services rendered.              Well, it doesn't have to do that.   It can use the money of its union members any way it wants.   It can contribute to the national all of their money if it wishes.          We are only talking about that portion of the union income which comes from people who don't want to join the union.
07-615 +++$+++  
07-636 +++$+++              Well, we -- I mean, we could have -- you know, we should have thought of that when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the -- to the one question on which you agree with the Petitioner.    But we did do that, didn't we, even though the other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose, and we said we -- we are not going to get into that?             We just want to decide this question, which is an important question all by itself.             Do you know any other case in which we have explicitly declined to accept a question and then have used one of these other back doorways of -- of answering it anyway?             I don't know of any.      I mean maybe -- maybe we have but --              Did -- did we recognize in earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan documents?              Again, assuming there has been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of course, the argument you're confronted with is:               I haven't changed anything.           The prior beneficiary simply -- simply refused to accept it, waived it.                  I haven't changed the designation at all.             Well, I think it's a harder question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone into it as deeply as I would like to, principally because we rejected that -- that question.               Do you know of any case in which we've done this --              -- rejected the question and then decided it?              That's what I'm asking. Yes.              You are sure of the answer. You don't know of any case.             It would be the classic case but for the fact that we had rejected that question.   Had we not been asked to decide it and said no, it would be the classic case, I agree.              Can we expect that to happen in future cases when we turn down a question and amici and people come in and brief the question anyway and then ask us to decide it?             Undoubtedly we should have granted it.              Where would I find the latter?   If I wanted to read it?              Which I do. (Laughter.)              21A?                 No, it also goes to the question of who is the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.                 If there was a waiver and there had been no order, your friend's contention is by traditional common law, the person who would have been entitled to it would have been his client.                 I mean, I don't see how this language helps you.           It sort of restates the question, but --                 Right.                 If there had been no order --               Oh, I see.       I see.               I see your point.         Does he agree with that, that apart from the divorce decree, there is no waiver?               I got you.               I see.             You say the waiver is in the order?             And without the order, there has been no waiver.             We'll have to see whether your friend agrees with that.             I'll bet he doesn't. (Laughter.)             What if they had agreed to the waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the domestic relations order?           Just apart from that, they have a separate signed waiver.               We'd be in the same suit that you're -- that you say we have to avoid, wouldn't we?             Well, if it's an alienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an alienation.                What about some other waiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with a domestic relations thing?             You know -- "I've made my -- my eldest son a beneficiary."                It turns out, you know, he is fat and happy; he doesn't need the money and he agrees to waive it, so -- so I can give it to an impecunious daughter.       Okay?        What -- what happens with that?                Ah. Oh, oh, oh. You're jumping over to the other argument.                      Let's leave that argument out.                Yes, but you would still -- the plan would still have to make some inquires, wouldn't it?                Yes.      Not getting in the plan documents.               Sure.              Well, that's -- that's the point that troubles me.          It's -- it's the "acquirer's" language. Does -- does the person who -- who receives the -- the refused benefit acquire it from the other person?     He certainly doesn't do so for Federal tax purposes.              Does he acquire it from a participant or beneficiary?              I thought the -- the notion is it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to the person refusing it had never occurred.                I mean, there is -- there is no gift tax payable or anything else.
07-665 +++$+++                 You say in a public forum. I mean, that sort of begs the question.                   I mean, that -- that encapulates your -- your -- encapsulates your answer.    Has the -- has the city allowed anybody to put up a monument there willy-nilly? I mean, a public forum, as you know, we can have praise in the park, we can have protest.                  Anybody can do it, so long as you get a license and you're not interfering with some other group.                  That's a public forum.    Has this city said anybody can put up a monument in this park?              It's a public forum for some things.    Is it a public forum for everything?                  It may be a public forum for processions, for parades.                    But it is a public -- is it a public forum for anybody constructing a monument?             The other side says that some of these monuments, especially in the Civil War battlegrounds, do indeed show who the donors are.             What -- Mr. Sekulow says that some of these monuments, notably those in the Civil War battlefields, do show who the donors are. Now is that Government speech or private speech?             So they have to go?             Now that the Government converted them, it passes a law saying, what, we -- we adopt this?             Isn't it enough that the Government accepts ownership of it and places it on the Government's property?       Isn't that a manifestation of the Government's adoption of it?              It depends on what you mean by adopting one version.           If it's adopting the version by saying these Ten Commandments are the word of God, that's one thing.     If it's adopting it by just saying this is a version of the Ten Commandments that has had a very significant place in the history of the American people.              I wouldn't care what version it was if that's all they're doing.              Nor would the Mormons in Utah, I think.              Ms. Harris, we -- we need a clear rule here.   We -- we can't expect the courts or the cities for that matter to investigate in every case what the degree of the Government's involvement in the --   and what is the degree, 50 percent, 45 percent, 36 years?   I mean, we are going to make up a percentage? That's -- that's not the way threshold constitutional questions ought to be resolved or resolvable.                  We need a clear rule that the cities can rely on.             Is there an historical basis for that, or you just made it up?                  You think it would be a good idea?       I mean, if that had been the practice over the past 200 years for all of these monuments that -- that, you know, are strewed across the landscape, then I'd say yes, that's probably what the difference is. But I'm not aware that there is any such -- such requirement and any such practice on the part of Government.    You're -- you're creating a new world.             It may be a very nice world but it happens not to be the world under which our Constitution has subjected this country.              So that's all right, the first 95 monuments, whoever -- whoever put them up, okay?   It's a monument to chocolate chip cookies or whatever else, is that it?           First 95?              This is a practical solution to the problem?              You will say just the opposite when you come back here to challenge the Ten Commandments monument on -- on Establishment Clause grounds.   You will say something like this:             Anybody who comes into this park and seeing this monument owned by the Government, on Government land, will think that the Government is endorsing this message. That's what you will say now.              Now why would it be true there, but it's not true here?              Would anybody think that on public land owned by the Government the Government disagrees with this message?             Suppose the resolution of adoption by the City Council just says, "The City Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's attention."             Is that enough?               What if it's just a statue of George Washington?      What kind of a resolution does the city council adopt?        "We endorse everything George Washington ever said"?               Well, if --               That's right, and I think they would adopt a resolution that says, "We think George Washington is worthy of respect and emulation on the part of our citizens."               If it could say that, why couldn't it say the same thing about the Ten Commandments?   "We think the Ten Commandments are worthy of respect and" -- and I wouldn't say "emulation"; I would say "respect and reverence by our citizens."               Would that be enough?               I don't know what that means.               It has acquired the memorial.   The City has acquired property in this memorial and has agreed for this memorial to be placed in the city park.    Period.         "We believe that the Ten Commandments which are embodied in this memorial are worthy of respect by the citizens of Pleasant Grove" -- is that enough?               I don't know what that means.   You keep saying it, and I don't know what it means.                I would have thought adopting what I said shows that it is adopting the content of the monument insofar as the monument says the Ten Commandments should be respected by the citizens of Pleasant Grove.    Is that enough?                Or it has to say, "We believe in the Ten Commandments"?                You don't think that's fairly implied by the mere fact that it is there in Pleasant Grove's park and that Pleasant Grove City Council has allowed it to be constructed there?                 Don't you think that's implicit?              Maybe the City doesn't know --              -- know what you mean by "We adopt," just as I don't know what you mean by "We adopt."

What if he doesn't find out about the fact that notice, proper notice, wasn't given to his counsel, so he doesn't find out about the gravamen for the appeal until after a year?              Right.           Right.                I don't think (d)(1)(B) does.   It requires an impediment to have been removed. There is no impediment being removed.                       He just didn't find out the facts.                Right.           Right.                I just made one up.             I mean, it's a hypothetical.                 There is more of a problem than that, as the other side just said.                   (1)(B), which is the gimmick you are using to get out of this, doesn't speak of not being able to find out in time; it speaks of the date on which the impediment to file an application --                 -- is removed.                 Oh, you said (D), not (B).              The problem with (1)(D) is that the claim or claims presented that is referred to in (D) is not the denial of the appeal.                It's the claim or claims that he wants to bring in his Federal habeas. That's why (1)(D) doesn't work, you have to go back to (1)(B). I'm talking to you. (Laughter.)             (B).             But that's your fault.              Convicted felons don't always make intelligent decisions, you are saying.

07-77 +++$+++               Do you agree that the lawsuit to invalidate it was filed as soon as was feasible?              Why didn't the Alabama Supreme Court say that in this very case?               Excuse me.       I don't think -- I don't think I follow you that, as a matter of Alabama law, it went into effect.                 Just because the statute said it went into effect does not prove that it went into effect.    I think the Alabama --               -- the Alabama Supreme Court would say it never went into effect because it was unconstitutional.              That rule of law renders constitutional under State law an act that would otherwise not be constitutional.              Well, that's what you're saying.              You're saying that's the effect:   It locks it in.              Oh, but it can't go back.              For the reason that, absent their coming up with a new law, what law would be in effect?                What does the Alabama Supreme Court preclear?          Where it was redistricting and it had a redistricting plan, I can see it would send over to the attorney general the new redistricting plan. What -- what do the justices of the Alabama Supreme Court have to come before the attorney general to get his benediction upon?                 Do they submit their opinion and say, "Mr. Attorney General, please approve our opinion"?                 All right.         What?                 Before the attorney general, you're talking about?                 No, no.         First of all, you're trying to get -- the quick way is to get it from the attorney general.                 I understand.         What was supposed -- what should have been submitted to the attorney general?    What is the Alabama Supreme Court's --              Do you have any problem with the republican form of government provision of the Constitution?              As I understand what's going on here, the -- the legislative process of the people of Alabama, whereby something is invalid as a law, suddenly becomes a law because the Federal attorney general has given it preclearance.                 The people have never voted for that properly under their Constitution. Yet, it becomes law in Alabama.              And that's a republican form of government?                 From an Alabama law that had never been adopted by the people of Alabama?                 Not validated, so --              Mr. Shanmugan, what does the attorney general do when he gets -- I mean, does he just preclear any old thing that somebody shoves under his nose?   Does he look to see whether there is litigation pending on it?            Was this litigation pending when it was --              -- the plan was submitted --

07-773 +++$+++                 What is the dispute?           You say the dispute is not defined by what -- what has been brought in a complaint.                But you -- from your argument, I would gather that a court would be able to imagine a counterclaim.         Once it finds out, you know, what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about, the court could imagine that there would be a counterclaim for interest or for something else.               It's very strange to decide Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined -- imagined complaints.               So the problem with his -- I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to imagine anything.               Well --               You don't have to imagine complaints.     You -- you don't have to invent litigation.              It's close to inconceivable to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct litigation that is not yet in existence.              No, but your position is it doesn't have to exist.         Had that litigation not been brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to consider what is the dispute between the parties and what kind of complaints could that dispute have generated.              If we accept your theory, this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that are further down the line?               Well, it makes a nullity of it, except that it gets into the Federal court the decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or not. As I understood the purpose of the Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in State cases as well.       And it's entirely compatible with that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct arbitration in a case this involves an underlying controversy that's purely non-Federal.             Why -- why can't you have sort of modified look, through like a modified limited hangout or whatever it was?            That is to say, you can look through for the purpose of determining whether the arbitration agreement raises a Federal question.                    But that doesn't mean you have to look through to determine whether the underlying controversy raises a Federal question.
07-8521 +++$+++               I thought this was a Federal law.    Is this a Conyers law; is that what it is here?              Did his colleagues know what he said?             Should the Constitution be amended it would cover that, right?             Mr. Jay, I assume that (a)(1), which provides for the appointment of counsel to conduct the trial in a capital case, would not have very much application either, would it?             Only in federal capital cases, of which there are very, very few.                 Surely, you could.   You could put all I don't remember weight on the other executive or other -- and you could say that's the only provision where it's apparently clear from the text that State proceedings were included. Assuming you are wrong, that there are non-executive State clemency proceedings, you are sure that there aren't?                Excuse me, what do you mean by the federal-State balance?               Because this is funding somebody to argue against the interests of the State, isn't it?                I mean, assuming the state has convicted somebody, you are arguing against the State.               And the federal government is funding that.             And that's the government's position, under this provision, even if -- even if State funding -- well, as you say State isn't covered anyway.             Assuming State funding is covered, assuming representation in the State is covered, it does seem to be the case that the test of whether you get some Federal lawyer appointed is not whether you don't have a State lawyer, but rather whether you can pay for counsel, right?             Can pay.             That's strange.
07-854 +++$+++              That is certainly -- you know, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly not the theory on which the decision below was based. The decision below says "Neither" -- speaking of Imbler and prior cases -- "Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has considered whether claims regarding failure to train, failure to supervise or failure to develop an officewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation like the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute immunity." And I could quote portions of the opinion they are.             They are talking about supervising prosecutors.         They are talking about training prosecutors and having an officewide policy regarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.               Page 5?               They are not talking about just collecting information.               They are talking about, as they clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train and supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding the Giglio obligations.
07-869 +++$+++               Mr. Collins, suppose -- I gather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a Hatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that prohibits Federal employees from engaging in political activity, and suppose it decided that not only should the State employees at the capital not engage in political activities, but it's a problem for any governmental employee to do that; they ought to be neutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on the basis of whether they are campaigning for one party or another, and we don't want them to be coerced into campaigning for one party or another.                  Now, I assume that such a law would violate the First Amendment if it were extended to all employers.             Saying no -- no company employee, no private employee can engage in political activity would surely violate the First Amendment. Would it violate the First Amendment if it was extended? Certainly, it doesn't when it's applied to State employees because there are a lot of State Hatch Acts. And you're saying it would violate the First Amendment as applied to county and municipal employees?               Why not?               You're saying -- you're analogizing these to private entities.                    That's your whole point.               This is not a creature of the State.     You're saying what the First Amendment -- as the First Amendment applies to private individuals, so it applies here.     This is regulation by the State, rather than the State's control of State government.
07-901 +++$+++                Mr. Lannet, in -- in connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be 30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will be 15 years? Do you think if the -- if the statute were framed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we would leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been used or not?               Well, regardless of who proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent determination that he did not use a firearm could be left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?               I don't see a dime's worth of difference between that and Apprendi.             Booker/Fanfan as well, as adopted, right?    I mean that was what the dissenters in Booker/Fanfan would have --              The core question is is the defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a certain penalty if a particular fact is found.              And the answer would be, yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't use a gun to get a lesser penalty.                 And once you bring in the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it means that it has to be found by the jury.             No entitlement to a lesser sentence?
07-9712 +++$+++               I think it's plain.          What about paragraph 9?      Are you ignoring paragraph 9?
07-984 +++$+++                If EPA were to amend the performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be a valid regulation?               Could the -- could the EPA allow a point source to discharge sand slurry -- there's nothing in it but sand -- into a river?                 Wouldn't you have to -- wouldn't you need some permission from the EPA to do that?   Wouldn't that violate the Act?               I want to discharge.       I have a pipe and there is sand on my land which is being washed away.   I'm discharging all that sand into a river.               Would that violate --               Discharge of a pollutant.             Now, if I do the same thing in a lake, because I want to fill the lake, of what possible application is the fill standard unless it permits what would otherwise be prohibited under -- under the earlier sections?             Even though it violates effluent standards.             But you say -- you say that if you discharge sand into -- into a river it violates effluent standards.             Yes, but -- but do you have a -- a case over these 40 years where a company was trying to use the emission from the mine as a fill material in a lake rather than in a settling pond, and where the EPA, despite the fact that it was using it to fill a lake, applied its effluent standards?                Well, then --                Evidently not.           I mean, the EPA says not.     Do you have a -- an instance where it was prohibited where a company wanted to -- to emit fill material into a lake and the EPA said no, you can't do it, because of the effluent limitations?                But your -- your 40 years of experience then really don't -- don't cover this case.   People have been putting it into settling ponds. Let me ask you another question.                       The other side says that the alternative to this would be even worse, or it sounds worse to me, anyway.                       What -- what is your solution, closing down the mine?                       Is there --              Why do you said the EPA preferred the -- the solution of filling in the wetlands and creating an ash Pentagon?              Well, if it really felt that way, couldn't it simply have vetoed the permit?              So it couldn't have felt very strongly about it.              Right.              It couldn't have preferred it very much, or it would have vetoed this one.              Plankton and stuff.
07-9995 +++$+++                 Well, does it really? Suppose I agree with you that there is -- there is no Federal constitutional violation.                 But I also think that in assessing the consequence of a State-law violation the Illinois court here was looking to Federal law and was trying to apply the Federal law of harmless error. If that's the situation, would we not have the obligation to determine, or wouldn't we have the obligation to determine, whether it was properly applying the Federal law of harmless error?                Even though it didn't have to, it chose to use the Federal law of harmless error to -- to apply to this State violation.              So the Illinois Supreme Court can happily go along blaming everything on us, so when it stands for reelection, it can say, well, we are just applying Federal law.              I know, but that's the consequence of your answer to that question.           It seems to me there is much to be said for the disposition that where a State court even in resolving a State-law question uses a Federal principle, adverts specifically to Federal law and cites Federal cases, it would cover you.              I would certainly agree that if the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court used the Federal harmless-error rule was because it was assuming a Federal constitutional violation, once we reject that assumption, the whole thing drops out.              But is that entirely clear from the opinion?              Is it clear that the Illinois Supreme Court wouldn't have used the same test under simply Illinois law?              The problem is the -- the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court found:                 That there was no error of constitutional dimension, meaning Federal constitutional dimension.                The only reason it -- it found that is because it found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.              It is the cart before the horse.
08-1008 +++$+++             It has to be one or the other, though.    You -- you -- is it your position that if this is substantive, as you contend, it cannot be procedural?    So New York State could not apply this -- this rule to out-of-State causes of action, and if it did, you -- you ought to have lost this case.
08-103 +++$+++             "Until."         That's a limitation period.            Until preregistration or registration has been made.            That's our limitation period.
08-1065 +++$+++              I don't know what you mean by that.            The difference here is that the -- the absolutely immune act which follows the -- the unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by the very actor who performed the earlier act that -- that you say induces liability.              And so the argument is, what's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if you can simply drag him into litigation by -- by alleging that he at an earlier stage committed a violation?            That's the difference.     I mean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is the same actor who has absolute liability whom you're trying to get on the basis of -- of earlier action.             But it won't be protected. They won't have that assurance, because when they -- when they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess the production at trial will be protected, but you're -- you're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but you got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we can sue you, not for introducing it at trial, but for fabricating it before trial. I -- I don't see that there is much of a difference as far as the deterrent effect upon the prosecutor is concerned.
08-108 +++$+++                You have to rename it the rule of, you know, who gets hurt the most or something.                 Is this in the statute?                 Well, let's not say Congress, then.    Does -- does the Committee?               You could also say you get two years for knowing that there is a discreet victim. I mean -- I -- you can describe it either way.               And it makes sense either way.
08-1107 +++$+++                More than -- more than what, more than any other single State?               But it doesn't say the -- the "principal State of business."                 It's the "principal place of business."      Is there a difference between the two?              I don't understand why, somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and, hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is likely to identify with Hertz. Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz outlets in New Jersey as there are in California.           The only reason that you come up with California is it's an enormous State.   It has 10         percent of the population. But as far as the citizens of the State identifying with that -- with that company and, therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that company -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey and California are absolutely the same.               Well, it is one of the factors in other -- in other states as well.                  It's part of the totality of the circumstances.                  You certainly increase your odds to move your headquarters.             We don't worry about private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal court, establishing residence in a different State?                   We don't worry about them gaming the system, do we?             Sure.       But -- but you can have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't know that people do it for foreign reasons because they want to get in or out of Federal court.                You really don't worry about that, it seems to me.             I know some rich individuals that might have the incentive.             That's a surprise. (Laughter.)
08-1119 +++$+++              If indeed "in contemplation of bankruptcy" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to be for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code -- right?   If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness arguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal anyway, wouldn't it?             So even without this statute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about whether he's doing something that is unlawful.            The lawyer runs that risk anyway, whether this statute applies or not.                 He has -- he has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on creditors.             If they're -- if they're, as the hypothetical suggests, representing only big companies, they're probably not advertising to the general public anyway.
08-1134 +++$+++            Do you acknowledge that what the bankruptcy court did here was wrong?               Do you acknowledge that?           Okay.        And it should not have done it, and future bankruptcy courts shouldn't do it?           It makes a big difference to how I m going to look on this case.               I mean, if you  -           Is it -- is it easy for a bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a student loan debt?      I mean, would the bankruptcy filing -- filing show it -- you know, student loan debt?           It would?           Yes.           That -- that's not enough for me, that it's not improper for him to do it.          I want you to say that that is what he ought to do.           And you re not willing to say that.   You re willing to say that bankruptcy courts can do that if they like, but, you know, if they have a kid that has a lot of bankruptcy debts, he has a soft heart for student loan debts, he sees this as a student loan debt, all right, let's give this kid a break.             And he enters -- that's okay?             So you would say it's wrong for the bankruptcy court to do it without a waiver, and -- but you re leaving open if there is a clear waiver, despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you re not -- you re not necessarily willing to say that the bankruptcy court can't do that?          If that s the price of your winning this case, it's clearly worth it now -- agreeing with Justice Breyer on that point.          Yes.     I mean, if indeed the Court would not be willing to go along with -- with your assertion that you can't undo it later, once it's been done, unless it is clear that it should not be done and that the bankruptcy judge shouldn't do it, and that a lawyer shouldn't propose it -- if that's the condition, then you should accept it, right?             Because you want to win this case --          I guess I don't understand your position, because I thought you had said that this should not have been discharged and now -- now you ve answered to Justice Ginsburg that so long as the -- as the creditor appears they can all be discharged.             Now, which is it?          Even if the creditor appears, it shouldn't be discharged.             I thought that that's what you had said before.           But now you are saying that so long as a creditor appears, all of these are dischargeable.          Which is it?
08-1175 +++$+++           It set forth the substance of what had to be conveyed --          --     but it set forth, on page 484, its belief that the FBI warning adequately conveyed that substance.      It said this warning is consistent with our opinion today.               And -- and that warning said --          You want to read it?          Good.             Well, I mean, that s so much worse than -- than --             -- what you have here.          This Court said in Miranda --          Yes.          But I must say I -- this is - this is angels dancing on the head of a pin.              You want us to believe that your client, who decided to talk, even though he was told he could consult an attorney before any question was asked, and he could consult an attorney at any time during the interview, and he went ahead and -- and confessed -- you are saying, oh, if he had only known.              Oh, if I knew that I could have an attorney present during the interview, well, that would have been a different kettle of fish and I would never have confessed. I mean, doesn't that seem to you quite fantastic?          I'm curious goes back to them, do you think they can deviate?                They were answering a certified question, which was simply whether this -- this warning complied with Miranda. That was the only certified question. So when it goes back, I assume they, having said no, will now have to say yes.                 Can they go on and say:   Oh, and by the way, even though it doesn't violate Miranda, we think it violates the State Constitution?          Well, but that --          But that wasn't the question asked of them.        The only question asked of them was whether it complied with Miranda.           Well, the question asked Does the failure to provide express advice of the right to the presence of counsel during questioning vitiate Miranda warnings? Okay?   That's the question.             They have a footnote after Miranda, which reads,  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436.         I take that to mean that the question is whether this warning violated Miranda.           Right.           Absolutely.          Well, that's true, but -- but if they -- if they felt the authority to go beyond Miranda, wouldn't they have had to say no to this question, if we find that way, and then go on to say: But it does violate our own?           And that's beyond the question that they -- that they -- that was certified to them.          Right.       I --          Sometimes, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. (Laughter.)
08-1191 +++$+++              Well, what is your test for whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or not?             I'm not sure how you interpret the language that you -- that you just read, when you say to use or employ in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on the National Security Exchange or any security not so registered. Now, is it your point that in order to avoid an international extension of it, it should apply only to securities?    What?             Securities purchased and sold in the United States?            Is that it?             What if it's not -- what if it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that otherwise the person would dispose of?             Well, is that your only point?   Or is your point also that you wouldn't need section 30 if -- if 10(b) were -             -- were read as broadly.             Schmidt is the German. He's in Germany. (Laughter.)              I am frankly less concerned with your -- your test for the private cause of action, the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with that -- than I am with your test for -- for the jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a totality of the circumstances test.                     It doesn't seem to me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional question.   You don't want to spend time litigating the totality of the circumstances.             Well, okay.             I guess we don't have to say anything about -- about what the government can do, do we?
08-1198 +++$+++           Where -- where -- where do they say that they were interpreting the intent of the parties, that it was the intent of the parties to permit class arbitration?          Excuse me, what part -- 50?          I thought you said 59a to start.          You said 49a.          Right.          Or to preclude.          Right.          It -- it seems to me that the arbitrators are putting the choice in a false manner.   It isn't whether, on the one hand, they agreed to permit it or, on the other hand, they agreed to prohibit it.   Just forget about the latter.              They must have agreed to permit it. Where did the arbitrators say they agreed -- they agreed to permit it?       Not simply, they did not agree to prohibit it.    You don't have to agree to prohibit everything in a contract.               You have to agree to permit it.   That's what contracting is about.          Well, no, I mean, they -- they put it just -- just the way that -- that is not good for you.     "The panel is struck by the fact that Respondents have been unable to cite any post-Bazzle panels or arbitrators that construed their clauses as prohibiting a class action." That's not what -- what they have to find. They must find positively that it permits a class action.            Just give me some language that says that.    I -- there is nothing in that paragraph that says it.          So the only language you can point to is that -- is that "any dispute" language on 50a?          You are hanging your whole -- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators not only found that the contract did not prohibit it, but found that the contract positively authorized class action, upon that language on 50a?             Where -- where --             "Clear language" is the point of that sentence.       "Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language that forbids class arbitration. The panel, however, agrees with Respondents that the test is a more general one.           Arbitrators must look to the language to ascertain the parties' intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.             The point of those two sentences is simply that in order for us to find that you didn't preclude it -- and if you didn't preclude it, it's okay -- you don't need clear language.           We have to look to everything.             Well, that's how I read the two sentences.           I used to teach contracts. Did you know that?           I used to teach contracts.             What page?           May I -- you know, that doesn't help me a lot.      What does it mean, if it permits it?   I mean, I guess you could say, if there's a background rule, that whether the parties agree to it or not, it's okay. Does  permits it  mean  authorizes it ?               Does -- does that mean whether the parties have agreed to it? Is that what  permits  mean there?           What page -- what page are you quoting from?          Not in this industry, however.          Yes.
08-1200 +++$+++               Mr. Coakley, one of your earlier statements confused me.              You relied upon the fact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal errors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think you -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the law to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not covered. But as I understood the situation, every court of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980 had held that legal errors were not -- were not included, as -- as your opponent says, they are not included here.   So the amendment to TILA was just an affirmation of the judicial interpretation of the language similar to the language here.              Every court of appeals to construe it had held that mistakes of law were not covered.   Is that accurate or not?              Well, then -- then your prior statement was very misleading.              There is no basis for saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing the prior meaning of TILA.           There is no basis for saying that.   All you had were just a few district court opinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out the other way.               I would think all -- which way do these cut?     I mean, the fact that there is criminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in precisely the opposite direction.                  You would want to provide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would think.   Why -- am I missing something here?               I would think --                Mr. Coakley, why do you need a safe harbor if there is no store?                  I mean what is the purpose of -- of having this procedure, however inefficient it may be, what is the purpose of having it unless you were going to be liable if you make a mistake of law?                You are talking about a safe harbor rule.     Leave the harbor.                What does that have to do -- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's prospective or not?      The point is what benefit does it give to the person who is asking?                  If the person is not going to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he ever use it?              There are severe limits on the liability, aren't there?             Isn't there a thousand -- isn't it a $1,000 limit?              That's not big bucks for an attorney, is it? (Laughter.)
08-1214 +++$+++            So you -- while saying that there s no cause of action for this tort claim, you nonetheless say that the tort claim can be considered an unfair labor practice by the labor board.             Why does that make any sense?        Has -- has the board, in fact, declared a party who is not a party to the labor contract guilty of an unfair labor practice in prior cases?
08-1224 +++$+++         We -- we have a Federal agency that's -- that deals with communicable diseases.    It's part of the National Institute of Health, I believe.    Is that agency ultra vires?        I mean, aren't communicable -- I mean, if anything relates to interstate commerce, it's communicable diseases, it seems to me.          Try the Tenth Amendment.        The government can spend money on whatever it wants.         That's the spending power.   They can set up hospitals.              The issue is whether they can force somebody into a hospital, not whether they can set up hospitals. I was going to ask you to tell us why the sky will not fall if we -- if we go the way you would like us to.   I assume that if the problem is that the States are unwilling to incur the expenses for these people, that Congress could pass a statute saying the Federal Government will pay the expenses of any prisoners released from Federal prison.        And it seems to me that statute, combined with a letter to the elected governor, who probably wants to be re-elected, or the elected attorney general, will make it pretty certain that the State will take over the responsibility for the individual.        Don't -- don t States have involuntary commitment procedures?        Now, couldn't the Federal Government fund a Federal -- would you find a constitutional problem in the Federal Government funding an office which brings involuntary commitment proceedings in a State where a prisoner is released when the Federal Government believes --        -- the prisoner is unsafe?        And I presume the State couldn't -- if the -- if the Court says commitment is proper, the State would have to accept the commitment, no?        So why don't they do that?        Yes, but most of the argument for why this is constitutional is simply it's necessary, and therefore it's constitutional.                But I'm not even sure it's necessary.          Where do they send them? The last residence where --
08-1301 +++$+++           Where -- where -- where? (2)(A)?   Which is where?          I see.        Or  --          And they don't have to travel in interstate commerce.          Right.          How long ago --          I don't know where you get that from.     I can understand how you can say, which is what Mr. Rothfeld says, that it has to follow the requirement to register.        That's the way the statute reads:   Whoever, one, is required to register, not whoever has committed an offense that -- that would later justify registration.           It seems to me you are just making up the -- the prior act that -- that triggers the interstate travel requirement.          Well, what text do you base it on?   (1) says "is required to register," and the position of the Petitioner is:            After you are required to register, you must travel in interstate commerce. And you say:     No, it's after you commit the offense that you must travel in interstate.            Where do you get that from?            No, but -- but it doesn't, because if you haven't been -- if you are convicted of a Federal offense, you are automatically in, but if you are convicted of a State offense, you re in only if you travel in interstate commerce after that offense.            So you don't resolve the inconsistency between (A) and (B). There is still going to be some inconsistency between the two.           Exactly.            That -- that s a much less powerful point.    There is inconsistency between (A) and (B), no matter what you do.          Yes, where -- where it means prior travel, it says so, use of a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.              They use the past tense when they mean it.
08-1314 +++$+++        I don't understand that, and I looked for a diagram.     It talked about the center seat, aisle seat -       Do you know what the terminology is?       Where is it?       The aisle was not between the two seats?       Why didn't they prohibit it, if they were so sure about that?     They allowed it, didn't they?       Why shouldn't we allow the juries to take account of those changes over time?       I mean, as you say, the agency's rule only spoke of the situation at that time.
08-1322 +++$+++              Okay, let's take the regulation:     "A person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of the payment."              Ultimately, isn't it the plaintiff who has recovered that is entitled to the benefit, because this money is given to him in order that he can meet a financial obligation that he owes to the lawyer? I mean, if this didn't exist, he'd owe the lawyer and have to pony it up out of his own pocket, no?             And in those cases, you agree the offset can be made?              Well, you say that in Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept pay-as-you-go?     Is --              But that doesn't mean that there is not either an express or an implied contract between the attorney and the Social Security recipient.              Well, but if there is that implied contract, then it is an obligation of the recipient.              Well, I don't see how that leads you where you want to go.                 Then the payment given to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by -- by paying off an obligation that the Social Security recipient has.             I thought the -- I thought the government said they only did that when -- when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney.
08-1332 +++$+++              Mr. Dammeier, you could say the same thing about private phones.                      There are obviously circumstances in which whether you were making a call between certain times becomes relevant to litigation.    So you could say that destroys the expectation of privacy?         I'm not sure.               I hope we don't say that.               Well, to say that there s an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an unreasonable one.     There could be that expectation of privacy and, still, for some reason -- let's assume there has been a theft in the building, and it's known that what was taken has not gotten out of the building.              It's conceivable that that would be a valid reason to intrude upon the expectation of privacy, right?             Well, why isn't this a proper circumstance?              They didn't know which ones were private messages, did they?             Not until they read them.              Did -- did he know about that statute?    I didn't know about it.              Can we assume he didn't?              And what difference would that make?              I don t see how it can affect his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it.             Ignorance of the law is no excuse, is what you re saying?              Well, what -- when you send a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware that that text message will remain confidential only to the extent that either the recipient keeps it confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody else who has power over the recipient or over the recipient's phone chooses to look at it?                Don't -- isn't that understood when you send somebody a text message?              Well, so she should have understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of his phone lawfully can read the message.                  In other words, I don't see that she's in a -- in a different position from Quon himself.              Well, that's a different issue.               You mean it doesn't go right to the other thing? (Laughter.)               Can you print these things out?   Could Quon print these -- these spicy conversations out and circulate them among his buddies?               Well --             Yes, I didn't know.               Suppose I sent somebody a letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and let's assume it s intercepted at the Post Office, but I have also published the letter in a letter to the editor of the newspaper.    I have written the following letter to Sergeant Quon.    Do I still have a right -- a right of privacy in that letter?                Well, but that's the situation here.     The -- the central location that stores the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the message public effectively by sending it to Quon.                       Once it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public or that the employer can -- can find out about it.                Right.                Exactly.         That -- and that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are effectively making it public by sending it to somebody whom you don't know is immune from disclosure.                     So, in order to stop the intermediary from making it public, you needed the statute.          Otherwise you wouldn't need it; the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right?
08-1341 +++$+++              Address the test used by the Second Circuit.     That's what we re concerned about.             And that's what the question pertained to.       They re using a test nobody else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior opinions.   Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them, you know, use the right test?           Well, you call it an ex post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with the government; it's a due process violation.           -- what happened is improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre- -- pre-statute conduct.     But it might have been evidence that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason. That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation. What is special about the fact that the reason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was that it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the statute?           And when a State court allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State court judgment.   But that's not what occurred here. What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction, which it should not have let the jury consider. And there s a lot of evidence that a court should not have let the jury consider.             I don't see anything particularly special about fact that the reason this evidence shouldn t have been before the jury was that it occurred before the statute.          And -- and, therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.          There s also no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of the Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law shall be passed.          You don't have -- you don t have an ex post facto law that was passed here. You have an incorrect jury charge.        You have the judge telling the jury that you could convict on the basis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't. That is not an ex post facto law.             I m looking for Marks, where is that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?             You have mentioned several times the Marks case.      What case is --             Where is that?             Is it in your brief?             I mean, see, I don't know what that case is.    If it was a case in which we reversed a State supreme court because the State supreme court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could say that was an ex post facto violation through the Fourteenth Amendment.          Okay.        This -- this evidence was improper because if the legislature had made that action punishable when it occurred before the statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.         Now, in fact, the legislature didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.              But we do have the admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted, which is no different from evidence that should have not been admitted for some other reason. For example, where the -- where the court gives an instruction that permits evidence to be considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is irrelevant to the crime.        And the jury says you can find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with the crime. Why is this any different from that?            It's just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed to use for conviction.       I don't see why there is anything special about the fact that the reason it shouldn't be used for conviction --          -- is because it occurred pre-statute.          Courtesy -- courtesy of Justice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks case.   And the -- the summary of the case at the beginning says:      Petitioners were convicted of transporting obscene materials in violation of the Federal statute.       Held:      The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to petitioners of the Miller standards. It was a due process case.          And, therefore, the Due Process Clause was violated when the court let that in.          So you -- you have to persuade us that there is something special about a violation of the Due Process Clause that lets in evidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations that let in other evidence that should not properly be used to convict the defendant.            And I frankly don't -- don't see why it's so special.
08-1371 +++$+++               That is not an implementation of the nondiscrimination policy.                     I mean, the two policies are quite different.                     Now, are you telling us that the written policy is no longer operative?              No, what?        No, it's not operative or no, you re not telling me that? (Laughter.)                Well, they stipulated that the policy exists.      They didn't stipulate that it is -- is being faithfully applied by Hastings.                    What do you do about the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws referred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which clearly do -- conflict with the so-called all-comers policy?                All of the bylaws --                Yes.              Well, they don t say that.              They don't say that.              The -- the two are connected, though, Mr. Garre.      Frankly, one reason why I am inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to officership.     To require this Christian society to allow atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes, right?    That's crazy. (Laughter.)              And is there any other university in the country that has this kind of a policy?              Where is that?             Wait, wait, wait.   Twenty years?    Do you have any evidence that this policy, the one we re arguing about now, that is to say, the all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this litigation?     As I recall, the only evidence in the record is a letter from the dean describing this policy after the litigation began.               Teach Bible classes? Right?               You have to let them teach Bible classes, too, right?              Where -- yes, let's get back to this homosexual orientation.                 You say that that's established in the case.             Can I ask about number 2, the -- the so-called line-drawing problem?                 Aren't you just letting yourself into even more line-drawing problems?             I mean, the other -- it s whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of the forbidden bases.      But now you re saying you can't discriminate on any basis, which means there re going to be even more lines to have to draw.                 Why does it solve your problem?
08-1394 +++$+++        Well, suppose you have a statute that -- that makes it criminal to -- to do any bad thing, okay?   Now it's clear that murder would be covered.   All right?   Nobody would say that murder is not covered by that.    Does -- does that make the statute non-vague?          I mean, just because you can pick something that everybody would agree comes within a denial of honest services, doesn't -- doesn't mean that when you say nothing but honest services, you re saying something that -- that has sufficient content to -- to support a criminal prosecution.          And there were cases that -- that -- some of which included bribery, but others of which included a variety of -- of other actions, some of which were allowed by some courts and some of which were disallowed by some courts.           There was no solid content to what MCNally covered.           But it's circular, isn't it?          I'm sorry.     The duty of an employee to provide honest services to his employer -- that's not included because the employee is not a fiduciary?          Where do you get the fiduciary limitation?          All it says is "honest services."   I would think that --          -- any employee has the obligation to provide honest services.          That doesn't give me a whole lot of comfort, I mean, just because there s an intent to deceive.     An intent to deceive can be the basis for -- for terminating a contract.                 There's -- there's been fraud in the inducement or something of that sort. So I know I m liable to have the contract terminated, and maybe for damages for the contract.                And you say:   And also, by the way, you know, you can go to jail for a number of years, because, oh, yes, it's very vague, but you intended to deceive, and that's all -- that's all you need to know.
08-1402 +++$+++         Excuse me.          You -- if that statement is true, then -- then there is -- there s no third part to the three-part test.                 I thought Duren established a three-part test.        And the third one was that you had to establish -- after having already established the disparity, you had to establish that there was a selection process which caused the disparity.     And you are telling us that you don't have to proceed to step 3.        Once you show the disparity, it is assumed that it is the product of the system.        How do you reconcile that with the third test?     Please tell me how you reconcile that statement with the fact that it did set forth a three -- a three-prong test.        Mr. Sterling, I don't -- you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the pool a disproportionate number of people. Why -- why do you have to prove that?              If Grand Rapids contributes to the pool an inordinate, disproportionate number of the minority -- blacks in this case -- even if Grand Rapids simply took back a proportionate number from the pool, it would still have a disproportionate effect on reducing the number of blacks in the overall pool, wouldn't it?        But a step -- a step in the right direction is not enough.            You were adducing that to prove that the prior system had a significant effect, and it turned out, it didn't have a very significant effect.     It doesn't prove your point to say, well, it's a step in the right direction. If it's insignificant, it's insignificant. Whether it's insignificant in the right direction or the wrong direction doesn't matter.        I still don't -- I don't understand this problem of -- of you have to show that they took back more than they contributed. Let's assume that Grand Rapids is -- is entirely black, and its entire delegation that goes to the pool are all black, okay?          And let's assume that those blacks are 10 percent of the -- the totality, and there are no blacks from anywhere else, okay? Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10 percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents. All of the other districts would thereby have zero percent blacks instead of 10 percent, which is what they ought to have.        Exactly.        Exactly.         So why expect the other districts to have 10 percent blacks simply because Grand Rapids contributed 10 percent of the totality, all of whom were black?            There -- then there s a requirement for each district to have 10 percent blacks, right?      But if Grand Rapids takes back its -- its -- the people it sent, there are no more blacks left to go around.
08-1423 +++$+++        It seems to me -- why didn't they say -- instead of "lawfully made under this title," why didn't they just say "made in the United States"?       I mean, that's what you say it means.     "Made under this title" means "made in the United States."       That's just not in the text.     I mean, like the other side, in order to make your theory of the text appear reasonable, you have to bring in a skyhook with a limitation that finds no basis in the text.       But you don't say that. I mean, you bring in this other qualification.       But it would be lawfully made under this title, even though it was made -- you know, made abroad, if what?       Is isn't the making that is rendered lawful.     It's the importation into the United States that is rendered lawful by the agreement that you are relying upon.

I -- I gather you don't believe that the First Amendment reads:     Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech except those that make sense.     Is that -       And doing it.       Well, what -- what about a law that says you can't sell to minors a video game - it doesn't care what the plot is, but no video game in which the minor commits violent acts of maiming, killing, setting people on fire?     What about that? Would that -- would that be regulating speech?       It's not speech.     You're saying you just can't let the kid maim -- maim, kill -       -- or set on fire.     What the law would be directed at is not the plot, not the video game itself, but the child's act of -- of committing murder, maiming, and so forth.       The child is speaking to the game?       Well, and you started Ginsberg with something that is proscribable even with regard to adults.       You know that there is such a thing as -- as obscenity, which can be proscribed even -- even as to adults; whereas in this case, I don't know that there's such a thing as morbid violence which could be eliminated from ordinary movies.
08-1457 +++$+++              Just before the third member no longer became -- no longer was a member of the board.             So knowing when it gave it to this three member panel that it would shortly become a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be able to act with only two members instead of with three, which is what the quorum requirement for the board is. I must say that seems to be a very strange procedure when you have a statute that says the board has to -- has to have three for a quorum.              When the board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy who's about to go off.      It will immediately become a two-member panel and then we can act with only two members.     That's wonderful. It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement?             Well, don't -- don't you think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause that you were discussing -- where is it?                    It's in (b). "A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board."    And it says nothing about a vacancy in the group not impairing the power of the group.             Which -- which buttresses, it seems to me, the argument that when the group is no longer a group of three the delegation is no longer effective.             Of the board.             But it doesn't say that about the group.    That's my point.             No.      The -- this whole passage distinguishes between the board and the group. I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group when it says "the board" and the board when it says "the group."              I'm sorry.             The quorum for the group should be three, then.         Right?             It depends.          I mean, if shutting down is the only way to put pressure on Congress to -- I mean, you may have a Congress that is just delighted to have only two Democratic members left on the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic members.     What possible incentive does that Congress have to increase the board to -- to the level that it should be?     None. If you want to solve the crisis that you are so worried about, the only way to solve it is to say: Boy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we are going to not be able to act at all.                     That would solve the crisis.               I'm much more impressed by -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think you have contradicted, that for many years whenever there was a death in one of the three-member panels, that panel was reconstituted.             A new person was appointed, instead of just letting it continue to operate with only two.       Doesn't that mean something? Doesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by the board as requiring three people?             But they never did it when they had a full board?             Whenever there was a death of one of the members of a three-judge panel or a three-member panel, they filled it and the panel did not operate with two?             Even though it could have, even though the quorum provision was just as it is here.             Those panels did not operate with two?             When -- when -- when is one of the two's term over?             Of this year.       At which point there will be some pressure on Congress, I guess, right?

08-1470 +++$+++           It depends on what you -- what you need to make "it," it depends on what "it" is. If -- if you mean the ultimate confession, I think I don't agree.     Ultimately, if he confesses and hasn't been coerced, it's voluntary. But if by the "it" you mean to make the continuation of the interrogation voluntary, that's a different question.     And I don't know that our cases establish that you cannot continue the interrogation until there has been a waiver.          But does that make it clear that -- that there has to be a waiver before the interrogation can continue?           And if it does, how does it square with Butler?          They re both under -- they re both under Miranda.           Both of those rights are Miranda rights.          It was read to him.          And they had him read a portion of the Miranda warning.          Huh?          What?          Yes, they had him read --          So I -- boy, I -- what more do you need?          I mean, he -- he s listening when -- when they read it to him.           He -- he -- he can read it himself.          Maybe -- maybe he doesn't want to talk for the moment, but he does want to listen. I'm not sure you re doing defendants a great -- a great favor.    I mean, some of them might want to listen to -- to the police telling them, you know, by the way, your co-conspirator is singing like a bird and he's trying to pin it all on you, and maybe, you know, if -- if you don't want to get left holding the bag, maybe you d better to talk to us and tell us what really happened. I'm not sure that -- that if I were there, even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what this person did.     He could have said, I don't want to -- I don't want talk. And it -- and it would have ended.                 That would have been an assertion of his right.                 He didn't assert his right, but --             -- he -- he sat there and listened.   Now, maybe he wanted to find out what the police would have to say to him.           Of course, those facts are relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and interrogation must cease immediately.              If we agree with that, then all of these facts become relevant.              But if we think that, until you invoke the right, the police can continue to ask you questions and it's up to you to answer or not, then those facts are really not relevant at all, are they? I think that's true.           It wasn't meant to be a trick question.           On your theory, those -- those factual things are irrelevant, whether --          Exactly, exactly.          I must say I've never understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's generally understood to be the law, that unless you get a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to terminate interrogation.      I think there are a lot of police departments that don't -- I've never understood that to be the rule.           I'm not saying it isn't a good rule.    It may be a good rule.               But the issue here is whether it is so clearly established that it was unreasonable for the State court to think otherwise.           I like clear rules.        Your rule is a clear one.     Another clear one would be just the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can continue unless he asserts his right.                That's another clear rule.     We can go either way, and it will be clear.           But he doesn't answer.       He just sits there --           -- impassively.           Then they have to stop?          Wait.        Excuse me.     A waiver of what?   I thought the Chief Justice was talking about a waiver of your right to remain silent.          That wasn't a waiver --          -- of his right to remain silent.          I'm willing to talk to you, I'm willing to listen to you.          It seems to me you re confusing a -- a waiver of -- of the right to remain silent with a waiver of the right not to be interrogated, which is the right that you are asserting here, a right not to be interrogated, unless going in you say, I waive my right to remain silent.               That's -- that's the new right that you are asserting.          A right not to be interrogated.

You know, I would have guessed that you are providing a service or personnel when you make yourself a member of the organization. Why do you say Congress clearly did not intend it?           Well, Mohammed Atta and his harmonica quartet might tour the country and make a lot of money.    Right?           Why do these hypotheticals make any difference?   This is an as-applied challenge. We should look to the activities that this organization wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there is an overbreadth problem.        And that seems to me -- I'm not even sure that the Petitioners assert that here. Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this statute is -- is constitutional, and whatever aspects of speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal.           That being the case, of what relevance are these hypotheticals?   It's a lot of fun, and it's very interesting, but we can deal with all of that when the situations arise, can't we?           Unless you're in an overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an as-applied challenge.    A statute can be vague as applied to certain conduct, although the core conduct that it covers is clearly covered.           We have cases like that.
08-1521 +++$+++           When is the last time an opinion of ours made that the test, implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?         It sounds very nice.       But when is the last time we used it?            I think it was 1937.          Has it been the basis of our decision in any case since Palko?          Is the right to trial by jury implicit in the concept of ordered liberty?          My goodness --          -- there are a lot of countries that don't give the right to trial by jury, even England does not give it in all criminal cases.            That may be --            That may be the reason it was put there.    But it was put there.            And that's the crucial fact. It is either there or it is not there. And if it's there, it doesn't seem to me to make any difference why they chose to put that one there as opposed to other ones that they didn't put there. It's either there or not.           Yes.            I -- I don't understand.           What basis would there be to -- to deny that?           Firearms kill people is what the States say, and -- and we ban it.           Other countries have done that.           But if they did do it, I think you d have to say it's perfectly okay.          Yes.     The reason is guns are dangerous.           They said that is the reason it was codified.      They did not say that that is the function of what was codified.               The function of what was codified was to enforce the traditional right of the people to bear arms.           And to say that that wasn't the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about what it consists of.          Mr. Feldman, let me take your argument at -- at its face value.           Let's assume that the only reason it is there and the only purpose it serves is the militia purpose.          Isn't that militia purpose just as much defeated by allowing the States to take away the militia's arms as it would be by allowing the Federal Government to take away the militia's arms?          Then so --          -- even if you assume that the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to the State's depriving the people of arms.          You re switching horses now.          Let's just focus on your argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue. You say this is different because of that prologue.           But that prologue has just as much force if the States take away the militia's arms as if the Federal Government does.             Eleven of the colonies had a guarantee at the time the Constitution was adopted, and I believe something like 44 States currently have in their constitutions protection of the right to bear arms.             Does that suggest anything about -- about how fundamental it is generally?          "Subject to such regulation" certainly excludes banning them entirely, which is what you assert can be done.          What's the purpose of a State constitutional guarantee which has at the end of it "subject to such regulation as the legislature may proscribe," if that regulation includes banning it entirely?   That --             -- would make a nullity of the constitutional requirement.             And is that what you re asserting here --             -- that the States have to allow firearms?             Is that --             I didn't think so, either, so --             -- why does your last argument make any sense?          That's fine.          We said as much in Heller.          Handguns in the home?          Handguns in the home? That's what Heller addressed.          No, you can't, because they didn't.          See, the right to keep and bear arms is right there.       It's right there in the Bill of Rights.   Where do you find the right to self-defense?          You -- you want us to impose that one on the States but not -- not the explicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms. That seems very strange.          The District of Columbia did.   That s what Heller said.          What you re urging is really a mixed blessing for gun control advocates.          To the extent we sever the Federal guarantee from what the States are obliged to comport with, we encourage a stricter Federal Second Amendment, one that forbids all sorts of regulations that the Federal Government might otherwise be allowed to do, because it doesn't matter -- the States can take care of it. I mean, you know, if -- if you sever the two, you re encouraging a broader prohibition at the Federal level, and that's what -- Heller was very careful not to impose such a broad prohibition precisely because it realized that -- that this is a national problem.
08-1529 +++$+++           You claim the Westfall Act implicitly repealed 233(a)?           Is that what you say?          Well, that provision says that it's exclusive, and you re saying the Westfall Act says it s not exclusive.          But it isn't just made superfluous.     It is repealed.          The provision of it that says "it shall be exclusive" is repealed.          Implicitly, because it's not specifically referred to.           Well, you say any -- any other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this civil action existed, so that it only covered those causes of action that existed at the time the statute was passed?           Why?     Why?   I mean, if your theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to say it's precluded?           Legislative history will do, so -- so we don't require this clear statement, right?           Legislative history will do the job, so you re abandoning the -- the proposition that there has to be a clear statement by Congress.           That's what you said.     I thought you said if -- if it was clear from the legislative history that Congress considered Bivens actions and nonetheless enacted language similar to 233(a), that wouldn't be enough.           Is -- is -- is important what Congress was thinking or what Congress said?            I thought your proposition was, unless the statute says that it bans constitutional actions, it doesn't.            Is that your proposition?          Then it doesn't matter what Congress was thinking, does it?           Unless Congress says that, your -- your position is --          But, ah, but if it doesn't unambiguously bar it, you can then look to legislative history and say although it didn't bar it, the legislative history shows that it was intended to bar it.          You are abandoning Carlson then.         I thought Carlson was your big case.          You just abandoned its proposition that there has to be a statement in the statute.

You say we have to defer to a letter --          -- brief in another case? I think most of my colleagues would not defer to a letter brief in this case.        And you re saying that we owe deference to a letter brief in another case?          Mead, which I didn't agree with, it seems to me --          In another case?          In that case.         Do we have a brief here?         Right.           Can I ask you a question about -- about whether -- whether the shipper becomes a rail carrier?   Suppose it's not 3 to 5 miles. Suppose the -- suppose the American rail carrier is waiting right at the foot of the wharf, and all these wharves have rails that go out to the ship, okay? And let's assume that that's owned by the -- by the shipping company.    And a crane takes the -- the goods off of the ship, puts it on a -- on a car that rides along those rails for a couple of hundred yards. Is that enough to make the shipper a railroad?           And you say here they own rail lines that --           -- that go for --
08-1555 +++$+++           Ms. Millett, I think it's a pretty empty statute as well to interpret the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to immunize the Department of Defense, but not the Secretary of Defense.                 I mean, that seems very strange.          The -- the Ministry of Defense is not the whole, either.             I mean, you -- you acknowledge that -- that each individual piece of a foreign sovereign acquires the immunity, but somehow not -- not the principal officers of -- of the sovereign entity.   That seems to me very strange.              I mean, I guess -- I guess you could write it that way, but I don't know why anybody would want to write it that way.           Excuse me.        The -- the mechanism it provides is judicial determination of these questions that -- that you say have to be determined -- whether he was acting within the scope of authority and all that stuff.         Isn't that what it did? It took it away from the Executive, gave it --           No, I gather the --             -- the State Department asserts the right to say:          Yes, he was acting in a -- in an official capacity, but sock it to him.             I mean, the -- the State Department wants to be able to decide whether individuals will be held liable, whether they were acting in an official capacity or not; isn't that it?         I must say --           -- that I find it much more acceptable to have the State Department say that a particular foreign country should be let off the hook, which is what they used to do with the Tate letters, than I do to leave it up to the State Department whether -- whether an individual human being shall be -- shall be punished or not.             I -- I somehow find that less within the realm of the -- of the foreign affairs power of the State Department.          That's -- that's very nice. A few years ago, a Spanish magistrate allowed a lawsuit to proceed, as I recall, against our Secretary of Defense. And what you say is that that's perfectly okay.                It's up to the Spanish government to assert that that suit should not proceed, and if it doesn't, it's perfectly okay?           There were a lot of long sentences in there -- (Laughter.)

I agree with you. (Laughter.)        And you believe there is a background of life sentence?         You agree with the government that --        Well, it either is or isn't.   You --            There must be some statutory provision that you -- that you -- that you rely upon.            Where does 7 years come from?          The prior statute -- which was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right?

08-192 +++$+++                  Not just that, he gets a felony on his record.        Before that he would have had just a misdemeanor; right?              Counsel, what do you do -- this case that I find pretty close to what we have here is Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that prohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote, "promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate" certain kinds of illegal activities, one of which would have been gambling. And we said the ordinary meaning of this language suggests that the traveler's purpose must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity.    So it wouldn't have been facilitating a gambling operation simply to be engaging in interstate travel for the purpose of playing the tables.              Oh, it certainly focused on the word "facilitate."        That was the whole purpose of that passage.    It said -- it quoted "promote, manage, establish, carry on or facilitate," and the ordinary meaning of this language suggests the traveler's purpose must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity.             Don't you think that the "knowingly" in this statute also requires that you are knowingly facilitating?             Okay.       So this is the same thing here.             Well, this didn't mention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either, did it?             I find it pretty close, I really do.              Except that the use of a phone in this statute is applied to the seller as well as to the buyer.     I mean, it seems to me it is parallel: use of a phone to commit the offense by the seller, and you want us to similarly sweep in the facilitating of the offense by the use of the phone by the buyer.              It seems to me pretty parallel to what we've done in the buyer-seller rule.                Let's feel sorry for this -- for the felon who is selling this stuff, too.                I mean, the same thing is true of him, isn't it?              Every time he makes another phone call he gets socked with another how many years?                Yes, so four times four times four every time he makes a phone call.                We should feel sorry for him, too.
08-205 +++$+++                 Wait, wait, wait, wait.      We never questioned it, but we never approved it, either. And we gave some really weird interpretations to the Taft-Hartley Act in order to avoid confronting the question.             I don't understand what you are saying.    I mean, we are not a self -- self-starting institution here.     We only disapprove of something when somebody asks us to.       And if there was no occasion for us to approve or disapprove, it proves nothing whatever that we didn't disapprove it.             Let's -- let's talk about overbreadth.    You've -- let's assume that that is a valid interest.     What percentage of the total number of corporations in the country are not single shareholder corporations?     The local hairdresser, the local auto repair shop, the local new car dealer -- I don't know any small business in this country that isn't incorporated, and the vast majority of them are sole-shareholder-owned. Now this statute makes it unlawful for all of them to do the things that you are worried about, you know, distorting other -- the interests of other shareholders.    That is vast overbreadth.              I'm not talking about the corruption interest.       You -- you have your quid pro quo argument, that's another one.              We get to that when we get there.    But as far as the interest you are now addressing, which is those shareholders who don't agree with this political position are being somehow cheated, that doesn't apply probably to the vast majority of corporations in this country.               So that can't be the justification --               -- because if it were, the statute would be vastly overbroad.               Congress has a self-interest.   I mean, we -- we are suspicious of congressional action in the First Amendment area precisely because we -- at least I am -- I doubt that one can expect a body of incumbents to draw election restrictions that do not favor incumbents.              Now is that excessively cynical of me?           I don't think so.             General Kagan, most -- most corporations are indistinguishable from the individual who owns them, the local hairdresser, the new auto dealer -- dealer who has just lost his dealership and -- and who wants to oppose whatever Congressman he thinks was responsible for this happening or whatever Congressman won't try to patch it up by -- by getting the auto company to undo it.            There is no distinction between the individual interest and the corporate interest.   And that is true for the vast majority of corporations.             Yet this law freezes all of them out.             Oh, he wants to put up a sign --             What happened to the overbreadth doctrine?      I mean, I thought our doctrine in the Fourth Amendment is if you write it too broadly, we are not going to pare it back to the point where it's constitutional.   If it's overbroad, it's invalid.           What has happened to that.             So you're -- you are a lawyer advising somebody who is about to come out with a book and you say don't worry, the FEC has never tried to send somebody to prison for this.                This statute covers it, but don't worry, the FEC has never done it.                Is that going to comfort your client?            I don't think so.             Great aggregations of wealth.   The brief by the Chamber of Commerce, the amicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce points out that 96 percent of its members employ less than 100 people. These are not aggregations of great wealth.            You are not talking about the railroad barons and the rapacious trusts of the Elihu Root era; you are talking mainly about small business corporations.             I don't understand that answer.   I mean, if that's what you were concerned about, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could have said all corporations that have a net worth of more than, you know, so much or whatever.                   That is not what Congress did.   It said all corporations.
08-214 +++$+++               Well, why -- why does joining it to a Jones Act case help?               Do you think Stewart knew more about these -- these obscure, ancient cases than we do?               Do you think he knew more about these obscure, ancient cases than we do?               Had he had the benefit of briefs by Professor Robertson and -- I think not, right?               It was just sort of off the top of his head that he thought there should be punitive damages.               They -- they normally are, but the question is whether there -- whether this -- this is a different quiver.             We've abandoned that.             Exactly.         We've abandoned that in this hearing.      We said what we do with these admiralty causes of action we should be guided by what Congress has done in the Death on the High Seas Act and the Jones Act. Do you acknowledge that there are no punitive damages available in the event of death?              Well, that -- you want to talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a sensible system.   In the days when Massachusetts used to have a -- when I was in law school, they had a compensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for pain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was back her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not quite dead yet. (Laughter.)              Is -- is -- is this going to be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive damages?              Yeah, but it is invited, isn't it?                It certainly makes these maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the plaintiffs' bar doesn't it?              I mean, one of your complaints is there's just no money in it.                The claim is not for that much.                Of course it shouldn't be the goal.   But we're inquiring into the question of whether granting punitive damages will increase or decrease the number of lawsuits. I -- I -- I would think it would be astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.              I wish it were as clearcut as that.   I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I should have had this very expensive treatment?            And the ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is not necessary. Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim? I bet it is.              He's going to say that was willful and wanton.     I obviously needed this more expensive treatment.      He just didn't want to pay the money.
08-22 +++$+++                I don't think we adopted his principle, did we, in the obscenity area?             Of course the appearance standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable.               Once it is clearly established that a certain -- certain set of facts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is solidly established, then the set of facts right next to that suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety because it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously improper.   And -- and so we go down and down and down. And I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule that is a sliding scale like that.             We have no choice with regard to the reasonableness standard.                 We -- it's not a standard we made up.             -- as we would have been making up this one.     It's there in the Constitution.             We have to make the most of it, do the best we can do with it.                 But here we're being urged to adopt out of nowhere a new standard of probability of bias.      That's not in the Constitution, and it's perfectly valid to ask, is that a sensible standard?             Are you going to finally get to discussing the debt of gratitude point?             I've been waiting and waiting. (Laughter.)              It doesn't matter what language you use because it's pretty vague anyway -- "probability," "likelihood," "appearance" -- it doesn't really --              I'm really anxious to hear what you have to say on debt of gratitude.
08-240 +++$+++            Well, the franchisor stops delivering gas.   There are three -- three different obligations under the contract.             What does the franchisee have to do to show that he has accepted it as a termination?    Why does he have to leave the premises? That's another contract, is -- is what the --        Up -- up to that point, which supposedly a jury can find, the tipping point where a reasonable franchisee would abandon -- up until then, he has a contract claim, right?               And then at that magical point, the contract claim is converted into a claim under the statute?         Why isn't the contract claim alone enough?         "In the context of termination" is what the statute says.         What background principles were they?     I don't know about constructive termination. There was constructive discharge and constructive eviction.     But --         What do you do about the claim of -- of the -- the Petitioners that only one of the three contracts has been terminated?         The other two continue -- continue in effect?           Of course, your -- your approach puts -- puts the company -- the oil company in a very strange position.        It doesn't know whether it has a contract or not.    It -- the contract is terminated if your client says it's terminated.              If he doesn't say it's terminated, it's not terminated.              I mean, a very weird contract where you -- you re subject to the whim of the other party as to whether the contract continues or not.        Well, I don't know.      They -- you know, if they knew that they were pulling out and -- and were claiming a termination, they might have been looking for somebody else to take over the franchise.
08-267 +++$+++                What do you mean, "they must"?   Do you think it's unconstitutional to deprive them of that?               That's what you mean by "they must have"?               That's fine, but -- but is it unconstitutional for Congress to say military courts are different, they've always been different, the need for finality is greater there, and we're conducting a different rule for there?              Oh, oh, oh, so it would be unconstitutional if they did not leave in its place an adequate and effective substitute --              -- which would cover every situation no matter how fanciful, right?               Did -- did coram nobis relief -- you say it has to be there.                     Was it ever used before in the military courts?               Indeed, yes.               Worse still.     My goodness. So you were --               -- convicted by a court-martial and had no basis for -- for getting that revised, and that -- that lasted for a couple of hundred years, right?    And that was okay or it wasn't okay?               Well, that's fine.     I mean, you can patch it up and say that they thought it wasn't a good idea to have just military courts.                But it's very hard to make the constitutional argument you're making when for a couple hundred years in military, in military courts, which are different, there -- there was no relief at all.             And you were saying it is. Just say, no, it's not constitutionally compelled and I'll be happy. (Laughter.)             I don't think it's much of a lurk when for 200 years this was going on.                It's not lurking to my mind.              Was that person retried, do you know?                Was he still in the military?               It's talking about somebody still within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote correctly, right?
08-289 +++$+++               Can I ask whether the requirements of the EEOA are at all affected by Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act?     I mean, you know, it's a very vague requirement that you make a good faith effort to -- to provide language assistance to children. Why shouldn't the courts decide that what constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what Congress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child Left Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are doing okay?              Okay.       I would call that good faith, but that's fine.               That's fine.               What -- what page is this?              What degree --              What degree of improvement do you think is necessary?           Do you agree with the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit says, "We cannot say the district court clearly erred when it found this burden was not met.   A district in which the majority of ELL tenth graders failed to meet State achievement standards while the majority of native English speakers passed is not one whose performance demonstrates that the State is adequately funding ELL programs." Do you really think that you haven't complied with adequate funding of ELL programs until you raise all of the ELL students up to the level of native English speakers?               Well, that's all this says. The majority doesn't --               -- doesn't meet the -- a majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the standards, but the majority of native English speakers do.             Counsel, I --             I find it bizarre that we are sitting here talking about what the whole State has to do on the basis of one district which is concededly the district that has the most nonnative English speakers and has been a problem district all along.               And we are saying whatever this district court says for -- for this school district applies statewide.              Now, that is bizarre.             And the mere fact that the State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind of a system at the outset, does that force us to still accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?             I'll let --             I'll let Arizona worry about that.    It's -- it's another matter to have a district court decree that the whole State has to do this thing.    And whether -- whether it's done equally or not would be a matter for the State courts to determine, instead of for this district judge to determine, right?             Right but --             I understand that.           You could get the plan approved and then not fund it.                     But at least the additional funding demanded by the district court should be whatever additional funding is necessary to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act.                     Right?             Well, then -- then it's not as simple as you made it.          Of course, I agree with the fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that -- that won't satisfy your obligation.                     But if you have gotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying your obligation should be how much money would it cost to implement the program that you have gotten approved under the No Child Left Behind Act.              It doesn't approve programs?              I thought the States had to submit a program.              Right.           Right.              So you are saying you can't calculate costs.              You cannot calculate costs under the plan approved by the Secretary --              -- because all the plan is is testing.              Okay.              Ms. Saharsky, I have one late arriving question.         Do you think that the constitutional -- State constitutional provision at least there has to be equivalent funding in districts, do you think that would be called into play if the Federal Government under a federal program gave additional funds to a particular district?               Which I am sure it does, those districts that have federal facilities probably get additional -- additional money, would all the rest -- under this constitutional provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly up to that -- to that same level?              I doubt it.              Yeah.              Well, if federal funding doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable only to a particular school district count?
08-295 +++$+++ 
08-304 +++$+++              Why -- why should we read the second category back to alter the meaning of the first, rather than reading the first phrase forward to alter the meaning of the second?                 It -- it is absolutely clear when you read this, "in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing"; there is no limitation to Federal on that.     And you acknowledge that the criminal and civil apply to -- to State civil and criminal proceedings, right?       So when you read that phrase, "administrative" simply means, obviously means State administrative. Now, why shouldn't I read that forward and say, well, since it means State there, it must mean State in the next one, in a congressional, administrative, or GAO report.               You say that just as to administrative.     Don't you acknowledge that the criminal and civil apply to State criminal and civil?               You want the whole thing to be just Federal?               The whole category?             News media, they are likely to be keeping track of all local newspapers as well?               I mean, they could have said "national news media."             It didn't say "national news media."   It said "news media."               It includes a local radio station, a local community newspaper, right?             All of that is included.               And yet, State proceedings, which are excluded, right?               Even state supreme court cases and so forth.      It seems strange to me.              That doesn't show that it makes sense.    It just shows that Congress wasn't thinking clearly.     There's as difference between the two.             Which decision of ours do you think would prompt Congress to go back and do this right?   I mean, do you think that finding the way the government wants us to find will produce a revision of this really terrible text so that it makes sense; or do you think that finding for the other side, giving the government some incentive to get this fixed, would likely produce a proper amendment?                What do you think? I think the latter, to tell you the truth.               Could you be more specific when you say that Congress had in mind?                      Just so I know what you are talking about?               The committee that reported the bill.               In both houses or just one house?               The House.              Is the Justice Department seeking to get this -- this piece of -- of statutory text clarified?    I mean, you do have some operation over there that proposes to Congress amendments of those provisions that are not working out well.                     Is there -- is there any effort to get this clarified?              Could it make it worse? (Laughter.)               Of course, the Attorney General can always bring suit, right?                     I mean, all we are arguing about is whether this information that is in the in the State and local thing could be the basis of a qui tam suit.               If the government finds out about it, the Attorney General could always bring suit, right?
08-305 +++$+++               Except that you are reading (C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say.                It just says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free appropriate public education available.              And you read it to say you must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't say that.   It -- it's a safe harbor for the school district.   It says, so long as you've made an appropriate public education available, you can't be liable for any -- any private school tuition. Now, you want to expand that to say, and whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable. But it really doesn't say that.               And -- and the later sections suggest that it meant not to say that.                Yes, but if -- if you avoid that collaborative relationship entirely and just run off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you get reimbursement.      Why?                Why would Congress -- huh?                I'm not following this.       I don't know what section.              Are any of these other procedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to be provided by the school district, not -- not by the hearing officer.              But it doesn't say hearing officers.     "An opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification" --              -- to present the complaint to the principal.              And it might make also sense to say that if the hearing officer has no authority to award a certain type of relief, neither does a court, under that general provision that --              That's right, but -- but with these new provisions, if the hearing officer doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.             Well, you agree they go, as we say, in pari passu --             -- that -- that whatever the hearing officer can do, the court can do.             -- and whatever he can't do, the court can't do.               (i)(2)(B)(iii) --               (i)(2)(B)(iii)?               It's now (C)?               (C)(iii).              Let me be clear.   Am I correct that under -- under the theory of the statute that you are supporting, it would be possible for a parent, without first consulting with the school at all, to put the child in a private school and then later to request public school services, and when it is -- when they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?
08-310 +++$+++              Not fishing ships, right?             None of -- none of Valdez's fishermen have to pay this tax at all?                 And nonmobile homes are not taxed as real property?               So was all other personal property exempt from taxation, they didn't have a personal property tax, right?               That's nicely targeted as well.   But there is no constitutional impediment to targeting the people of New Jersey through taxing the oil equipment.             But you can't -- you can't make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal governance.    You can make them bear the burden of the services provided to them in harbor.                     But you cannot make them the instrument of funding all other municipal services.    That's what the Tonnage Clause means.             You are counting the state tax as well, right?              You are counting the state tax on oil equipment?              Wait a minute, owed to the State for what?     What would be owed to the state?                  It's still a State tax and they are the collection agent, and it's a -- a credit against what they owe for their collections, right?              What -- what's it a credit against?     I don't understand what it's a credit against.              What does the city get a credit against?              -- as referred to in the --              Oh, I thought it was the city that got the credit --              Which is -- for a commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much it's worth.              The more cargo you can carry, the more valuable the commercial ship.             It offended them aesthetically? (Laughter.)                 So all the State has to say is we are not -- we're not taxing you qua vessel. (Laughter.)                 I mean, what --                 Mr. Olson --                 -- let me ask you something about -- about discrimination.                Let's assume that I think it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory tax, property tax just levied on -- on ships or not. If that is my position, why should I count as establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska or Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property tax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right?                 And the burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of this vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey.              I mean, you know, that --              It's getting somebody else to bear the burden of your taxation.              Taxing that equipment raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other states.   Why should I count that property tax as proving that either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being discriminatory?   Just because it -- it can't possibly violate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it isn't as much discriminatory against other states.              No, I --             And if -- if California taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in and say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax that our own citizens are subjected to.             I wouldn't let them point to the Silicon Valley tax.                 If that's all it applied to, then the wharfage tax would have been perfectly okay.   You can't say that was --
08-322 +++$+++             No, the parallel -- the parallel isn't there.       I mean, there are laws against intentional discrimination.            So there should be laws against wiretapping.      There should also be laws against intentional discrimination.            But where the -- the argument here is not that those laws be eliminated. It's just that the preclearance requirements be eliminated.            A long time ago.         How much of the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically circumvention evidence?            Not comparative, however. Not comparative with the rest of the country except in -- in --              Oh, let's talk about the bailout provision.      That -- that was inserted in 1982.              How many years is that? Over a quarter of a century, there have been 15 bailouts that have gone through?        All of them in the State of Virginia?              You bring this before us as a justification for the legislation.              It's obviously quite impracticable --              -- for anybody to bail out.              The question is whether it's right, not whether Congress rejected it. (Laughter.)             It fends off Section 2 suits, I assume.     I mean, that's great.               You get a declaratory judgment, here -- you know, a benediction, and you skip off without having to face suits.                  That may be one reason.     Another reason may be that they like the packing of minorities and the other -- the other districting tricks that can be -- that can be pulled because - because of the requirements of the Voting Rights Act.             Well, they get elected under this system.     Why should that they take it away?             I say, everybody who voted for this -- this system was elected under this system. Should it be surprising that they think it it's a good thing?            We are not insisting that they -- the other side is not insisting that they be kicked out.    If they want to voluntarily stay in, fine. In fact, you should let other States and other jurisdiction opt in if they want to.            If you want to make this a voluntary system that's something entirely different, but the question is assuming a State or -- or a covered jurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the right to coerce them to be in?            That's all we are talking about.            If they want to stay in, that's fine.             That was 1980?             The bailout provision was adopted in 1982, 27 years ago.             There have been 15 bailouts since then.     Is that what you think Congress contemplated when it enacted the bailout provision in 1982?             Less than one a year?            What I understand it, is this incorrect?    As I understand it for Travis County to get a bailout, it would -- it has within Travis County something like 106 political subdivisions that are covered, and Travis County would have to go to all of those 106 and demonstrate that there has been no violation by any of those 106 for the preceding whatever it is, five years, whatever the bailout provision is. You think that's -- you think that's feasible?            Travis County is not the superior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this district here.    This district is a subdivision of the State, but not of Travis County.              Mr. Adegbile, what was -- I read it in the briefs, and I forget what it was.                     What was the vote on this 2006 extension -- 98 to nothing in the Senate, and what was it in the House?                   Was --              33 to 390.          You know, the -- the Israeli Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin, used to have a rule that if the death penalty was pronounced unanimously, it was invalid, because there must be something wrong there.       Do you ever expect -- do you ever seriously expect Congress to vote against a reextension of the Voting Rights Act?                   Do you really think that any incumbent would -- would vote to do that?              Twenty-five years from now? Fifty years from now?      When?              Thirty-three members of the House and nobody in the Senate.            Wasn't Virginia the first State in the Union to elect a black governor.            And it has a black chief justice of the supreme court currently.
08-351 +++$+++           And you say it was likely to -- these same named plaintiffs were likely  - likely -- to face this same situation again?          Well, if you are relying on -- on, you know, "capable of repetition, yet evading review," that's -- that's the test, whether -- whether indeed these people stand a chance of having the same thing happen.          You are begging the question.     That is, you are assuming that the class is a valid class.     It hasn't been certified.         How -- how can you make that -- that argument when there is no class?          Just an asserted class on your part.     There s no class.          As it turns out it -- it wouldn't have been gratuitous. (Laughter.)          I thought you said -- I thought you said the innocent owner defense didn't have to be inquired into in the probable cause here.           I thought that was your position.          Okay, you want  -          Okay.        That makes it harder.   You re challenging this -- this statute on its face, isn't that right?          No?          Just as applied?          No, how can you have an --          How can you have an as-applied challenge to an entire class?          Why -- why -- to -- to have an as-applied challenge, regardless of whether the Illinois law provides a -- a remedy, wouldn't you be able to individually assert under section 1983 unconstitutional action? I mean, isn't there a Federal remedy?           If all you're concerned about is as-applied, you mean you are being treated unconstitutionally by a State and you have no remedy?          Why isn't that enough?          But they will know about the probable cause hearing that you want to -- that you want set up, right?            Which -- which is why you are asking for a facial challenge.                 You want these hearings in all cases --            -- regardless of what the individual circumstances are; isn't that so?            It is not so?            Well, what are the individual circumstances of all the other people in the class?   We don't know what they are.                We don't know whether it's a car that has been taken, money that has been taken, whether they are millionaires, whether they need the car.   We know nothing about them.          You think -- you think it's unconstitutional as applied to everybody who is not given this -- this preliminary hearing.           That's -- that's what the complaint says. Your -- the class you want certified is the class of everybody who has not been given a preliminary hearing.   I don't know the difference between that and saying that this statute is unconstitutional as applied.          I mean, just  - just because you don't say in your complaint, this is a facial challenge, it amounts to a facial challenge.           You say, everybody who has not been given a preliminary hearing is entitled to relief because the statute is bad as to all of them.          That is not the class you asked to be certified.       You asked to certify everybody who had been denied a preliminary hearing.            It doesn't change this -- this action from a class action -- from a facial challenge into a nonfacial challenge.             They can't change your complaint. You were either asking this to be struck down on its face, or you weren't.             And what -- what the Seventh Circuit did doesn't change that.          Some of them are worth --          -- a lot of money.        Yes.             My potential class,  you should call it.
08-441 +++$+++ 
08-453 +++$+++                  Well, wait a minute.        I -- this is state law.      And if the State supreme court has said that the statute means a certain thing and that certain thing is a little bit different from what the Federal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the Federal Government in applying State law has to -- has to take that difference into account, doesn't it?                 The Federal Government doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.             I don't see any difference whatever in that regard between using the active and passive.              Well, that's not State law applying of its own force, just as your second example was not State law applying of its own force.                       It was State law that had been converted into Federal law by the Federal Government's adoption of it.              That's a different situation.             You are arguing for conflict pre-emption.       I mean that's a -- that's a different issue than, say, that the -- the State law shouldn't apply.   But don't tell me the State law applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce State law?             It -- it has so much spare time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going to be worrying about State law?              That's conflict pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law.                      You shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that provides a separate standard that conflicts with the Federal standard.    So you pre-empt the law.                    You don't say the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce it.   That's a weird way to solve that problem.                 Sure, there is.             Would -- would you acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing State laws apart from visitation?               And what Waters involved was enforcing State laws through visitation. Of course, you can do that through -- through visitation powers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing a lawsuit or whatever.             I didn't mean to.
08-472 +++$+++             Well, of course, it was that, but the question is whether it was a permissible amendment by the government of the situation.               Of course, I will stipulate that the government was trying to arrange it so that the cross could remain there.                   But that doesn't mean that it was -- it was evading the injunction.    I mean, that's --            Unless the injunction clearly applied to the erection of a cross on private land that the government had -- had transferred.             I will -- I will concede that the obvious purpose of that was to avoid being in violation of the injunction.             But that doesn't mean that it's invalid.             The cross doesn't honor non-Christians who fought in the war?                  Is that -- is that --             Where does it say that?             It's erected as a war memorial.   I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead.   It's the -- the cross is the -- is the most common symbol of -- of -- of the resting place of the dead, and it doesn't seem to me -- what would you have them erect?    A cross -- some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and star?            I don't think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead.                    I think that's an outrageous conclusion.            Has the government ever turned down -- let's say the Jewish war veterans request to put up a war memorial on --            I am talking about -- on this site?            You know, well, I'm not talking about this site, where there already was a memorial, but suppose the -- what I'm getting at is I don't agree with you, that -- that every time the government allows any religious symbol to be erected, it has to allow all religious symbols to be erected at the same place, so long as it is -- it is not discriminatory in -- in accepting or rejecting requests to erect religious symbols in different places. I don't see why the government is convicted of being discriminatory.            But -- but you don't -- and they -- were both of them proposed by a private group, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars?            Well, but it was erected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars.            I mean, do you know of any instance in which Jewish war veterans or if there is an organization of Muslim war veterans, requested to erect a memorial on public land, it was turned down?            I just don't see why they all have to be on the same piece of land, in -- in order for the government to be impartial.               Well, I think you are saying that, and you are saying that this has to be a public forum.   In fact, I'm not even sure your -- your brief would limit it to religious symbols.              You say it has to be an open forum.         Right?
08-479 +++$+++                You're saying the whole search, not just the search of the undergarments. You're saying they couldn't even have searched her backpack, right?               Why?               So you want a sliding scale?              As -- as I understand your - your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any search that requires the outer garments to be taken off. So it didn't really matter whether they required her to shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her underwear?              But is a strip search and -- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the student to even take off the outer garments?              The police would require --              The police would require probable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?             Is probable cause a jury question too?             Yes, probable cause in the ordinary criminal investigation cases.                  Is that a jury question?              I don't think it's a question.     You can -- even -- even in a 1983 action, I don't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether there was probable cause for an officer's search or seizure.     That's new to me.
08-495 +++$+++                 Well, except -- except for his modified hangout.         His modified -- his modified categorical does -- does expand; doesn't it?              And also interrogatories to the jury.             You -- you wouldn't allow that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would you?              I'm not -- I -- I'm losing you.   I would -- I would have thought that you have to have convicted him of the larger scheme.              Oh, I didn't --                 Well, I would -- I thought that was the whole case we had before us, Where you haven't proved either as an element or -- or by a separate jury finding how much money was involved.                 Your point is you don't have to.                 You can establish that later.              I -- I would have thought you would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a crime of violence is an aggravated felony.              It isn't.              It depends on how you read the language.     I guess -- I guess grammatically it could be read either way.       You can read it:                an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which -- in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000.                Or you could read it: convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit, in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000. I mean, "convicted" doesn't necessarily apply to the last -- to the last phrase.              -- and that's basically what we're arguing about.
08-5274 +++$+++                 Does it require that the discharge be during and in relation to the crime?                    I mean, suppose the bank robber, you know, he sees -- son of a gun, he sees among the customers a man that ran off with his wife a year ago, and he is just overcome with anger, and he -- you know, he takes a shot at this guy. It's not in relation to the bank robbery.                 Would -- would that discharge be covered?              Yes.              Do you think that -- regardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do you think he has to discharge it or that he has to brandish it?   It is the passive voice.                 Does it mean if anybody discharges it or brandishes it?              Grabs it out of his hand and brandishes it.             We don't really have to decide all this stuff, do we?              We just have to decide whether if he discharges it the discharge has to be intentional.              It has to be during the crime.             And you say it can't come from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue, it wouldn't apply to the mere possession.             And the possession could be at any time, before the crime, after the crime, whatever.              So you have to import some -- some contemporaneous -- contemporaneous requirement into the 1, 2, and 3.              What if it's committed when the guy is trying to escape, and the gun goes off accidentally?   Is that in -- I mean is that during the crime?              Two hours later when he got home -- he carried the gun in -- IN furtherance of the crime.   He still had it with him all the way through, and the gun went off after he left the bank.              It's not your argument because if that was the only -- if that was the source of the contemporaneous requirement, there would be no contemporaneous requirement for the in furtherance?              The provision -- the in furtherance provision.              And, of course, some of these difficult hypotheticals such as the one that Justice Stevens put about the gun going off while the -- while the individual is escaping, that's going to be a problem whether you adopt your interpretation or the -- or the petitioner's interpretation, even if you assume that it has to be during and in relation to it's still going to be a problem.      Is this -- is this during and in relation to the crime.              If it occurs, you know, five hours later while he's escaping, I don't know.             You don't have to decide that.
08-538 +++$+++             Well, it's not a realistic valuation.   Nobody thinks that that's an honest valuation of the equipment.           It's simply adding up the -- the exemption she was entitled to.            It s just -- her valuation just happened to be exactly the amount that the two exemptions she had would add up to.          Well, but she was maxed out.   Once she used it for that, she was maxed out, but she wanted to have her cake and eat it too.            She wanted to get the exemption for the food and she wanted to get the exemption for the -- for the equipment.            And so it just so happened that the equipment valuation added up to precisely what was left over after she took the exemption for the -- for the food.
08-586 +++$+++               That's a wonderfully clear command, isn't it?    Such consideration as is appropriate?    What is the language?                   Read it.   What is it?            Wow. (Laughter.)            No, it's meaningless.           It tells the court to make its own judgment.                   Such consideration as the court deems due.                   Give it whatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like. It's utterly meaningless to me.             Is that the test that the court of appeals here applied?             Is that the test that the court of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want us to affirm?             So we should remand it for application of the test that you propose?             Surely that's a disputed fact, isn't it?    And you want us to dispose -- or you want this to be disposed of on summary judgment.                      The other side says the services aren't that much different.            It wasn't talking about this particular case.       It was talking about in general, wasn't --             That are what?            Would -- would you give us the citations of the parts of the record that you say render it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower court to consider a comparison with non- -- with institutional charges?            At 16a of the Joint Appendix you are talking about?            Of the petition.
08-598 +++$+++  
08-6 +++$+++               Which apparently he had told her about.              If you accept that -- of course it does; and this is not a new procedure.                 I -- I didn't understand it to be a new procedure, as Justice Breyer has described it.               It is the procedure of habeas corpus. They have a procedure for habeas corpus which includes discovery, and all he has to do is come in and say, you know, I have been wrongfully convicted; I am innocent; and I want to discover this evidence in order to establish it, so that I can get out of jail.              It is very strange.   Why did they do that, I wonder.                 There was a lot of other evidence in the case, wasn't there?                 I don't know what they thought they were doing.                And you will see cases where the defendant maintained that the defendant was innocent.   Now, whether this was a requirement imposed by Alaska or not, it seems to me you cannot point to the practice of the other States and say Alaska must have the same practice. When, in fact, you don't comply with the practices of the other States.                Almost all of them do require an assertion of innocence, which your client has not made.   I cannot imagine how you can simply -- oh, look at all these other -- 44 other states, when your client does not meet the requirements that those States would impose.              His counsel -- his counsel forwent the DNA testing, and we attribute the actions of counsel to the defendant.              But they will have acquired the advantage of having a chance of the jury's acquitting them at the trial.             Because by not asking for the DNA testing, they was a chance the jury might let them off.   Had they asked for it then and had it shown conclusively, the game was over.               So it is gaming the system.             Ex-ante.         We're -- we're looking at it at the time of the trial.                    Does its pay for the defendant to ask for a DNA test?                    Well, of course, it doesn't.      Because if he asks for it and it -- it finds that he's guilty, that's the end of it.                       There is no chance of the jury acquitting him.             So why not just not ask for it and if it turns out that the jury happens to convict him anyway, then ask for it?               That's a biggie, though.               I am quite dubious that -- that he would indeed sign it.              I -- I was really struck by his affidavit in this case, number -- or paragraph 9 of which says:   "I have no doubt whatsoever that retesting of the condom will prove once and for all time" -- and one expects to follow -- my innocence. That's not what it says.           "Will prove once and for all time either my guilt or innocence."              I mean, you know, what is this?
08-604 +++$+++              But it didn't -- it didn't promise them that categorically.               There were certain things they had to do, right?            One of which was to have conferencing, and in three of these cases they didn't. So that promise didn't extend at least to those three cases.   And in the other two, where there was conferencing, the act also provides, as any sensible act would have to, for the adoption of procedural rules. And the procedural rule here, according to the arbitrator, required the submission of that evidence of -- of consultation with the complaint, which didn't happen.             Do -- do you say that all five were -- were conferenced?               Is that your position?              It's in the statute, isn't it?             Do they do anything else? What do they do?    What does the adjustment board do?             I don't want to get you in trouble, but I'm not sure they do anything.                I don't know how that could possibly be true.     I can't imagine being an arbitrator and not being able to say:            All right, you know, we are going to have a conference next Tuesday.                 I want you to have all of the -- all of the papers relevant to this particular point that we are going to discuss in by two days before. Can't do that?                I would not know how to run an arbitration without -- without establishing some rules of procedure.                Well --             Well, at least back off from your statement that an arbitrator cannot set rules of procedure.             Oh, all right.         That's a little different.             Well, you're making sense. It says that, or it just doesn't address the question of whether they have to be included in the original submission?    I mean, I assume there is no provision that says -- or I missed it, there is no provision that says the conferencing materials do not have to be included in the original submission?               I thought you said he did have rulemaking power, so long as it did not contradict --               Let's not get -- can I ask about argumentative facts?           I frankly have never heard of a phrase like argumentative facts.                   You seem to think it means only those facts that are in dispute.               Well, that would be a pretty incomprehensible statement of the -- of the event, if you write in your brief statement of facts and you only write down the facts that are disputed and none of the facts that are agreed to. It couldn't possibly mean that.                   I would think that argumentative facts simply means facts relevant to the argument, and one of the facts relevant to the argument is whether you did the necessary consultation.     But I don't know how you could interpret argumentative facts to mean only those facts that are in dispute.   What kind of a statement of facts would that be?               Well --
08-6261 +++$+++                What do you mean?         Not on their own -- not on their own behalf.                     I mean, that - that's a quite different issue.                 That's the issue that was decided below, whether -               -- whether a private interested party can be authorized to bring the suit on behalf of the sovereign.               I understand, but you - you covered two things.          You said whether a private individual can bring it on his own.               Or whether a private individual can be appointed to bring it on behalf of the sovereign.              And I thought it was only -- only the second of these that you say is out of the case.   You say the first is out of the case, too?              No.             I don't know what you mean by "in the interest of"?           On behalf of?           Is that what you mean?     Are you saying -- you acknowledge here that it is on behalf of the United States but you say it doesn't have to be in the interest of the United States, is that it?             I don't know what that means.    Are you asserting that this suit has been brought on behalf of the United States by your client?               Gee, I have really lost you.   What is going off in a different direction? Really? (Laughter.)             Well, okay.      You're - you're asserting that this agreement with the United States Attorney cannot cover this case because your client was not acting on behalf of the United States, but rather in her private capacity.             And that's perfectly okay, right?              Some problems have no answers.    I mean, that doesn't prove anything.              Do you think that Congress could -- could set up a private organization to expend Federal funds -- we are going to abolish the Department of Education.     And we are going to give its function to a private organization that will take care of all those things.     No good, right?              On -- on behalf of -             -- on behalf of the executive. You are looking for a section of the Constitution; I suggest Article II, Section 1, the executive power shall be vested in the President.             And just as the executive power includes the power to expend funds appropriated by Congress, so also the executive power except in the - in the instance of necessity acknowledged by Young, which I think was wrongly decided anyway -- except in that one narrow instance, the -- the power to prosecute belongs to the executive.             Oh, I don't think that's right.    Private prosecutions were common at the time of the framing?     You have got to go back a long way before they were common.             You want to plea bargain with a -- with an interested party?             Is that the situation here in D.C.?   When the woman comes in, can the judge look it over and say, Ah, you don't have anything here; I'm not going to -- I'm not going to allow you to go ahead.             How do you understand - how does the statute read?            As I understand it, it's not up to the judge to decide whether there is enough there to allow her to go forward or to appoint somebody on his own.   She is the prosecutor.            It's up to her whether there is -                A hearing on whether she can prosecute or a hearing on -- on whether he's going to be guilty or not.             Or pay $1,000 to your victim, which is me.             Courts don't have the power to incarcerate people.       I mean, if you are prosecuting for a criminal offense, you are exercising more than the power of the Court.             But nobody asserted in Young that the prosecutor appointed by the court was only exercising the power of the court.                 Surely it was the power of the government that the -- that the prosecutor was exercising.           Now, the court was given the power to appoint that prosecutor, but I would think it's extraordinary to say that there's nothing but the court's power in play.               Then why doesn't an agreement by the United States not to prosecute carry the day?             And I have to agree with you that to accept this argument that the prosecutor here is an agent just of the court, just of the D.C. court, not an agent of the executive?             Well, I'm not making the argument.             I don't know that courts have ever asserted that they themselves have the power to prosecute.             Not on behalf of the court. On behalf of the government, and that's why Young said you should offer it first to the United States Attorney, and only if he won't bring it, then you can appoint somebody else to bring it.           But the -- the prosecutor is not the court.   My God.       What a terrible situation.              The prosecutor's the court, the judge is the court?              Isn't it the case that only the U.S. Attorney can prosecute for this crime?                    Could the D.C. attorney general or whatever the name of it, what, counsel, prosecute for this felony?              Because it's all up to the court; the court's the big prosecutor, right?
08-645 +++$+++            Most courts in countries signatory of the treaty have come out the other way and agree that a ne exeat right is a right of custody, and those courts include the U.K., France, Germany -- I believe, Canada.    Very few come out the way you -- how many come out your way?           You're writing our opinion for us, are you? (Laughter.)           Yes, but, still, in all, I mean, they include some biggies, like the House of Lords, right?   And -- and the purpose of a treaty is to have everybody doing the same thing, and -- and I think, we -- if it's a case of some ambiguity, we should try to go along with what seems to be the consensus in -- in other countries that are signatories to the treaty.           Germany.           Is Australia -- is Australia unclear?           Well, according to the Petitioner's brief, if this is inaccurate, the Australian court followed the English Court of Appeal s decision that Justice Ginsburg referred to, emphasizing the desirability of uniform interpretations of the convention, and I count that against you, the Australia.           We will have to parse them out, obviously.           Well, if these things were effective --           -- we wouldn't -- we wouldn't have a treaty, would we?           If these local remedies were effective, we wouldn't have a treaty.           Wait, does that provision of Texas law override the -- the treaty that the United States has entered into?           Texas can ignore the treaty, because the child is over 12 years old?
08-651 +++$+++             What -- what about misadvice as to whether he will lose custody of his children, or misadvice as to whether his -- his truck which he owns will be confiscated by the government?          What are the consequences to the lawyer?    I mean, let's assume you are a public defender, and you are confronted with this situation. Is it -- how -- how much skin is it off your teeth if you provide the advice, even though you are uncertain, and the advice turns out to be wrong?             What happens to the lawyer?          So, what incentive is there to withhold uncertain advice?            Is there any incentive at all?           I mean, the worst that can happen is your client will get off.           He ll make a guilty plea, and afterwards it will be set aside.          After -- after a mini-trial, which deprives the government of -- of its whole benefit from the guilty plea.                Governments accept guilty pleas in order to avoid the time and expense of going to -- to a trial.        And here you have to go back and find out what the evidence would have been, so that the court can make the decision you say is so easy.          Well, but assuming it's a norm and that all lawyers do it, including those that know diddly about immigration law, the norm is to give bad advice.    And -- and here the norm was met, right? (Laughter.)          I thought the point is that -- I thought your point was that  - that Strickland does require professional norms to be observed, but it is professional norms regarding advising a defendant as to the trial consequences of his plea, as to those matters that are involved in the prosecution, and not as to collateral matters.     Isn't that your point?          Those are the only norms that are relevant, what norms oblige counsel to advise a defendant regarding trial matters.
08-660 +++$+++               Except that the government here has considerable powers even without intervening, and they include its ability to move to stay discovery, which normally a party would only be able to do.                  It can object to any voluntary dismissal or settlement, which normally would be a party's right.              And some courts have allowed the government to move to dismiss.              So unlike -- unlike your adversary here, you -- your adversary says the government is a party for all purposes; you are not saying the government is not a party for all purposes. You're saying it's not a party for some purposes?              You are saying that.              But you're also saying as for the rest, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.              You rely a lot, counsel, on -- on intervention, as that's what makes the government a party.              Right?              The original statute or the earlier statute did not use the word "intervention."              I forget the different word it used?              Appearance?              Well, I really wonder whether they didn't intend the same -- the same result. If you think they consciously -- under the prior statute, you would say the government --              The government would have been a party?              Because you can be a party and not appear.               The other side acknowledges that.   They say, however, it's different when you have real party in interest plus the party named --               -- and these things are styled "United States."               No, no, no.      No, no, that's -- that's unfair.    If you are a real party in interest and you are the named party --               You're normally a party.             Except the United States has a lot of power.      Unlike the -- the government's presentation here, you would not allow any degree of activity on the part of the government to cause it to be a party, even if it exercises all these other powers short of intervening?       It must intervene in your --             Well, do you want a bright line or not a bright line?             Do you agree with the government?             Do you agree with the government's presentation that it becomes a party when it reaches a certain ineffable degree of activity in the case? (Laughter.)                 I don't think they were relying on Devlin.      The --                 The point they are making here --                 --- is not that we're a party for some purposes and not for others.               The point they're making is we're a party for all purposes, once we reach a certain degree of activity in the case.                 I think they were.                 We disagree on that.             We'll hear from them.             I have a question for you, Mr. Wall. (Laughter.)             What is the government's position on that point?              Doesn't it need the 60 days to figure out whether it would want to intervene in order to be able to appeal?              But they are not statutes which give the government an extended period of time in order to allow the consultation.                This is a statute that does that.   And why would they -- why would they not envision the need for that consultation in the situation where the government has had no participation but comes up with a -- with a decision contrary to what it thinks the good law is, and it has to decide whether it wants to intervene in order to appeal.                Why shouldn't they be given 60 days?                 But it is -- it is a potential appellant.        I mean if you say Congress is concerned about situations in which the government is a potential appellant.        It is a potential appellant in these cases until the 30 days have elapsed, at least. It -- it can intervene, and why shouldn't it have the 60 days to decide whether to appeal or not?                 I understand, but this -- this goes to your argument about congressional intent: That they were concerned about preserving to the government time as a potential appellant to think the matter over.    It seems to me that argument is -- is a wash.             Can the United States intervene within those 30 days --             -- and then appeal?             I think it's a potential appellant.
08-661 +++$+++            Well, the stated purpose is to promote the game.       The purpose is to make money.       I don't think that they care whether the sale of the helmet or the T-shirt promotes the game.            They -- they sell it to make money from the sale.           Now, it promotes the game if the money from the sale goes to the whole group, I suppose.   But -- but don't tell me that there is not -- absent this agreement, there would not be an independent, individual incentive for each of the teams to sell as many of its own -- of its own shirts and helmets as possible.           Well, I suppose that -- that could -- that issue could be tried.           But I don't -- I don't think so.     And I suppose that's a triable issue, as to whether the purpose of -- of selling these things is to promote the whole NFL or to promote the particular team.           Well, you -- you say that the -- that the trademarks have no value apart from the -- from the game.        I guess you could say the same thing for each individual franchise of each of the 32 clubs.   They are worthless, if NFL football disappears.   So does that mean they -- they can agree to fix the price at which their -- their franchises will be sold, by concerted agreement, because after all, they re worthless apart from the NFL?           Yes.           Oh, okay, you --           I thought I was reducing it to the absurd.     But you -- (Laughter.)
08-67 +++$+++ 
08-674 +++$+++            They're not bound to it. They -- they are saying that -- claiming -- that their rates are too high because the contract was too high, so -- and therefore, their rates are unreasonable.          And what Mobile-Sierra says -- it certainly says it as between the two contracting parties -- that if it's at arm-length between sophisticated seller and buyer of -- of the power, they are bound by it, and the -- and the issue is here is whether somebody downstream who says that since this contract is so exorbitant, the rates are too high, whether that person is likewise bound by Mobile-Sierra.                Isn't that right?           But that -- that's because of section 4.C, you say?           Right.       Which -- which gives the Commission a good deal of flexibility, which you say you -- your clients don't have or your State doesn't have.     But that isn't the basis on which this case was decided below.         It was decided on the very simple basis that the Mobile-Sierra doctrine simply does not apply to challenges by third parties.                 It had nothing to do with the details of 4.C and the -- the excessive discretion given -- given to the Commission but not to you. It was a very simple proposition on which we granted cert, whether Mobile-Sierra's public interest standard applies when a contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a party to the contract.             That's the question.   And what's your answer to that?           Do you support the opinion of the -- of the court below?           It isn't about contracts. It's about reasonable rates.            I thought what it was, was a determination by the Commission, approved by -- by this Court, that when two giants of the industry, very knowledgeable, deal at arm's-length and come up with -- with a contract, that is presumptively reasonable, and unless it contravenes the public interest, that rate will -- will be upheld. Now, you say it should be upheld only between the two contracting parties.             What good does that do?            It s -- it's a lot easier that way, and we're more likely to reach a correct result, rather than -- than wading in with, you know, -- from scratch.    That's our usual practice.          Has anybody before --          -- even suggested that Mobile-Sierra is a  sometimes  thing?           Do -- did any of our opinions say that it's a  sometimes  thing, except in one respect, and that is the doctrine does not apply when -- when, downstream, the rates -- or even between the parties, the rates would violate the public interest? That's a  sometimes.           It won't apply then, but have we ever suggested that, you know, today it may; tomorrow it -- it won't?          Or have we ever suggested what standards might determine the  sometimes  question?          Have we ever suggested how you can -- you can have a  sometimes  doctrine which will produce the stability in the industry that Mobile- Sierra was intended to produce? I mean, that was the whole purpose of Mobile-Sierra.    People had to be able to predict whether they can take natural gas out of the ground, how much they can make on it, and once they enter into an arm's-length contract, they should be able to rely on it. That was the whole purpose.             And, now, you want to us say, well, sometimes it will work, and sometimes it won't.     And we're not going to say when; we're going to leave it to the D.C. Circuit to invent some  sometimes. That doesn't make any sense, does it?              But FERC can t -- can FERC -- can FERC challenge, too?              Because FERC's a -- sort of a third party.             Okay.    So -- so Mobile-Sierra doesn't apply to FERC, even?             Who does it apply to?   I mean, it's just -- just the two parties?             Okay.             Can a noncontracting party go to FERC and challenge it before FERC, whereupon FERC is no longer bound by Mobile-Sierra?             Or is FERC suddenly unchained when a third party brings a proceeding before FERC?     It's a strange situation.             No, no.   The public interest standard is a just and reasonable standard. What -- what it amounts to is saying, when -- when you have a contract rate that's been negotiated between sophisticated parties, that rate is presumptively just and reasonable, and the only way you can show that it is not just and reasonable is to show that the public interest is harmed. It's -- it's not something different from the just and reasonable standard, or it would be contrary to -- to the statute because the statute requires that the rates be just and reasonable, right?

They didn't know he had made up his mind.             Do -- do we have to ask him, you know, what visitors?            I mean, is that the question?             Do you want to have any visitors today?            Or -- or do you ask him, are you willing to speak to investigators about a crime? And he says what crime?       I mean, how specific does -- does the request for permission to have visitors have to be?            -- for this rule to cut in?             Excuse me, what is the ethical rule about counsel?             I thought if -- if there's counsel in a particular case and you want to approach the client about that case, you can't do it without going to counsel.             But when there is an entirely different case, there is totally different litigation, you can't approach the fellow without going back to the counsel whom he hired for a different case? I don't think that's the ethical rule.                   But that's the effect of Edwards.     Even if it's a different crime, you have to go back to the counsel whom he hired for a different prosecution?         That bears no relationship to the ethical rules of -- of counsel.             What if -- what if we limited Edwards to the same crime?               That would -- that would really make it much easier form the police to --             -- to know whether this person in fact invoked the right to counsel.               So that would --               Well, you are being very unrealistic.   Have you ever known defense counsel who says, "Oh, yes," to submit to the interrogation?                  I mean -- you know, once they are lawyered up, they are not going to talk.     You know that.             Doesn't -- but doesn't the beginning of the Miranda warning tell him that he doesn't have to --             Do I misunderstand Miranda warnings?   Isn't he told, at the very outset of the Miranda warning, that he doesn't have to talk, if he doesn't want to talk? Is that -- is that any less strong than -- than asking him whether he wants to receive visitors, in general?    Or, in particular, a visitor who wants to ask him about a particular crime? I mean, he is -- he is told that with the Miranda warning, which he is given the second time.              If you don't want to talk, you don't have to.              If you want a lawyer to be present, you are entitled to a lawyer, or -- and -- and or, else, we terminate. I don't know why that isn't enough.             He doesn't care whether he gets an attorney, so long as he doesn't have to talk to investigators.   That's the issue, whether he must talk to these investigators, and he is told, right up-front, You don't have to do it, and if -- if you want an attorney for it, we will get you an attorney. Otherwise, we -- we will terminate the interview.              He doesn't ask for an attorney.   He just says, I don't want to talk without an attorney.   That's what he says.              He doesn't demand an attorney.   He says, I don't want to talk without an attorney.   And the investigators say, Okay, in that case, we won't talk to you.

08-6925 +++$+++              You -- you -- you would have us believe that by "violent felony" in this -- in this statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat? It doesn't even have to be the act.                    You know, if you don't shut up, I am going to come over and thwonk you on your shoulder with my index finger.                    I'm going to (snap).   This is a violent felony under this statute which gets him how many more years?             Fifteen years for (snap). (Laughter.)             But that's all he's necessarily been convicted of.               When a verdict is brought in in Florida under this misdemeanor statute, all you know for sure is that he threatened to go (snap).   That's all you know for sure that he has been convicted of, and you are going to give him 15 years.             No, but you don't prosecute them for pick pocketing.        You have a clumsy pick pocket and you prosecute him for battery, right?              And he gets 15 years.             You know, I guess it comes down to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was using technical language or Congress was using simply ordinary language, because you are quite right that the definition of -- of battery covers even the slightest touching.   The use of physical force, which would include the slightest touching. But in using that definition to define the term "violent felony," I find it hard to believe that Congress was using the term in a technical sense, and was not using the term "physical force," "the use of physical force" to mean something more than a mere touching. But that's -- that's basically what we are arguing, isn't it?    Whether that -- whether that phrase there, "threatened use of physical" -- "use or threatened use of physical force," is technical language which is the definition of battery, or rather more common usage. You -- you would acknowledge that, that in more common usage, no one -- no one would think that if you go over to somebody and point your finger at him on his lapel and say, "Now, you listen to me," that that would be considered the use or threatened use of physical force?            Where is the provision? 922(g)(9), is that in your brief somewhere?            I am looking for it.     I don't see it.   922(g)(9).            I hate people talking about statutes that I don't have in front of me.            3(a).            I thought you said 922. That's what I thought you said.            Explosives.            But (2) -- (2) looks to the conduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime. So you could actually look to the conduct of which the person was convicted, no?            No, no, no.      You look to the crime -- under (1), you look to the crime he was convicted of, and if -- if -- if none of its elements require serious physical force, you can say it doesn't qualify under (1), but under (2) if in fact you see the misdemeanor he was convicted of was really whacking somebody really hard, then -- then it could possibly come within -- come under (2).              Just at the elements.              Can I ask you about -- about 922?   You point to the -- the definition there, the definition in 921.         But that is a definition of the term, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.            And in the context of defining that term, I'm perfectly willing to believe that the use or attempted use of physical force means even the slightest touching, as -- as battery does.     You are talking about a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. But what we have before us here is a term -- a different term that is being defined and that term is violent felony.     And I find it a lot harder to swallow that -- that that definition embraces merely the slightest touching.             I dare say that Congress in my view probably didn't even contemplate that something which is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if you did it the second time.             Have we ever approved that, by the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply because of recidivism?              States do it all the time when they have different degrees of battery. Misdemeanor -- felony battery -- they do it all the time.
08-724 +++$+++             These experts said he had improved?            Before this testimony on the stand?            Wow.            That didn't look like improvement to me. (Laughter.)               Well, I think -- I think it was swallowing the worst evidence.                  It was telling the jury that was going to think this is a hateful person who had done hateful things. I agree with you.           I accept all of that, but even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant closing argument.     You said you've -- you've conducted many capital cases. Have you ever conducted a capital case in which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he will do it again? How many cases have you had like that?            This was an extraordinary trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this fellow was -- was the best that could have been done.              So I think that we have to defer to all of those, right?              I think, if they could have been relying on any of those, we would have to defer to all, wouldn't we?              One-by-one, I mean -              Why would we assume that?              When we -- when you don't know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume the best, not the worst.          Isn't that the standard rule of review?              You, very often, don't know on what basis the lower court took action.               You assume it was a lawful basis.              Which insulates it from being overturned.             But that is not what AEDPA says.    AEDPA says that we have to give deference unless it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. The burden is on the appealing defendant to show that it was an unreasonable application.                In case of doubt, he loses. Now, AEDPA could have been written differently.    It could have been written the way you want.    The Supreme Court shall evaluate the reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion.                It isn't written that way.     It says the burden is on you to show that this was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.     And where there is a summary disposition, that's a hard road aho.             It's -- it's not impossible.     I think there are cases where -- where relying on prior Supreme Court law doesn't get you there.    It's not impossible.             So we should revise the statute and it should not say unreasonable application of Supreme Court law?             Why doesn't it?              That's not how the - that's not how the statute reads.             That's not what it says. That's not what it says.         It says that you have to show that it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.    That's what it says.             And if they can't, you lose.    Because that's the way the statute reads.             You want to say if they can't, we have a new statute.             But we don't.     The burden on you is to show that it's an unreasonable application. If you tell me we can't tell, you lose.            Counsel, I don't understand that, I don't understand that.              Do you want to go around that again?            Does Teague say anything about time?              Where -- where is that in the instructions?     I -- I didn't realize that that's what you are counting on.           Where is it?              It's in your brief, I assume.             Read it again?             New?       New?             Is that in your brief, too? I just don't remember it from your brief.
08-728 +++$+++                 Except for the -- for the language, which -- which says that you -- you time it from the beginning of the time granted.            Well, what's the effect of that language then?      Why didn't (D) just read "delay resulting from any pretrial motion"?            And counsel wouldn't know until -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or not until -- until a later finding is either made or not made.             Can I ask you about the language of (h)(1)?      Do you think it's -- do you think it's proper to consider a period of delay that precedes the filing of the motion?           That is, a period of delay in order to prepare the motion, as a delay resulting from a proceeding that has not yet occurred?             The grant of the motion is the proceeding?            Is the proceeding.              And you say the order is a proceeding for that purpose, the order granting the extension of time?
08-7412 +++$+++           You mean the trial judge under Florida law does not have discretion to choose a lower sentence because of the -- of tender years of the defendant?          What about historical perspective?     I mean, you might appeal to the fact that at common law, which was in effect when the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause was adopted, 12 years was -- was viewed as the year when a -- when a person reaches the age of reason.     And -- and the death penalty could not be inflicted on anyone --          -- and all felonies were the death penalty.          And then we apply a totality of the circumstances test --          -- which means whatever seems -- seems like a good idea.          I suppose you could say the same thing of -- of adults, of somebody over 18.             You really can't tell how redeemable this individual is until he is in prison for some time; and, therefore, you should not give anybody life without parole.             They -- they may all be savable.        So we should defer -- defer. We shouldn't have any non-parole sentences.             Everybody should be evaluated, which was indeed the approach that -- that many jurisdictions used to take.             Wasn't that so --          -- when there was parole for everybody?             I guess there s also no empiricism on whether the committed juvenile feels a lot better knowing that he will get out when he is 75 years old than he would feel knowing that he was there for life.             Do we have empirical studies about how much that improves the spirits of the committed juvenile?          Well, we are not sure that those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence amounts to life without parole.         Maybe a 70-year sentence does.
08-7621 +++$+++           You are speaking too fast. I can't understand you.          Wait.        I -- I don't understand what he's saying.              Can I understand this first?     He's there for the homicide offense or for the non-homicide offense?          Yes.          Right.          For the burglary, not for the --          If I understand you correctly, you are saying he could lose here on the procedural bar, and then win later in the State courts. Is that right?
08-769 +++$+++              Requires?             Oh.             It's such an unusual word. I haven't heard it in a legal argument in a long time.             It's just not significant value; significant artistic, educational.                  What are the others?     Scientific?             Strictly entertainment value doesn't count, does it?             And most of the hunting videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment. They like to see a hunt.               It could be that the reason hunting videos are still out there is that the producers were quite confident that this Court would not allow them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as this.             I really think you should focus, not on the educational value for -- to make people hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the opposite, it seems to me.           On the right under the First Amendment of people who like bull fighting, who like dog fighting, who like cock fighting, to present their side of -- of the debate. And unless it's a subject like obscenity, which from the beginning has not been considered protected speech, it seems to me that side of the debate is entitled to make its point as -- as forcefully as possible.     That's it seems to me what the problem is here.    Not --                You can create a lot of First Amendment horribles.            What about -- what about a new Adolf Hitler?     Can we censor any depiction of that new Adolf Hitler and the horrible things that he is proposing, including extermination of a race?                      Is that proscribable under the First Amendment?                      Is that any less horrible than the human sacrifice contemplation?             I would have thought that your response to Justice Breyer's comment about catering to people's worst instincts in the area of the First Amendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts. If -- if the First Amendment means anything, that's what it means.              It's not up to the government to tell us what our worst instincts are --              Except for those areas that have traditionally been outside the area of -- of protected speech, and -- and once you allow this one, what other -- what other base instincts do people have, besides this one? One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say, You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, the -- the movies cannot be made.             Adolf Hitler, can we keep him off the screen, too?
08-810 +++$+++            It's not the same question. When the court has held that 1 and 2 was, in effect, not in the contract because you didn't give enough notice of it.    So now you have a contract without 1 and 2 in it.           So it's a different question.     What does this contract mean without 1 and 2?     Now, you may have a different point, if -- if you say that what -- and it seems to me you did say this, that the court of appeal -- the court of appeals, not only decided that there was no notice and, therefore, this provision wasn't any good, but you claim that the court of appeals also said that you cannot account for the time value of money.          That -- now, that would be a totally different case.          But I didn't read it that way.        That's a little different.        Excuse me.         Are you talking about the court of appeals sending it back to the district court, or are you talking about the district court sending it back to the administrator?        We can handle those facts --        We can handle those facts just as easily as the district court.        We -- we don't have to look at the witness's demeanor.           I mean, just because a decision has some factual basis -- every decision has some factual basis.     That doesn't mean that -- that an appellate court, including this one, can't decide the questions.           Why do you keep stressing that -- you know, the district court was there and saw these facts?    That's fine --           What if I don't think it's the same terms?           So, in principle, if -- if we accept your argument, if other retirees who are later rehired bring a lawsuit in another court, you might have a different result because it would be up to the -- up to that court to decide what was -- what was a proper result, right?          That's the consequence of not deferring to the plan administrator.              You have --        Can we go back to the urns? (Laughter.)           Well, we interpret gaps in -- in documents all the time.                That's part of interpreting a document, figuring out what it provides for in a lot of situations that it does not explicitly cover.    I don't know why that isn't interpreting the plan.
08-861 +++$+++            Excuse me.         The President has adequate control over the SEC only because he can dismiss the chairman of the SEC.           But the activity here is not governed by the chairman of the SEC.                There s no role whatever for the chairmanship.              The -- the governance of this board is by the members of the SEC. So that's quite different from saying -- you know, I -- I think your syllogism breaks down at that point.           The chairman, which is -- which is -- which is the -- what should I say -- the knife that the President has into the SEC, has no role in the control of this board.            Excuse me, but, you know, Congress -- Congress can change the statutory authority of any agency just like that.             Does that mean that Congress is controlling the agency?            I'm not sure that -- that the ability to take away responsibility for an agency -- from an agency is the same as controlling what authority that agency does exercise.               It seems to me they are two different things.          No, that s --          But that's not true.        He can remove -- he can remove the chairman of the SEC.          And he cannot -- he cannot remove the commissioners.        And it's the commissioners that govern the board, not the chairman.            Would you please change it? Right?            I could do that. (Laughter.)          I did, I did. (Laughter.)          We did overrule it, by the way, in -- in Morrison, didn't we?          General Kagan, the government argues here that the head of department is all of the commissioners.         Elsewhere, it is the chairman of the SEC who -- who appoints inferior officers.              Now, which is it?     Are all those appointments by the chairman invalid?          Well, that's something quite different.     He makes the appointments.         They can overturn it, but the appointment must be made by the head of the department, and the appointments are not made by the commissioners.         They are made by the chairman.            Do you know any other agency composed of inferior officers that has the power to acquire its own budget, as this board does, by simply assessing a tax upon the people that it regulates?            The SEC can overturn it, but it's up to the board -- the board can do it.              Do you know of any parallel situation where there is a, supposedly, agency composed of inferior officers who have the power to tax the public unless it's overturned by somebody else?          But you can say the same -- you can say the same thing about Congress.          I mean, this is not the kind of control that an executive officer normally is supposed to have over inferior officers; when they do something, you can take away their authority.    Congress can do that.            Which is nothing, which is nothing.            I -- when I was OLC, I would -- I advised the President, you can't interfere with -- I think, if the President called up the FCC and said, I want you to rule this way, I want this kind of a rule from the FCC, I think there would be an impeachment motion in Congress.            Congress set up that agency to be independent from the President.              That was the whole purpose of it, wasn't it?          But it's okay for him to ask them?    It's okay for him to suggest to an independent regulatory agency that this is how he wants something done?          Do you know of any instance where that has happened?          But what does the Treasury Department tell the SEC to do?          It takes the initiative? The SEC doesn't request that information?          The SEC does not request that information; the Treasury Department just butts in? Is that it?          I understand, but --          I understand, but --          It's one thing for the SEC to ask the Treasury Department's view.               It's another for the Treasury Department to butt in.               Does it butt in?
08-876 +++$+++             But I don't -- I don't have the heart to inquire into that question if I think that the whole statute is bad.        And that's the point he is raising, that it's -- it's a predicate to our considering that question, that if you agree with him, you think the statute will be sustained. But if I think the whole statute is bad, what -- you know, why should I engage in -- in this exercise?              It doesn't make any sense to make me do that.             Well, just -- just so we -- we know what is -- what is going on here:                 It is not the case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute constitutional.     He doesn't say that. He says that if we adopt his interpretation, we can avoid reaching the constitutional question, because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that he asserts.    So he is not asserting that if we -- if we accept his position, the statute is constitutional.                      I don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.            What is -- I mean, I'm still waiting to hear what materiality consists.               It is just -- de minimus doesn't count?               Is that all you mean?               Excuse me --              But it -- it doesn't answer the racing form case.       I mean, you are using materiality in two senses.     All you mean by materiality is that the misrepresentation must have been material, okay?             So in the racing form case, let's say the question the boss asked is, you know, "Are you going to work hard this afternoon?     Or do I have to stand here and look over your shoulder? " And he says, "Boss, I'm going to work hard this afternoon. " "Okay, then I'll leave."             And the boss leaves.     That representation is material in that it got the boss to leave, whereupon he reads the racing form. But you know, that's immaterial in another sense, it's a -- it's not a substantial crime.             And that's -- that's what we are looking for here, something that -- that separates reading the racing form from really harming the employer --              -- to a substantial degree. And you have nothing in your -- in your brief or in your argument that eliminates these de minimus kind of -- what should I say --              Misrepresentations to the employer.             What if my son gets the money?   I don't get the money.            My son does.             It's an adult son.             And he -- and he sends him off to read the pre-MCNally cases.                And I have to tell you, they are a mess, I don't understand them at all. It's one of the reasons MCNally came out the way it did. Is -- you speak as though it is up to us to write the statute.    We can make it mean whatever it -- you know, whatever would -- would save it or whatever we think is a good idea, but that's not our job. What -- what does the statute say?                And, if all it does is refer us to the pre-MCNally cases, I'm at -- I'm at sea.                Maybe it was wrong.           Just because it understood it had a consistent core, it has a consistent -- consistent core?
08-88 +++$+++                 But it's not going to get you off. (Laughter.)              Excuse me, is that the proper remedy?   I mean, it seems to me he should appeal to the judge and say, look, this lawyer -- is -- is that the way you solve the problem of -- of an attorney who is not ready, like fire him so you can get another attorney?   That seems to me very strange.              Right.              And from what you told me it should have been given, right?              From what you tell me, it should have been given if indeed he was unable to prepare adequately for the trial?              But it doesn't say that; it really does say most of the delay was caused by the inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of the -- of the institution that appoints them, unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move the case forward.     That looks to me like --
08-905 +++$+++           Well, you're adding -- you re adding concepts to it, as well.          Nobody arguing before us intends discovery to mean actual discovery. Your -- you say constructive knowledge is enough; don't you?          That doesn't prove scienter, though.
08-911 +++$+++           Have they adhered -- have those other courts that you said originally said that other discretionary judgments made discretionary by regulation were non-reviewable, have they adhered to the -- to that view as to those other --          Oh, I understand.     I am asking:   Have they treated motions to reopen differently?          Has any of them, since switching to -- or since holding this with respect to motions to reopen, reaffirmed their view with regard to other discretionary judgments?          Are you going to talk about "under"? (Laughter.)           Good.           Where is this?           Oh, 6a of the government's --          Except that the text refers not just to the -- the discretion, it refers -- it says the authority for which is specified under this subchapter and the authority to issue that -- the authority to issue the regulation is under subchapter 1.          No.    You would have to say, no, Justice Scalia, if you want to win this. (Laughter.)           And, of course, if your interpretation produces the anomaly that Justice Breyer just described, the government's interpretation produces the opposite anomaly.     Right?          You said, earlier, that you had three examples --          -- that were not in your brief.    You better spit them out, or we won't know about them.     What are the other two? (Laughter.)           1227(a)(1)(H).   What s the third one?    And then I am going to ask you what the first one was because I forgot it.          Yes.     What was the first one?   Just -- just give me the -- the cite for the first one.   I didn't write it down.           I should have.          Thank you.
08-9156 +++$+++               Can I -- can I suggest -- it doesn't seem to me there's any -- any contradiction between the two.   (E)(1) addresses a factual finding. (D)(2), on the other hand, addresses the decision of the Court, which was based on, sometimes, just one factual finding, but, sometimes, many. So you -- you proceed, first, with (e)(1), and you -- you ask whether each factual finding on which the decision was based was shown by the defendant, either in the record, or if -- if you have an additional hearings, by new evidence, to be incorrect by clear and convincing evidence.      You do that fact-by-fact. Having found, let's say, two of the five facts.   To fail that test, you then go up to (d)(2) and say, okay, in light of the fact that two of the facts -- in light of the fact -- since two of the facts that the court relied on were false, was the decision vitiated by that reason, or was it nonetheless a reasonable determination? I mean, once you focus on the fact that (e)(1) applies to facts and (d)(2) applies to the decision, it's whether the decision was -- was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.
08-964 +++$+++            I certainly hope so.          Also you could say business methods apart from machines are not patentable.                 How about that?
08-969 +++$+++                 Excuse me.       Did -- was there some statute at issue in that case which required not just an interest, but an interest in property?             Well --            Why should that help?             So how can you call it -- I mean, part of the problem with calling it property is there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the amount owed here. Even if the Jenkins Act filing had been made, you still have to -- have to assume that this -- number one, you have to assume that the State would turn the list over to the city, which the State isn't required to do.            Well, that may be, but the State isn't required to, and the State can terminate that agreement whenever it likes. But, secondly, after you get the information we have to assume that you're going to move against these people.              Well, you follow up by writing them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is, when you wrote them a letter, about half of them coughed -- coughed up the tax.              They may have been the foolish half.   Did -- (Laughter.)              Were the other -- were the other half pursued by the city?              Not yet.         I don't --              It can't be worth it.         It can't possibly be worth it.              Reason on whose part?           Some reason on whose part?       On the seller's part or on the New York buyers' part?        They will be -- the New York buyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not going to pay taxes on it.          But it seems to me the seller couldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or not.   So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes, the seller has gotten what the seller wanted.              Usually you're not liable for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied on.   You really think that the -- that a large percentage of the people who were getting this stuff really, really were gulled into believing that New York State was somehow being done out of taxes?              Really?              No, I am sure the purchaser knows:   I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should pay taxes.     But you're -- you're telling me that the only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because of this misrepresentation that you don't have to purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes.                 I've known a lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that gullible.            Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking. I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of it.   It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to ship or transport, also receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no evidence of payment of applicable State or local cigarette taxes.            But there is no applicable State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these cigarettes.            That's not what it says. It makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear no evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and --            -- there is no applicable taxes at the time that they ship it.             Oh, I don't look at legislative history. (Laughter.)
08-970 +++$+++             -- for the lawyer who won a case.   You know, one grade for the case and the other for the lawyer.     But we don't do that. And if you do this going up, you've got to do it going down.   And you could expect the judge to say:   This is the worst performance I have seen in 28 years.   Judges don't do that in our system, and I don't think -- I don't think we should set up a mechanism that induces them to do it.          You say discretion.        I say randomness.   I mean, that is not a matter of discretion. It is a matter of randomness.            How -- how long has the judge who observed this case been on the bench? If he has been there just a couple of years, kiss good-bye to your -- your extra money for being excellent.    That's random.       That's not discretion.          So you want this Court to look to those cases -- you know, it's the world turned upside down.     Instead of the lower courts reading our cases, we have to read lower court cases to decide what this statute means.     Is that it?          I don't do that.          Yes.           Of course, this statute was passed before we adopted the lodestar approach, wasn't it?           Before this Court --          No.    I would think it cuts the other way.   Congress was not contemplating that we would adopt approach -- an approach which takes into account the excellence of counsel.
08-974 +++$+++           How do you -- the problem I have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except when you read subpart (k), it says  an unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established  if  a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race.          Which is what happened here.          They used --          Where -- where does it go on?   To say what?
08-992 +++$+++                Well, that may be, but where -- where do you get that from the opinion of the court of appeals here?       I find it very easy to get from the opinion of the court of appeals the proposition that if there is discretion, it's not a firmly established rule. Where do you get your theory, that they had changed it from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule at the time that the State court made this ruling? Where do you find that in the opinion of the court of appeals?               Well, that's -- that's a different issue.   Now, your -- your assertion is that what the court of appeals was based on -- decision was -- was not this that you are arguing now, but rather, it was based on the fact that there had been a change in the law from discretionary to mandatory. I can't find that, frankly, in the opinion, except in its reference to Doctor, so I have got to go back and read Doctor and guess that that's what they meant when they referred to Doctor. But assuming it's true, Justice Breyer says, even if it is true, what difference does it make? Because, even if they had changed from a discretionary to a mandatory, the trial court in the State had not realized that they had changed and gave him the discretionary. So what -- what complaint do you have?            If -- if the new rule was applied to him.            But the point is the new rule wasn't applied to him.            The trial court thought that it had discretion.            That's clear from the trial court's opinion, isn't it?            And they concluded that was ridiculous, so they stopped doing it.            Before or after his execution? (Laughter.)              Can I please --              Why do you pick 1984 as the time of the escape?      Whether it's an adequate or independent State ground, whether it's been consistently applied, it seemed to me -- it seems to me you should look to the time at which the State rule is applied. Now, as of 1984 I suppose there are some notice requirements that you can say due process requires, but I don't know why the adequacy of the State ground, whether it's consistently applied, should be judged on the basis of what was the law in 1984, rather than what was the State law at the time they applied the rule.
08-998 +++$+++               You -- you -- you have lost me.             Where is the 6-month -             No, I got -- I got it there.             I -- I -- I see.        I see.              Well, "know will happen" is quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought your test was likely to happen.              Not -- not likely, based on what you know.   Well, that's quite different from you know it will happen.              Is there a difference between your test and the Respondent's test?              That's -- that's "know will happen."   That is "know will happen."                   But I don't know how you can, at one and the same time, say:                    Courts shall not speculate, and then say that the test is "likely to happen."             I mean, to -- you know, to look forward and say:      Is it likely or not likely? That's speculation.     I don't know a better definition of speculation, to tell you the truth.
09-10245 +++$+++        Mr. Gannon, you assert that the -- within the language of the statutory provision, the sentence here is not based on the guidelines, but it's based on the agreement, and the agreement arguably is based on the guidelines.       If -- if you take that position, that "based on" means determined by absolutely, then I don't think any sentence would ever be based on the guidelines after Booker/Fanfan.       The guidelines form part of the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision is not based on the guidelines.     Just as here, the - the agreement -- the guidelines form part of what produces the agreement, so also they form part of what produces the judge's decision.     And it seems to me, if that's going to be enough for the judge's determination, it ought to be the same for the agreement.       No, but let's -- let's assume there is no plea agreement.       You -- you have a judge who sentences post-Booker/Fanfan.     Now, his sentence is not based on the guidelines any more -       -- any more than this agreement is based on the guidelines.     The guidelines are one of the things that he must take into account and does take into account in determining the sentence. Now, if that is enough for purposes of determining whether this statute -- statutory provision applies to a sentence imposed directly by a judge, it seems to me the same analysis ought to apply to a sentence imposed through a plea agreement.       So you -- you acknowledge that "based on" covers post-Booker/Fanfan sentences by the judge?       Even though -- even though the guidelines are just one of the things that have to be taken into account?       You were about to tell us where it is?       You're reading a different --       He is reading the commentary.
09-1036 +++$+++        Mr. Miller, do you -- do you really think Congress thought about this?     Do you think the members of Congress who voted for this bill thought about this -- this rather narrow point, about whether, if you file too late, it's jurisdictional or not?       So don't we pretty much have to go on what they wrote?       I'll bet you a dollar to a donut that -- that nobody thought about this narrow - narrow issue.     So it -- it ought to be a question of - of what this language ought to be taken to mean.     What's its fairest reading? Now, I'm not sure that means you win, but - but surely that's the issue, not -- not what --     you know, whether -- whether Congress could have been so mean.     They didn't think of this.       You -- you say that a copy of the notice is also sent to the representative, the American Legion or whoever, who has been representing the veteran?       Did Congress -- let's assume we -- we come out with a decision against the veteran.     Could Congress change the rule retroactively, including for this poor fellow?       And that wouldn't be contrary to any of our decisions because the government is the defendant and is essentially waiving its sovereign immunity?     Would that be the theory?       I mean, there has been - will have been a final decision in this case, right?       So can Congress say, you know, go back and do it over again and give it to this guy?       What other acts do you think would be swept up into a rule that we adopted here, that not all limitations on appeal time are jurisdictional?     The Hobbs Act cases; what else?       Well, I'm sure we'd say these are veterans, and I'm sure there -- there are other categories of sympathetic people who might come under the Hobbs Act.       But you haven't answered my question.       The Hobbs Act -       The dog ate it, maybe.
09-10876 +++$+++        I don't understand that. You mean so long as all -- all hearsay by non-police officers can be admitted without, without confrontation, just because they're not police officers?       I didn't think that was your point, because it's certainly not true, is it?       And that was prepared just for fun, not for use in trial?       So what difference does it make whether the statute requires it to be taken to be used at trial or whether the police send it over to be used at trial as a use of the State?     What difference does that make?       This analyst was fired, as I recall.     Was he fired, placed on administrative leave or something?       On leave without pay?       And do we know why it was leave without pay?       Does the defense know why it was leave without pay?     Could the defense have found out in cross-examination that the reason he was leave without pay because he was -- had shown himself to be incompetent, and they were in the process of firing him? I don't know whether that's true, but wouldn't that be important to the defense?       And didn't -- and didn't the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that this person would not have to testify, so that he could not be cross-examined?     Isn't that why they sent the substitute to testify?       I don't know what the facts are, but boy, it smells bad to me.     It really does.     And even if that was not the case, the mere possibility that it could have been the case shows why you should have to bring this person in if you want to introduce his testimony.       I agree that whether it's testimonial does not depend upon whether there's skullduggery or not, but the possibility of skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such as this, is a good reason for saying this is testimonial.       Well, not the same information.     One would say the police submitted it and the other one would say the defendant submitted it, right?       So if the police submitted it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know that the police submitted it, I assume.       Why is a key question whether this was an interrogation?     Does the Confrontation Clause apply only to confrontations?     To interrogations?     I mean, if a -- if a witness, before the police ask any questions, blurts out, you know, "Jones did it," can that statement get in because it has not been in response to an interrogation?       It would be different because interrogation doesn't make any difference.     That is not the condition for the application of the -- of the Confrontation Clause.       If it were an interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v. Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any - any relevance whatever.       Well, he'd look at the report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a lot of these reports.     But then the prosecution in direct would say, well, how do you do them?     And he would say, I always do this, I always do that, I always do the other thing.     Did you do it in this case?     Well, I don't specifically remember this case, but I always do it.     And that's the testimony that would go to the jury. It would be pretty persuasive.     Not as good as if he did remember.       The chain of custody wasn't -- wasn't contested here, was it?       Is it often contested?     My impression is it's not very often contested.       General, I know your State takes a different view of it or you wouldn't be here, but aren't there are a number of States that -- that do provide the testimony of the technician, who do require the technician to come in and -- and testify?       And have they had, to your knowledge, serious problems about defendants contesting chain of custody simply because this other thing is required?     Again, I'm -- I'm not aware that that's been a problem.     I think it's a boogeyman.       Well, I -- I don't think that's an accurate response, at least if you include the qualification that Justice Breyer put in the question, which is that the records were kept with the knowledge that they would be introduced in -- in criminal trials. I mean, you can say that all the records of labs -- let's assume there's a -- there's a police lab which -- which only does police testing of blood.     Those would be business records of the lab, but they certainly would not be introducible just because they're business records.     If the record is made for the use in prosecution, surely it's -- it doesn't come under the business records exception, or else we wouldn't be here today.       It's an independent lab and police always send it to this independent lab, but in fact it's an independent business, it makes a profit; but all the stuff it does it knows is going to be used at trial.     That wouldn't be admissible, would it?     Even though it's a perfectly normal business record.       General, I -- I don't want to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think you can answer yes or no.     Does New Mexico assert the same rule as applicable to ballistics testing?       Why?       Certainly not.       But you -- you -- you think the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and - that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet, and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that would be okay?
09-1088 +++$+++        Yes, but, look, you say that, even on the basis of the facts before the California court, your client deserved relief.     That may well be, but that's not what the -- what the Ninth Circuit said.     The Ninth Circuit said that your client deserved relief in light of the facts before the California court plus other facts. Now, I'm not going to go back and answer a hypothetical question of whether, if the Ninth Circuit said on the basis of those facts alone that were before the California court, if -- if the Ninth Circuit had said that, would that opinion be affirmed?     That's not the opinion they came up with.     They added facts.     So it seems to me that you have to live with what they wrote. And the basis of their decision included additional facts.       That's your very point, isn't it?       Page 35.     I've spent all that time.       Mr. Kennedy, can I bring you back to page 35?     The -- the court of appeals' opinion, Ninth Circuit's opinion, says, "Accordingly, if 2254(e)(2) were to limit the scope of the evidence before us, it would exclude only the new mental impairment theories" -- the new mental impairment theories -- "introduced in federal court, and their exclusion would not affect our result." The State contends that there -- there was other factual material, not just those theories but also the 6-and-a-half-hour time sheet evidence.       So at least, you know, that really doesn't cover the waterfront of -- of all new evidence.       To say that they were on record in the State court is not to say that they were part of the record, of the trial record.     And these things were not part of the trial record, right?       All -- all that goes - goes to the fact-finder?       All that goes to a jury in criminal cases?       Yes, but that -- that was on the assumption that the only new evidence would have been the evidence of -- how did they put it?     "The new mental impairment theories introduced in federal court." That that's the only new evidence that would be -- would be excluded.     And the other side contradicts that.       I wouldn't believe that.     I mean, you had nothing to support it.     I mean, I'd say that's just lawyer's puffery -       -- whereas you come up with a record that shows 6.5 hours.     I mean, that's something.
09-11121 +++$+++        Some people don't -- some people don't read the sentence.     He may not have read it. (Laughter.)       He probably couldn't leave the classroom, either, could he, the classroom where he was studying?       So the -- the additional coercive effect of not being able to leave probably didn't make a whole lot of difference.     He knew he was stuck where his parents had put him, in the school.     And if the school sent him to a classroom, he had to be in the classroom; and if the school sent him to a place where he could, if he wished, voluntarily speak to the police officers, he had to be there.       The blind person doesn't have a different mind.       The deaf person doesn't have a different mind.     He just has less data, and it's easy to take account of less data; easier to take account of less data than it is to take account of how different one's mind is because he's 16 instead of 13 or whatever.     That's the difference between the blind and the deaf, isn't it?       The officer doesn't have to think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a 60-year-old judge would think a 13-year-old thought, right? (Laughter.)       Why don't we require Miranda always?       Is there any harm in requiring it always?     It's always easy to do.     Why don't we require it all the time?     Can you tell us why it makes a difference?       We don't want Miranda warnings to be given where they are unnecessary because they are only necessary to prevent coercion, and where there's no coercion, we want confessions, don't we?     And the Miranda warnings deter confessions.       Isn't that the basic reason?       So it's not cost-free to require Miranda warnings.       It's a good thing to have the bad guys confess that they're bad guys, right?
09-11311 +++$+++        These were all litigated cases?       Suppose you have a State that has a separate crime for trespassing, criminal trespass.     And you're saying that if -- if you could show that a large number of cases that were brought under criminal trespass in fact could have been prosecuted under burglary, then criminal trespass would qualify as a -- as a violent felony.     That doesn't seem -- that doesn't seem to me right.       Just because prosecutors make that choice, that doesn't establish that the elements of the crime, which is what we focus on in deciding whether it's a violent felony, fill the bill.       Do -- do words mean nothing?     I mean, we're talking about a violent felony. That's what the Federal law requires.     And -- and you want us to hold that failing to stop when a police officer tells you to stop is a violent felony.     That - that seems to me a -- a big leap.     I mean, words have some meaning, and Congress focused on violent felonies.       What about speeding, just -- you know, you're going 15 miles over the speed limit?       Is that a violent felony?       Not necessarily risky. Conduct that shows disrespect for the law.       Or even if it isn't risky, you should not thumb your nose at the police when they tell you to stop.       Risky or not.       But he's saying even when it's risky, it's not aggressive.       You can be risky and not aggressive, can't you?       But they're mentioned; they're mentioned.     They're mentioned, and you're trying to get this in under the residual clause.       I'm -- this is greater or lesser for purposes of what?     Double jeopardy?       I just don't follow that argument.     I mean, it -- it seems to me that, yes, you could -- you could run afoul of (B) by committing an offense under subsection little (a) in some other ways, but if you run afoul of (B) by committing the offense of -- of flight from a law enforcement officer, it seems to me that that automatically includes (A).
09-11328 +++$+++        I assume if Petitioner says we should be able to overrule our prior substantive precedent, he should also logically say that we should be able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the exclusionary rule.     So that whenever somebody wants to come up here to challenge prior precedent, he can just say:     You know, Your Honors, we're asking you to overrule two cases:     The first one, the substantive rule of Fourth Amendment law; and secondly, whether that - that change in law can govern the action of the policeman who didn't realize that the law was going to be changed.       And if he asks for the double overruling that I just suggested, I guess there's some chance that the Court would do it?       I don't think it's so complicated, counsel.     Don't worry about it. (Laughter.)       Actually, why don't we just abolish the exclusionary rule?     That would be really simple.     Whatever evidence tends to prove the truth comes in.     That would be a very simple system if we're looking for just simplicity, wouldn't it?       You're not proposing that, though?       I assume that an officer when he goes out to do his job does not have primarily in mind not to get sued, but I think primarily in mind he wants to arrest somebody in such a manner that the person can be convicted of the crime that he's done, right?       I don't think we'd look particularly good, either, do you?     I mean, if. We had one case raising a Fourth Amendment question, and let's say six others who raise -- that raise the same question, what would we do?     We would grant the first and hold the second?     No use to hold the second, because they're going to lose anyway, right?       So I guess we would -- we would just grant the first and deny all the rest, even though they're raising the same issue?       It doesn't smell very good.
09-115 +++$+++        Perhaps Congress never expected that the States would have to resort to such massive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if - if the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously enforced, right? You -- you didn't -- didn't have any notion of doing this sort of thing in 1986, did you?       So maybe Congress wasn't worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that anything like that would occur.       Do -- do you make it mandatory?       You just -- you just don't get the safe harbor.     Isn't that the only consequence?       Does this lawsuit challenge that?       You're under the old law, and the only -- the only sanction is you lose the safe harbor, if that's a sanction.       So you think after this case we could look forward to cases, one by one, for all the various types of licenses?     Those would be as-applied challenges and would not have been resolved by this case.       We're really wasting our time here, aren't we?       So, are you -- are you conceding that any variation from the Federal standards for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically precluded? I mean, as I read the exception, it's an exception for State licensing and similar laws.     And it doesn't say "so long as those licensing and similar laws go no further than what the Federal Government has done."     I mean, we often allow States to impose regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory requirements that the Federal Government has imposed, and that is not automatically considered to be pre-empted.     So why -- why are you conceding that Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal Government says?
09-11556 +++$+++        I was going to ask that. She said that -       -- your -- your friend said that it was raised below.     What -- what happened to it?
09-1156 +++$+++        If it was the only product they sold, that might be enough -- 5 adverse reports out of 10 million?     If -- if that's the only product they make, you say, totality of the circumstances, that may be enough?       I don't know that -- if scienter is -- it seems to me ridiculous to -- to hold companies to -- to irrational standards.     And we did - and we did say in -- in Basic that it's viewed - whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor. And -- and you are saying, well, the reasonable investor takes account of the irrationality.     I don't think that's what we meant in -- in Basic.       Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm not clear on why you can draw a distinction between materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue before us here. If, indeed, satanic effect is enough for materiality, you say, well, it may not be enough for scienter.     Why?     I mean, if the company knows that satanic effect is material, then the company has - knowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect is irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter, if it's material? The scienter is withholding something that is material, that is known to be material, and once you say that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the company thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it in its report, no?       So there's no difference between the materiality issue and the scienter issue.       You can't push this problem off onto the scienter side of the equation.       Mr. Shah, what do you think -       What do you think about Satan? (Laughter.)       They haven't said that. They haven't said our sales are going to double. They're just rocking along at normal sales.       And they find out that percent of nutty-nuttys out there are not going to buy their stuff because of Satan.     Okay?       What about that?       So the Government's position is that reports of adverse effects that have no scientific basis, so long as they would affect irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming the company has said we're doing well, right?       Well, I mean, if Satan comes in, surely lousy science comes in as well, no?
09-1159 +++$+++        Is that patent law or is it regular contract law?     Doesn't it apply in other fields as well?     I mean, I'm -- I'm not aware that this is a peculiar doctrine applicable to patent law.       To do it in the future.     If somebody else gets an assignment before that agreement is -- is executed, the assignment prevails.       It could refuse to fund.       It could refuse to fund without a clear assignment upfront.       The Federal Government hadn't been doing much with the parents that it acquired automatically?       That's the reason they gave it to the university or to the private sector.
09-1163 +++$+++        All the rules of an agency would -- would be sucked in, wouldn't it?       I mean, all the rules the agency promulgates are supposed to be enforced by the personnel of the agency.       They become personnel rules and practices.       I suppose the Office of Personnel Management has a pretty broad charter, then, on your theory of what the adjective means.     OPM must be a very powerful agency. (Laughter.)
09-1205 +++$+++        I'm -- I'm the -- I'm the party trying to bring the later class action, and you tell me I can't do it because somebody else sought a class action, and -- and it -- and it was denied.     And I say:     Well, I don't care.     I -- you know, that's somebody else.     That was not me.     I was not -- and not only was I not a party to that case, I think that person had a lousy lawyer, and had I chosen the lawyer, we wouldn't have lost that point. What's your response to that?     You cannot even say, as you can where the class has been certified, well, at least there was a determination by some judge that the absent parties were adequately represented. There hasn't been even that determination.       Well, you do that ex post.       You want to litigate this later, and -       But it -- I'm sorry.       How can you -- how can you possibly find that in the first action the lawyer understood that he was acting in a representative capacity?       He tried to act in a -- but -- but his representation was denied.
09-1227 +++$+++        Well, in a -- in another case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion not to - not to prosecute this woman, or at least not to prosecute her under the antiterrorism law that gives her years.     Isn't that something for the State to be concerned about?     We want to have the discretion of whether to prosecute or not for standard crimes that have no relation to interstate commerce or any other Federal power.       She wants to make the argument that the definitions don't overlap.     She wants to make the argument that this is a strictly State, local crime, and that any -- any attempt by the Federal Government to convert it into a treaty-based terrorism crime is -- is erroneous.       That's what she's trying to do.     Why doesn't she have standing to make that argument?       But it does -- it does assume, as Justice Kennedy said, that the reason that is there in the Constitution is only for the benefits of the States, and not for the benefit of the people in the States.     So if a State chooses to give it away, the - the individual has -- has no standing.     You say it's third party, we're raising the States' rights.     I think what the other sides is arguing; this is not a right of the States, it's a right of the individual to have the State take charge of certain matters and the Federal Government take charge of other matters.     I don't see why that's any different from an Article I, section 8 claim.       There -- there's a question of causality, so some of them will -- will not be valid because you can't show that the -- that the State was coerced into doing something and therefore you can't show that the violation of the Constitution caused your injury.
09-1233 +++$+++        They didn't take any evidence on the point, I thought.       Current conditions?       What was -- what was your friend talking about when he said that they rejected any effort to show the current situation?       This was in 2008.       And when was the remedy imposed?       That was in the -- in the one-judge court, in the district court, wasn't it?       Well, what do you mean they can do it?       Of course, they could do it safely if they built, you know, umpteen new prisons, but that -       But that's -- you know, that's pie in the sky.     That's not going to happen.       What -- doesn't good time credits let -- let people out who would not otherwise be out?       But -
09-1272 +++$+++        The -- I'm sorry.       Loudly.     Is any of that unlawful?     Is -- is knocking loudly on the door unlawful?       Is it -- is it unlawful? Is -- is saying "Open up, police" -- is that unlawful?       And we had a case some years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we look in your luggage?     And the -- the -- the mules who were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say, oh, of course.     Just to show that they had nothing to fear. And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected in that fashion. We didn't say that's not fair because you're taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these - these poor criminals.     We said that's perfectly okay. And it seems to me the same thing is going on here. These people could have answered the door - there's a policeman knocking on the door; all he's saying is "Open the door, open the door" -- and say "Yes, what do you want?"     Say -- you know, blah, blah, blah.     They say "Well, get a warrant."     Shut the door. They didn't do that.     But everything done was perfectly lawful.     It's unfair to the criminal?     Is that -- is that the problem?     I really don't understand the problem.       But I -- you -- you might have considerable support on the Court for the proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created by unlawful activity by the police, which would include conveying the impression that they are about to kick the door in, then -- then you have a different case.     But - but I thought the case we had before us is what if the police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion inside, does that justify their going in? And that's what I thought we took the case for, and that's a different question.     You're trying to -- you're trying to make the police officers' actions unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions were unlawful you have a different case, and probably the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't think we were here to decide that, whether they knocked too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door. The opinion below says if they created the exigent circumstances, whether they did so lawfully or unlawfully, they cannot go in.     And that's, that's the issue.       That wasn't the basis for the decision below, though.     The court below didn't say these police officers were behaving as though they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door.     The opinion below just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances, but they were the result of the police knocking on the door and saying "We're the police."       Do you have any doubt that it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst into a home?       So why do you need unreasonable?     If, indeed, there -- there was a threat of imminent entry -- we're going to bust down the -- if that was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.       The problem is that as reasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was used by the court below, and you want us to affirm the decision below, which simply said if the exigent circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police action, whatever the police action was -- lawful, reasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded. How can we affirm that decision as you want us to do, even -- even applying your test?
09-1273 +++$+++        Well, wait.     Is the -       Third-party beneficiary rights are part of normal contracts, but the third-party beneficiary has rights under -- under the normal contract only when the parties intend him to have rights.     It's not that every -- every contract which - which has a benefit for some person allows that person to sue.     There has to be an intent.     And I -- I have trouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on the part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have had that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did not have the intent to allow private individuals to sue?       Yes, you didn't -- you didn't hear my question.       My question was the mere fact that there's a duty to a third party in the normal contract does not give that third party the right to sue, only if the contracting parties intend the third-party beneficiary to have a right to sue.       Well, I thought the -       But the Government's footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract.     It says that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis that the court applied in the District of Massachusetts case, but it was explaining why, in the Government's view, it's a different situation. And what it said, it's a different situation, not because of a different contract, but because in that other situation, Medicaid -- the Medicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, "a cooperative Federal-State program." I mean, their point is that the States are explicitly given authority for enforcement in that.       And here the entities you're representing are not.       The big -- the big difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the States are sovereign.     They can enforce their own laws. The entities at issue here are not sovereigns.     They're not enforcing their own laws.     They are trying to enforce Federal law.     But under the -- under the Medicaid program, the States, using their own fraud - fraud actions, whatever else, have a role to play.
09-1279 +++$+++        Excuse me.     Why does that relate to their privacy?     I don't understand that.     Why does that relate to the corporation's privacy interest? Anything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a privacy interest?       Anything that hurts the - the -- the image or the goodwill of the company?       Mr. Klineberg, can you give me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot about the adjective "personal."     But we're not talking just about the adjective "personal."     What about the phrase "personal privacy"? "Personal," yes, can indeed apply to corporations sometimes, but there are certain phrases where it clearly does not.     For example, you talk about personal characteristics.     That doesn't mean the characteristics of General Motors.     You talk about personal qualities.     It doesn't mean the qualities of General Motors.     You talk about a point of personal privilege.     It's not a privilege of a corporation. And I think personal privacy is the same thing.     Can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the personal privacy of a - of a corporation?     It's a very strange phrase to me.       Yes.     I'm not talking about that.     I'll grant you that -- that "personal" could sometimes refer to a corporation, although the Government distinguishes it by etymology and so forth. Never mind that.     I'm talking about personal privacy. Do you have any examples from the New York Times, from, you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to the interests of a corporation as the "personal privacy" of General Motors? I cannot imagine somebody using the phrase like that.       Another reason might be that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal privacy would cover this.       But if Attorney General Levi's description, which was -- which was issued for the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal Government what this new statute meant -- and it had a lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about - about this subject, you'd have thought somebody would have objected. I mean, did some members of Congress who - who had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about the personal privacy of General Motors?     I'm not aware of any objections along those lines.       Is it the burden of the Government to show that they intended to exclude corporations, or is it your burden to show that this exception was meant to include corporations?     I would think the latter is where the burden lies in this case.       Well, but if you're asking the Government to show that the -- there was an intent to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their burden.     I think it's your burden to show that this exemption was intended to include corporations.
09-1298 +++$+++        Let's talk about "moving party."     I -- I don't -- I don't know that "moving party" means who comes into court first.     I would -- I would -- in the -- in the context of a contract dispute, I would say the moving party is the party who is trying to use principles of law to change the contract, and that's the government here.     The government -- the government is blowing the whistle; it is the government which is saying you are in default, and under the law, since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we can claim the money we've already paid you.       That seems to me the moving party in the -- in the context of a contract.       Reynolds was talking about that because that was the fact situation in Reynolds. But I'm saying that the logic of the matter -- the logic of the matter when applied to a contract situation such as this ought to be the party who is blowing the whistle, who is trying to use the law, the one -- the one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this result.     And then we say, well, we can't tell whether the law requires this result or not.     That, it seems to me, ought to be the moment of truth.       It wasn't the undoubted right of the government before the lawsuit was filed. It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the contracting officer was correct that there had been a default.     If he was wrong about that, it was not the right of the government.       No, but they -- they claim that you knew that it was impossible to do what they contracted with you to do at the weight of plane which they promised to come across with.     They say that you knew that because of -- of other contracts that you had had, and yet didn't -- didn't tell them about it.       I don't know whether that's true or not, and we're never going to know it's true, because you came in and blew the whistle and said: State-secrets privilege.       Are you saying it was not impossible to do it at that weight?       At the weight contracted for?       I don't care how the contract's written.     I mean, if we're going to -- if we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that we're not going to try to apply the contract because we can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong, it's totally irrelevant what the contract says.     You just leave the parties where they are.       You're -       To a moving party, and you are never the moving party. (Laughter.)       It's granting nobody relief.     We're leaving you where you are.     "Get out of here," is what we're saying. (Laughter.)       We don't know what the answer is, so go away; we leave you where you are. (Laughter.)       That assumes that the contracting officer's termination for default was valid. And we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want to have to inquire whether it was valid.     So to say "go away" means everybody keeps the money he has.       Why is that unliquidated? I didn't get the distinction between -- why is the 1.35 unliquidated?       What's the other?     What's the -- what's the other 1.25 billion -       -- that he's also asking for?       Right.
09-1343 +++$+++        What if a manufacturer tells a distributor:     You have international distribution authority; you can sell my machine anywhere in the world, sell as many as you can anywhere in the world -- that would include the United States, right?       And, therefore, it would include New Jersey?       I know; it's a hypothetical.       It would include New Jersey.       Purposeful availment of the government of New Jersey?       I mean, availment doesn't mean much if that's all it means.       You tell somebody distribute in the world and you are availing yourself of the government of New Jersey?       But -- and I assume that if we do this to a company in England, any country in the world, and we say that this satisfies due process, we would have to honor a judgment from Bangladesh based upon -- against an American company, based upon a similarly modest degree of -- of availment, right?       Just as -- just as modest as what you propose here, or as extensive.     I don't mean to demean the degree of it here.       But the same kind of contact in India, which has different -- different States in India.     And -- strike Bangladesh.     Make it Madras, okay?       And we would have to honor a judgment by a court of Madras against an American manufacturer who had as little contact with Madras as exists here.       We would have to?       That's true when there's a proper jurisdictional basis, which is what we're talking about here:     What does the United States mean when it says there is a proper jurisdictional basis?     Is all that the court in Madras needs what existed here in order to hold an -- an American manufacturer liable? That's -- that's a little scary.       If you interact with somebody from New Jersey, you have -       -- committed availment of the government of New Jersey?       There are a lot of people from New Jersey. (Laughter.)       He didn't tell them -       -- to just seek out a person from New Jersey.       He told them to talk to people.       Suppose the company in Nottingham only sells to the United States.     It's the only place its machines are -- are marketed.       Then the component manufacturer would be liable in New Jersey?
09-1403 +++$+++        But -- but why do you -       Which means you would lose. I -- I mean, which means that the plaintiff would lose. But it doesn't mean that there is not a common issue, that the -- that the latter question, whether in fact the market was affected or not is, is not a common question.     Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a common question.       I thought that the whole reason you -- you say that the class certification stage is so significant is precisely because once the class is certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants that they're inclined to throw in the towel.     Now you're telling us that you -- you want to move discovery up to the class certification stage?       I -- I -- I'm sure it wasn't your point, but - (Laughter.)
09-1454 +++$+++        So, you want us -- so Munsingwear.     You don't want us just to leave it sitting because there's no controversy; you want us to erase that holding below, right?       Well, then -- then the answer you just gave doesn't make any sense.     You say it can -- you know, it can arise again.     That would be the answer of someone who wants us to eliminate the holding here:     Don't worry; it will come up again in a context where, on appeal, somebody will have an interest in arguing to -- to sustain it, but that interest doesn't exist here.     That's the argument you're making, but that's the argument of someone -       -- who wants us to Munsingwear.       I don't understand.     It seems like a very strange rule to me.     You mean it's okay for a child protection worker to just ask the child passing in the hall, you know, has your -- or not passing in the hall.     Come into this room, I have a question for you:     Has your father been abusing you? And if the child says yes, thank you, and the child goes, then that's okay?       Because it was a short interview?       Oh.       Right.     Take her into a room.     I see that.       But once they take her in a room, it depends on how long the interview is; is that right?       Whatever.       We're talking about rules for the future; we're not talking about this case, and you're asking us to adopt a rule for the future that says if it's very brief, it's okay, but if it's longer it isn't okay.     Right?     That's what you want us to adopt?       No, no, no, no.     Removed. There has been a seizure, but it's been a very brief seizure, just as a Terry stop is a very brief seizure.       So you're changing your position:     You need a court order, no matter how brief; is that it?       Oh, okay.       If you send her to the school nurse, it's not a seizure, but if the school doesn't have a nurse and it brings in a nurse from the outside and say, you know, we think you have some contagious disease, we would like you to speak to this -- then it becomes a seizure?       Contagious, it's just a disease that's going to kill this child and nobody else, okay? (Laughter.)       Okay.       So why doesn't it - likewise, it's not a nurse, but it's a social worker who's brought in to interrogate the child about something else that is going to very much harm that child, why is that any different?       It has nothing to do with whether there's a seizure, nothing whatever to do with whether there's a seizure.       The questions you ask after the seizure don't make it a seizure or make it not a seizure, do they?       She's helping you, I think.       But -- but that goes to the reasonableness of the seizure.     I was asking you about whether there has been a seizure.     Step one, has there been a seizure?     And you're saying that in a lot of these situations there simply hasn't been a seizure. Now, once there is a seizure, then we can inquire to whether it's unreasonable or not.     But -- but those are two distinct questions, and -- and we've been discussing the mere existence of a seizure.     Now, true in this case it was already conceded, but you're asking us to adopt a rule for future cases, and we can't adopt a rule for future cases until we know what we're talking about when -- when -- when we talk about a seizure.       Not always.     Not always. Only when there is no longer a case in controversy. In -- in many cases there will still be a case or controversy.       It will be something that could be replicated again in the future for some other reason.     It -- it isn't true that it will just eliminate the whole purpose of our -- of our jurisprudence in this area.     In many cases the -- the decision below can be appealed, and -- and we will rule on the -- on the constitutional question.       But you moved away, I mean if -- you know, it's a different situation.
09-1476 +++$+++        Well, let's talk about it. I find it difficult to believe that lawsuits are covered by the Petition Clause when it is very clear that the Congress can prevent all lawsuits against the Federal Government by simply refusing to waive sovereign immunity.     Now, you know, how can you have a constitutional guarantee of the right to petition the government, which you say includes the -- the right to -- to be in law court, and yet the Federal Government can exempt itself from suits in law courts?       I'm not talking about just a lower court system.     I'm talking about all suits, right up to the Supreme Court.     The Federal Government can say:     You can't sue us.       You're saying that the Petition Clause only covers those petitions that the government chooses to allow; is -- is that what the constitutional guarantee is?     If you choose to allow a certain kind of petition, it is constitutionally guaranteed.     That's not much of a guarantee.       What's the earliest English or American case you have that refers to a lawsuit as protected by the Petition Clause?       How many?       40 years ago.       So for a couple hundred years, nobody -- nobody connected the two?
09-1498 +++$+++        You're not relying on the 2009 -       You don't say -- you say this was wrong when it was decided?       Regardless of the 2009?       Mr. Fisher -- delay, you make an argument about the meaning of delay.     I am troubled by the meaning of the "from the filing of the motion" of that clause.     You read that, I think, to mean delay resulting from any pretrial moment and not to exceed -- right -- the peered of the filing of the filing of the motion to the conclusion of the hearing. Right?     Isn't that right?       Well, where do you -- where to you get that "not to exceed"?     It doesn't say not to exceed; it says delay resulting from the filing of the motion.       It's a funny way to say it. It's a funny way to say it.
09-150 +++$+++        I think your answer, counsel, is that we decided that in Crawford, from which Justice Breyer dissented. (Laughter.)       That's what we said in Crawford, isn't it?       Mr. -       Mr. Van Hoek, what is the basis for your concession that a dying declaration is an exception from the Confrontation Clause?       It is an exception from hearsay, for certain, but from the Confrontation Clause?       You conceded it.     It's been the whole basis for Justice Ginsburg's subsequent interrogation.       I thought it was an open question only -- only where the -- the defendant has effected the death of the person who has made the dying declaration.     I don't know of any cases that allow a dying declaration in over a Confrontation Clause objection.       If it hasn't been reached, if it is not an established exception to the Confrontation Clause, there is no basis for saying, therefore, the Confrontation Clause pertains only to reliability.     It pertains to the opportunity to cross-examine. And -- and reliability exceptions are what we used to do under -- under Reynolds.     If it was reliable, we let it in.       And the mere fact that it's reliable as a dying declaration instead of reliable as something else ought to have nothing to do with the Confrontation Clause decision.       The guy in the gas station is present.     It's not past.     He's making an assertion the guy who is now in the gas station shot me.     The "shot me" is past, but he's asserting that the person is now in the gas station.     That is a statement of a present fact.       Do it. (Laughter.)       I guess it depends on what you mean by "in the past," as Justice Breyer put it. Undoubtedly, under the regime of United States v. Reynolds, which was what, 25 years old - when -       Roberts.     I'm sorry.       Roberts.     I'm sorry. Roberts, which -- Reynolds was the Mormon case -- which was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided, yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it.     But if by what you mean is in the past, Crawford examined the past, and its conclusion as to what the past said is quite different from what Justice Breyer now says, although he joined Crawford.       Well, they can always do it.     You -- you don't say they can't do it.       They can always ask the questions.     The only issue here is not whether they can ask the questions, but whether, after they ask them, the answers can be introduced at trial.       Would they ask his name? God, it's really important for us to know, four students on the ground.     What's the name of the guy that did this? That's not the emergency.       They'd say

09-1533 +++$+++        I would assume that your major objection would not be that.     Your major objection would be:     We're not supposed to be writing a statute, we're supposed to be interpreting one.     And there is no way to -- to get that out of these words, no way, absolutely no way.     Is there?       Is it -       Is it not relatively common statutory drafting to include something in an earlier section which is also included in a later section that imposes a higher penalty?     For example, as I recall from my criminal -- criminal law courses, States have statutes that provide that the taking of a human life, homicide, is -- is punishable by so much; and then it says the taking of a human life with malice aforethought is punishable by more. Now, does -- does the second include the first?     Of course it does.     It includes the first and then something.     And it seems to me that's the same thing here.     It includes the first, the cocaine, but it has to be within a compound mixture of preparation.       Ms. Saharsky, coming back to Romanette (iii), you have 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause 2.     Doesn't - it really doesn't have to be a mixture.     It could be pure, couldn't it?     It says "mixture or substance," not mixture.
09-158 +++$+++               What -- what would happen if it had been sent back on this ground, but there was another ground that he had appealed on which the Court never reached?               Okay.        Would he still be able to raise that one on habeas?              Well, he'd have to bring them all in petition, too.           You can't say, you know, there are five that weren't reached and bring a separate habeas reach for each one of the five.                    At first habeas, you would have to bring all of them, right?             I guess if res judicata applied, you wouldn't bring habeas in the first place on an issue that was wrongly decided, right?              If it was decided res judicata.             And so your -- your habeas claim would be barred.
09-223 +++$+++                 I think your -                I think your answer is that relief that would violate the Tax Injunction Act is not appropriate relief.                And therefore not covered by your plea.             Makes sense to me.              Your next-door neighbor has to be a competitor of yours before it would be an exact parallel, right?             Counsel, I -- I hate to introduce another procedural glitch into this thing, but as I -- as I understand it, the State's motion to dismiss was under -- under 12(b)(1), which is a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and that was granted by the court.               The TIA is assuredly a jurisdictional statute, but I had never thought that the comity doctrine was a doctrine of jurisdiction.                  In fact, by -- almost by definition it says the court has jurisdictions but nonetheless should decline to exercise any.    You didn't make that objection, though.             You did not make that objection.
09-291 +++$+++        Yes, but if -- you know, if you concede that she could have sued, then what's the big deal?     Then we still have the same problem, that the employer doesn't know whom -- whom he has to treat with kid gloves. What's the difference whether, when the law comes down on him, it's -- it's she who brings the suit or her fianc?     He's worried about the suit.     He still doesn't know whom he has to be careful with.       Right.       Okay.     So that's your only point, not that -- not that it's going to be very difficult for employers to figure out who can be protected and who can't?     You abandon that -- that issue?       Okay.       Why would the -- the woman who caused the random firing -- why would she bring a lawsuit if these people are really nothing to her?     She just has a guilt of conscience or something?     I mean, I don't see why she'd bring the lawsuit.     If it was her fianc, maybe, but -       She might not even like the people who were fired. (Laughter.)       Okay.       You don't even have to agree with his description of what Sanders Brothers and the APA say.       I don't.       It -- isn't there a doctrine of -- of the scope of persons protected under the -- under a particular statute?       And doesn't the word "person aggrieved" bring that -- that whole lore along with it?       I'm not sure it's broader. Why do you say it's broader?     It says "adversely affected" -- "adversely affected" -- or "aggrieved within the meaning of the relevant statute."     And it's that language that says, well, the statute was only meant to protect this group of people, and the fact that somebody else was incidentally harmed would -- would not be covered. I don't know why you say that's broader.     If anything, it's narrower than what we have here.     We just say "aggrieved."     It doesn't say within the meaning of a relevant statute.     You want us to read that into it?       Ms. -       Go on.     I'm sorry.     Finish your -       I don't see where you're going.     The employer has to fire three fiancs or a larger number of - (Laughter.)       Well, you know, I don't know what "aggrieved" means.     I don't think anybody does.     Why shouldn't we be guided by the EEOC, which has responsibility for implementing this statute?     And they've come up with their theory of what it means, and we usually do accede to a reasonable theory proposed by the implementing agency.     Why -- why shouldn't we do that?       What's the function of the compliance manual?     What does it do?     Does it say we'll -- we'll leave you alone if you do this?       But they have to leave him alone.     There's really nothing the EEOC can do to somebody, right, except -- what, can the EEOC take them to court?       Well, so can the Justice Department, but we don't defer, thank goodness, to the Justice Department's interpretation of the criminal law, do we?       No.       22 and 23 of -       Okay.
09-329 +++$+++        You -- you get the notice with your next statement.     But you're talking about the purchases made before the next statement, right?       Well, you get notice if your rates changed.     It would show it, wouldn't it?       Right.       What's to figure out?     I mean -       If he had been paying, what, 10 percent and it's now 25 percent, it would seem evident on the face.     But that doesn't solve the problem of the purchases that you have made before you got that statement.       But the rate -- the rate that may be charged -       -- hasn't been changed. That still remains what it was.       Ah.     No, you're the one that's reading it to say something different from what it says.     It says the rates that may be charged.     That's the term, "these rates may be charged."     That term hadn't been changed.     You want to change it to "the rates that are charged."       Well, I think it's at least a horse race, and that brings us back to how much deference you give to the -- to the Board.       You're trying to make the argument that it's clear.     The fact that it says "may be charged" alone makes it unclear, it seems to me.
09-337 +++$+++              I think your wife made a mistake.     I don't think you made a mistake. (Laughter.)              19a of the petition?               I'm sorry.       I -- I am not following it.   Where -- where -- where --               Yes.     But he's talking about constructive notice --               -- by -- by the defendant, not constructive knowledge by the --              It says it includes stewards.    What do you -- what do you say to that?              It includes the stewards on the boat, according to your -- your friend.              Now, that -- that assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii), "knew or should have known," it says within the period provided by rule 4(m).        Now, in the early part of that period, at -- at one point in the period you should have known.   And at another point, because the answer was filed, you shouldn't have known.             And you're relying on the fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry -- that -- that you filed an answer which made it very clear to them what the situation was.                    But was there any point, any -- and all it takes I think is any point within that 4(m) period -- when you -- you knew or should have known?             Assuming -- assuming the lawyer would just look at the cover before he files a lawsuit?               I object to your relying upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says "is satisfied, if within the period provided by Rule 4(m)." And there is at least some point within that period before the answer was filed.                       And if, within that period before the answer, you knew or should have known that it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose. Do you understand what I'm saying?               And the -- the only thing you could rely on for that short period before the answer is filed is simply the ticket, right?             Well, you are reading "within the period" to mean "throughout the period."                      It doesn't say  throughout the period.                       It says  if within the period.             I think it's an important issue with respect to the statute.                   I don't think we can treat cavalierly whether "within the period" means "throughout the period."           That's one of the issues here.
09-338 +++$+++              Ms. -- Ms. MCCowan, you are -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the only question for us is whether it was an abuse of discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge here. That would certainly be the case if this is coming up through the Federal system and we had a Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but it is not.   It -- it is coming up from a State court and Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with State justice.   And that statute says specifically that where there has been a factual finding by the State court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing evidence. Now, what clear and convincing evidence is there here that there was not a deadlocked jury?             Well, what was the basis for that declaration of mistrial?             Right.             The Michigan Supreme Court's determination is simply a determination of the same fact:   There was a manifest necessity because the jury was deadlocked.             I mean, that factfinding is implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did, but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.             But our -- but our cases have required much -- much more than that, much more than referring to a generalized standard that our opinions have set forth.         They have required proving that the application of that standard in our opinions comports with the provision of the statute that requires you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. Now, our cases don't show that you can simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of discretion standard, that was clearly established by the Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion.               I don't think so.   I think our cases show you have to show that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover your situation.   And you don't have any cases like that.             That may be.       That may well be -             -- which says it's a terrible statute, but there it is.                It says it has to be contrary to clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. And you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established by an unbroken line of lower court decisions.               That's not what the statute says.             Well, maybe that's right and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be.                And you say:   Well, it also couldn't be.              That may well be.   But we are bound to accept the factual determination of the State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that that's wrong.              Don't waste your time.      I will look for it.              Don't waste your argument time.   I will look for it.             So the standard of review for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court of appeals despite AEDPA?            We simply look and see whether there has been an abuse of discretion.                   If there has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?               But it's objectively unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?               So it's not just abuse of discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something else?   Plus what?                But "objectively unreasonable" is already built into the criterion of abuse of discretion.        You don't abuse your discretion if what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the ballpark.   It seems to me you are doubling up here. I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.             Do you always have to poll the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement?             I am not aware that you would always have to poll the jury, and I could see some real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact.             It perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the holdouts.    I'm not aware that that's a requirement.
09-350 +++$+++        It's the same statutory language that you're relying on, right, that was held to require causation in the one case?     Why wouldn't it require a similar causation in the other?       Or there is no city policy.       But the test would be the same going forward, right?     The test would be the same -       The same test would apply to both damages, going forward after the date of filing of the suit, and injunction according to your reasoning, right?       From the time the suit is filed both -- the injunctive test will also be the damages test.       Let me follow this.     To bring a damages claim, do you have to show past damages, or can you just collect damages from the date you file suit?       Well, in -- if that's the complaint that you file, then -- then in that kind of a suit the test for damages and the test for injunction would be precisely the same, and you would be able to get damages on the basis of the mere fact that the suit exists, right? Because they wouldn't be fighting it if it wasn't their policy.       Mr. Pincus, why do you - why do you accept, as I think you did in response to the Chief Justice's question, that if the city has a policy which it believes is constitutional but in fact is unconstitutional, that is not a city policy for purposes of Monell?       Well, I thought you did.       Even if they think it's a constitutional policy, it's still a policy, isn't it?
09-367 +++$+++                Was it within the 90 days?               The restitution sentence was after the 90 days?                But it -- it -- it's sort of a ridiculous consequence that 5 years later, and the judge who tried the original case is dead. I think it's bad enough to have the issue of whether this victim suffered $100,000 damages decided by the judge, if that's what you re going to be sentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the judge who tried the case.            And under your proposal, it can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has been deceased.     That doesn't seem to me to make any sense at all.                Doesn't the statute establish time limits for filing an appeal?                Does it -- does it state a remedy for it?     I don't think so.               But if you don't comply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't file the appeal.                Same thing here.             Let me see if I understand this.   He has 14 days to appeal that.                  And if he doesn't do that, then later within the 90 days or even after the 90 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can -- he can appeal that sentence of restitution, right?              On the same grounds on which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of imprisonment, right?              If -- if it's an error in the trial, he claims:      I was innocent.              No?             What was that statute on imprisonment?             I've got it.             Even though there s no amount given?             Simply because when you state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an amount?     Do you do the same thing for imprisonment?             You say:    I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how many years, but I'm going to send you to prison.              Is that appealable right away?             I understand that, but district courts don't always do what they are supposed to.    And it seems to me a very strange result that you're --               This criminal judgment of restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the victim suffered so much money?               Does he find that beyond a reasonable doubt?              Just more likely than not?              And it's a criminal -- it's a criminal judgment?
09-400 +++$+++        Page 3 of the blue brief.       I think -- I think that you've misread -- I think that you've misread the "cat's paw" principle of the court of appeals.     I don't think that it is, to them, a determination of proximate cause at all. As I understand their opinion, they say that the statute requires that the -- let me get the right language here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited discriminatory factor must have been a motivating factor in the employer's action.     And they say that means it must have motivated the person who took the employer's action. It's not a motivating factor in the employer's action unless the person who took the action on behalf of the employer had that as its motive. Then the court of appeals makes an exception:     However, if the person who appears to be taking the action on behalf of the employer is really not the person who took the action, but was totally under the control of a subordinate who -- and the person just swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we will hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person who signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't have the motive, if in fact the decision was effectively the decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the employer. It has nothing to do with proximate cause. It has to do with the text that it has to be a motivating factor in the employer's action; not a motivating factor somewhere down the line, but in the employer's action.     That's how I read the court of appeals' opinion.       That's -- that's not the point.     It seems to me you have to -- we're not going to second-guess the jury determination here. I understood your point to be that there's a difference between a motivating factor in the decision, which means the person who made the decision on behalf of the employer must have had that motive and, on the other hand, a factor which was relevant to the decision, or a factor which influenced the decision.     That's quite different from a motivating factor in the decision. You -- you have to get us to believe -- and I'm not sure we will -- that "motivating factor in the decision" refers to motive on the part of the person who made the decision.     That's -- that's essentially your point, isn't it?       How does the Secretary of Labor administer this statute?     What are -- what are his or her responsibilities under the statute?       Can -- can I turn to the Secretary of Labor's regulations?     Are what we talking about anything more than the following statement in his commentary accompanying the final regs, namely that an employee, quote, "need not show that his or her protected activities or status was the sole cause of the employment action.     The person's activities or status need be only one of the factors that a truthful employer would list if asked for the reasons for its decision." Is that -- is that the only -       Well, this is the one that the Government refers to.       That doesn't seem to me to be so damning of your case.     I think if this employer had been asked the reasons for its decision, it would have given Ms. Buck's reasons.
09-448 +++$+++              Future claimants will not ask for summary judgment from the district court, presumably, in light of Conkright.                 They will ask that the case be remanded.       So, in future cases, will they have obtained a victory?             Well, we've -- we've already told them they can't get that.             The claimant doesn t -- doesn't really claim that.           The claimant just says this was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly. And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from the district court is a remand.             So he would not ask for money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your analysis.     If all he asked for was a remand, he got a remand.              What if --             Well, it's a trust -- trust law is at issue here, is the government's assertion.
09-475 +++$+++               Mr. Robbins, can I ask you about your clients  standing?             What individual plaintiff here stood to be harmed by what the agency had done?             Which one of them was -- was within, what, 5 miles of any -- any field of the genetically engineered alfalfa?             What?       From what?   From what?   From --             From somebody within 5 miles, 10 miles, 20 miles?             So you want the Court to assume that somebody is going to be planting a field of the genetically engineered alfalfa within, what, 5 miles of --             -- one of your named plaintiffs?             The fact is there isn't a single named plaintiff who -- who has -- has any claim that within the utmost limits of -- of risk, he is at risk currently.             I understand that.     But you have to bring in a member from that organization --             -- who is concretely harmed.             You -- you don't think the free market would produce companies that advertise:                  We only cut natural seed fields?             You don't think that would happen?     I am sure it would happen.             I am really losing you now. I thought he was referring to the number of farmers who would be planting and harvesting genetically engineered alfalfa.     Isn't that -- farmers who wanted to do it.                He was saying:     We now have 200,000; we are going to have a million.             All right.       Acreage, whatever. He s talking about acreage of farmers who plant and want to plant --             -- genetically engineered seed.             He s not talking about how many unwilling farmers are going to have infected fields.             Okay.             Well, I'm not sure we understood. (Laughter.)             It seems to me pretty doggone imminent if the agency has come before the court and said:   This kind of partial deregulation ought to be allowed, and we re in favor of it.                   I mean, you are not sending it back to an agency that s a blank slate.                      You know that the agency favors this degree of deregulation.             I mean -- I d -- you know, I -- boy, I d take a remand to the agency any day.              This isn't contamination of the New York City water supply.                It's the creation of plants of -- of genetically engineered alfalfa which spring up that otherwise wouldn't exist.                 It doesn't even destroy the current plantings of non-genetically engineered alfalfa.     This is not the end of the world. It really isn't. The most it does is make it difficult for those farmers who want to cater to the European market, which will not accept genetically engineered alfalfa. It makes it more difficult for them to have a field of 100 percent non-genetically engineered.                 But that's not the end of the world, Mr. Robbins.              I thought you were comparing it to New York City dying --              -- from poisoned water? (Laughter.)              And what happened with corn? You -- you -- you said -- gee, I was unaware -- I ve been eating corn all this time. (Laughter.)              What happened with it?             We -- we don't necessarily have to do that.    We just have to decide whether the lower courts did it.             I mean, if we concluded that they didn't do it, that would -- that would be enough, wouldn't it?   We wouldn't have to do it ourselves.              They also said stuff which suggests that they didn't do it.
09-479 +++$+++        But that would include (B). That would include (B).     (B) is part of the same subsection, isn't it?       So, you know, I -- I think what the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are just talking about (c)(1)(A), but it isn't obvious to me that if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition it's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd only get -- you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30 plus 10.       That isn't obvious to me. And -- and the "except" clause would -- would handle that.       Where is 930(c)?     Can you tell me where it is in the -       Wait, but it -- but it does -- it does subject them to less, at least with respect to those -- those enhancements set forth within the subsection itself.       Why?       And that's the only thing that that additional language which says "otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law" -- why didn't they just mention 3559(c)?       That's the only thing it covers, that tiny little thing, which has no effect at all, except for the benefit of the busy district judges, you say.     I -- I find that quite implausible.       It's one witness at a hearing?     At a hearing?     And you really think that the rest of the Congress knew about that hearing?       Well, wait.     I mean, the guidelines can't be, as Justice Breyer said, just like a mandatory.     They can't be, can they?       Oh, you did.     I quoted you.       Advisory.       Excuse me.     For other provisions anywhere in the code?     I mean, regardless of whether those provisions are being prosecuted in this particular indictment? I mean, you're -       You're saying that the other side has to say, well, it's only those that are in this -- in this particular criminal transaction, or only those in the particular indictment. Do you escape that necessity?
09-497 +++$+++               Is that -- is that right? Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a vacuum without taking into account State law at all? And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State court on the basis of a much more lenient standard than -- than if the court decided it de novo.                   But can he really disregard State law regarding unconscionability?                No -- I mean, you -- I thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the question of unconscionability.                And that's not my understanding.   My understanding is that he's -- he is obliged to take account of State law regarding unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it would be the district judge's call if this had gone to court, whether in fact this is unconscionable. Afterwards, there will be court review.                   And if he has totally disregarded all State law regarding unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis to set aside the -- the arbitration?             That doesn't mean -- does that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract is a contract to maim.      I mean, it -- you know, it's -- it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay?                  He's going to be able to exact a pound of flesh.                  Now, there are State laws which invalidate contracts to maim.                  Do you think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say, well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?             Can he ignore the State law?             Is that right?      You don't think a State court would in the blink of an eye set aside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh?             I think you have a misunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you believe.     I -- I think there s no doubt what would happen in that case.             You wrote that, didn't you? Didn't you write that opinion? (Laughter.)                Let's assume Nevada law says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right? And an individual is fired.             He goes to arbitration, or at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on it.    And he says, no, because I was fired in violation of Nevada law. Now, is it your position that that -- that that case would have to go immediately to court and could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times, that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?             Well, your -- your position seems to be that unconscionability is the same as coercion in the making of the agreement.                       And I don't know that that's true.             No, I don't care what we --             I don t care what we said in dictum.     It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is the same as duress or the same as fraud --             -- that you can -- you can be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable contract.     Now, the courts may protect you because you re stupid, but you haven't been coerced.                       Is there no distinction between unconscionability and coercion?             Why is that?             Why is that?      I would say all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement that s as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator. Which ones would have to go to the court?             Not much use signing an arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer. He s going to end up in court anyway.                     Every one of them will be acknowledge as unconscionable.                     So what s the use?             I mean, kiss good-bye to arbitration.             No?               The amici certainly claim the contrary.   The Chamber of Commerce claims that this is what s happening and that it has been a snowballing effect.              There --
09-520 +++$+++        I didn't understand your last answer.     What was it?       Yes, but I don't understand why you think it is -- it is more articulable on your theory than on theirs.     I don't see where solving your predictability problem, you're worried about it, you know, we don't know how to tax anymore.     I don't know why it's any more certain if we -- if we say the key is whether it's a generally applicable tax than it is if we say the key is whether it discriminates against railroads.     I mean it's the same inquiry.     So what do you care?     It's just as -- just as unpredictable ex ante.     It's exactly the same inquiry, whether it's generally applicable or whether it discriminates against railroads.     Isn't -- isn't -- isn't that what you have been saying?       So, it's twiddle dum or twiddle dee, maybe we should, you know, dismiss this as improvidently granted, it doesn't make any difference.       But you don't know what "generally applicable" means.       At least I don't know.     How do you know? (Laughter.)       How are these any different from property taxes?     I mean States could say the same thing about property taxes.     Nonetheless it was felt necessary to specify that -- that exemptions don't count.       Before deciding whether or not you are discriminating against the railroads.
09-5201 +++$+++                No, no, you don't measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin measuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from 311.   And if he has behaved well during all -- all of those 365 days, then you knock off another 51 days or whatever it is.       And you begin the third year from then, but you give him another 365 days to determine whether he has behaved well.               Right.              He did.          He did.   You didn't give him the credit until he served the whole 365 days.   At that point, he gets the credit and you count the second year as though it begins on day 311.             Exactly.             Except that they're not taking it off from the back end.                They are taking it off from the next year.       So that in the second year, if he -- if he behaves well for 365 days from 311 -- okay?                       He behaves well for the next 365 days.                      The next year will begin at 622. But then he has to serve another 365 days before he gets good time credit.                And then the next year will begin three times 311:             933.      And so forth.             Isn't that right?          See, he agrees with me. (Laughter.) No, I'm not saying that's right.                   I'm saying that that's -- that is what he is proposing.             I mean, we -- we wouldn't allow that -- those of us who use legislative history don't allow a congressman to come in several years after the bill has passed and say, oh, by the way, the reason we voted for that is thus and such.                    We would kick that out. Why is it any different for an agency's subsequent statement?              I don't think we sent cases back under Overton Park for an agency's description of history.    I think we sent it back for the agency to give a reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason or its past reason.       It -- it's the current reason that counts.              I'm -- I'm willing to accept the -- the government's assertion here that that's the government's position.              I don't think you are lying.             Even Justice Breyer has got it!   Whoa! (Laughter.)
09-525 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick, is that an accurate description of -- of the question before us?       Why didn't you object to it in -- in your -- in your opposition?       I don't -- but we -- we don't reevaluate facts.     We -- we review the holding of a lower court. Now, was this an accurate description of the holding of the Fourth Circuit?     And if it wasn't, why didn't you say that in your brief in opposition?       Did they make -       -- the statements?     Isn't that the statutory text that we're dealing with?       They did make the statements?       It didn't go out under their name.       If someone writes a speech for me, one can say he drafted the speech, but I make the speech.       That -- that's not what - it depends on the context of "make."     If you're talking about making heaven and earth, yes, that means to create, but if you're talking about making a representation, that means presenting the representation to someone, not -- not drafting it for someone else to make.       But if JCM falsely represented what it would do, it made that false representation to the fund, and the fund, as has been acknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM.       But that's not what's going on here.       What isn't clear from all of those things is that -- is that JCM made any representation to the public.     The representation was made in the prospectus issued by the fund, not by JCM. Now, the fund may have a cause of action against JCM, but what's crucial here is whether - whether you can establish that it is JCM who made the representation to the public -       -- and I don't see how you can get there.     You might proceed under the control provision, but -- but not by saying that they made the representation.       That's fine.     Just like writing a speech for somebody.       If I carry a letter over and file it on behalf of some principal, does it become my letter?     Have I made that representation?     Sure, they filed it.     What does that prove?       As you say, they have no other agents, unless the trustees themselves were going to walk over and file it.     JCM was functioning in that capacity as an employee of the fund in the filing.     They didn't file it on their own behalf.       On their own behalf?       Common-law suit for duping.       Mr. Frederick, I thought we had held -- I was sure we had held that there is no aiding and abetting liability -       -- under the provision we're discussing here.       Do you deny that the fund had substantive control?     Couldn't the fund have stopped this statement from being placed in its prospectus? Didn't it have outside lawyers who advised it whether it should allow this statement to be included in its prospectus?     How can you say that they -- they didn't have control?       Well, that may mean that they're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have control.     They had control, but you say they -- they were duped.     But that's quite a different theory from saying that they had control -       -- that they didn't have control.       I don't think that's a reasonable interpretation of -- of make a statement indirectly.     I mean, you can make it indirectly by not issuing it yourself but having somebody else make it in your name.       But I would not say that I'm making a speech indirectly if I have drafted the speech.       The person for whom I drafted the speech is making the speech.       Well, that will always be charged.     It's the simplest thing in the world to charge scienter.       And you've bought yourself a big lawsuit.       Well, it should change that, because Congress has made it very clear that investment advisers are not to be treated like employees.     You -- you want us to undo a clear distinction that Congress has made.
09-529 +++$+++        A dignified sovereign should not agree to the deal. (Laughter.)       I mean, you know, the Commonwealth had the choice.     It had two choices, as - as counsel for the Government said.     It could either turn down the money or, if it's not dignified enough to do that, it could take the money and establish a private organization to do this work instead of a State agency. So, what -- you know, what complaint do you have here?       Why -- why is it an extension?     I mean, I have sort of a bit of a problem with that.     Why is it somehow a -- a greater infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake - he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa.     And yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when - when you allow a State agency to sue a State? I don't -- I don't see why that's so horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it somehow destroys the State system of separation of powers.     But that's a different question, and -- and the answer to that is simply you did it yourself.       And -- and that has independent litigating authority.       Okay.     I mean, that's the difference here.       This agency was given independent litigating authority.       So your argument is really -- really is a sovereign immunity argument.     You're saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex parte Young to a suit in Federal court where the suit is by another State agency.       So sovereign immunity is part of your argument, but -       So you -- you would acknowledge that if a State knew when it took the money that it was -- and when it created a State agency to administer the program, that it was letting itself open to suit in Federal court under an Ex parte Young theory, then everything would be okay?       Well, that would be a waiver of -       -- whatever sovereignty immunity interest it had, wouldn't it?       Well, Congress could, but if they knew it in this instance when they accepted the money, you wouldn't have a case, would you?       That's a good point.
09-530 +++$+++        Mr. Stormer, what provision of the Constitution are you relying -- I looked at your table of authorities in your brief, and you have cases listed, you have statutes listed; there is not a single citation anywhere in your brief to a provision of the Constitution. What provision of the Constitution are you relying on?       I think it's a very nice thing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive questions.     I also think it's a nice thing that the Government should pay a living wage to its employees, but I don't feel authorized to go around saying how much the Government should pay each of its employees because there is nothing in the Constitution about that, and the question is left to Congress. What do you rely on in the Constitution that enables me to decide how much intrusiveness is too much, rather than leaving that to Congress?       The Fifth Amendment?     Okay. Which says no person shall be deprived of what?       Due process of law.       All right.     That -- that's what I thought.     You're talking substantive due process here.       I mean, I like that, but I just don't see it anywhere in the Constitution.     That's all I'm taking about.       But we can handle those details.     My goodness, it's all right there in the Constitution.     And we can decide what -- what employees have to know what, and what questions you can ask them, and how much privacy is too much privacy, right?       It's a piece of cake.       Excuse me.     I thought -- I thought that your friend said that the badge enables you to get within 10 feet of the shuttle?       Well, do you contradict that?     And if it's so, how can you say that these people are low-risk employees?       Does al-Qaeda know all this stuff?       Does al-Qaeda know this? (Laughter .)       Why do you say a private employer could not ask a question of such detail?     Why could not --       Why could a private employer not -- not do it?       Well, you mean that legislatures take care of these matters?     I find it curious that in order to establish a Federal constitutional right, which turns this area over to this Court, you invoke laws that have been democratically enacted by State legislatures.     I mean, if indeed that's -- that's the criterion, maybe you don't need us.

09-559 +++$+++              So the country was acting unconstitutionally for a whole century before we adopted the Australian secret ballot?              Do you really think that?             That it was unconstitutional --             -- for a whole century not to have a secret ballot?             So you -- you would have no objection to as an-applied challenge to disclosing the names of individuals to a particular cause, where it is demonstrated that the opponents of that cause are violent and will do violence to the people who signed the petition?             So this is just a general challenge to ever, ever disclosing the names of petition signers?             Right.             But -- but you -- you ve rejected that here.     You ve said there s no evidence here that any of the petition -- petition signers were subjected to any harassment.             Of course there isn't, because the names haven't gotten out yet.                 How could you possibly demonstrate before the names get out that petition signers are going to be subjected to harassment?             Or otherwise, don't insist upon evidence that these very petition signers will be harassed.             And you think that would be an acceptable type of evidence?             Well, if you don't think it's acceptable, then -- then -- then you re not making an argument.             Sometimes the public may not trust the Secretary of State.             It -- it may be an issue in which his administration has taken a particularly firm stand, and the public may not trust the job that the Secretary of State does.              Trust but verify -- I like that. (Laughter.)              Isn't that information, at least the names of those people -- isn't it probably public information anyway?

I thought you were -- you were asserting that it was intentionally removed in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing it.       You don't know that.       But it isn't -- it isn't clear from what -- according to what you said earlier, it isn't clear that it was intentionally withheld from the defense.     It might have just been -- you said it was sent to the lab when -- when he came to look for it.       So would training have -- have gone into that detail?     Don't send something to the lab when defense counsel is coming over to look for it. I mean, you know, that -- that's pretty detailed.       Okay, but -- but that --       That's the lab report. That -- that's what Justice --       For all we know, by accident, right?     And the training would -- would probably not have remedied that -- that difficulty.       The defense was told to come over and look for it -- to look at it.     And when he came over to look at it -- for all we know, by accident -- it was -- it had been sent to the lab.

We've never adopted the ABA standards, have we?       That standard seems to me quite silly. (Laughter.)

Yes.           I see.       But -- but I thought you said you could take into account good behavior in that determination?             But that isn't -- that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow the reduction.     It's a factor that --
09-658 +++$+++        Yes, but Judge Reinhardt and the court of appeals did not in fact apply the test of Hill, which you are asserting.     The test is whether he would have gone to trial.     I -- I didn't read the opinion as ever saying that he would have gone to trial. The opinion says he could have gotten a better deal. That's quite a different -- quite a different question, and I -- I'm not prepared to make that the test.       But it's not the test that -- that Hill prescribed.       Mr. Wax, as far as the confession is concerned and its excludability, what effect do you think we ought to give to this passage in the -- in the defendant's agreement to the plea:     "I understand that any admissions, statements, or confessions which I may have made or any evidence obtained by virtue of the search and seizure of my property may well be inadmissible against me in evidence, unless my constitutional rights have been safeguarded.     I understand that if I would like to speak to an attorney concerning my constitutional rights, that the Court will grant me time for that purpose."       Well, wait.     Wait.     This is not the attorney speaking.     I mean, this is what he said.     He said, "I understand that any admissions, statements or confessions which I have made may well be" -- "may well be inadmissible against me in evidence."       Well, boilerplate -- I mean, the man signed it.     How can a prosecutor ever protect himself against the person who signs a plea agreement later -- later coming in and saying:     Oh, my attorney misadvised me. I don't care what your attorney advised you. The plea agreement itself advises you that this stuff may be inadmissible.
09-6822 +++$+++        How?     Would -- would you explain, as concisely as you can, why you think that (g)(2) would be unconstitutional in -- in some limited category of cases, and how that can be avoided by what you call a flexible interpretation?       All right.       Well, but -- I mean, why wouldn't you read that simply to have been overcome by the holding of Booker, that you apply -- that every judge has to apply 3553 factors and decide the ultimate sentence on the basis of those factors?     I mean, isn't that what Booker said?     And why wouldn't you apply that to -- to (2)(A) and (B) as well?
09-737 +++$+++        The Johnson line isn't much of a map, is what the Chief Justice is suggesting.     It's a mess.     It's very hard to sort those things out.     Why -- why should we double the difficulty by -- by bringing it in at the -- at the Rule 50 stage as well?       Why?     All you have to do - any lawyer going in knows he has to make the motion at the close of the evidence.     What -- what's the big deal?       Excuse me.     I -- why do you -- why do you seem to concede that 50(a) only -- only applies to evidentiary stuff?     I mean -       -- the way it reads is, if during a trial by jury, a party has been fully heard and there is no -- no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.     Well, if it's as a matter of law, no amount of evidence would ever allow a -- a jury verdict in that direction.     Surely, that falls within -- within (a) -       -- even though evidence has nothing to do with it.     No matter what the evidence is, this is simply a matter of law.     No jury, no reasonable jury, could find for that party on that issue.     I don't read this as being purely a -- you know, a provision governing whether there is -- there's enough evidence in an area where there is no absolute rule of law.     I think it applies to the absolute rule of law as well.       The point would be that, therefore, you don't have to sort out whether there - there is any factual content to this issue.     You don't have to sort out what's a pure question of law and what is a mixed question of law and fact, which is always very difficult.     What's the big deal?     Make the motion.
09-751 +++$+++        My goodness.     We -- we did have a doctrine of fighting words, and you acknowledge that if somebody said, you know, things such as that to his face, that wouldn't be protected by the First Amendment.       Unprotected.       Is -- is that so?     Do we know that?       Do we know that?     Is it the criterion of the fighting words exception to the First Amendment that there be an actual fight?     Certainly not that.     Is -- is it a requirement that there be a potential for a fight?     I doubt it.       Where -- where do you get the notion that it has -- that there has to be an imminent fight?       Which say what?       The person was too remote? The fight was not -- was not imminent?       And she's a Quaker, too. (Laughter.)       Do you think that everybody --       Excuse me --       Let's talk about subjectively.     You're concerned about -- surely fighting words is -- you know, whether something is a fighting word, that's a very subjective call, isn't it?       You don't think it's subjective?       You think that's solid, absolutely, what's a fighting word; whereas, what is an outrageous statement is -- is very much different from what's a fighting word?     I don't see the difference. Besides which, isn't it the case that in order to recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional injury, you have to substantiate the injury with some physical manifestation, which the plaintiff here had? And, my goodness, for fighting words, you don't even need that.     You can just say, these words angered me to the degree that I would have been inclined to fight.     At least for this tort, you have to have physical manifestations. Why isn't that a very objective standard?       So your point depends --       -- depends upon the proposition that what is outrageous is more subjective than what is fighting words, right?
09-804 +++$+++        What is that provision?       Does it appear anywhere in -- in the briefs?     1024(h), does it appear anywhere in the briefs?       Why not?       But the likely harm -       That's not the likely harm. That's the breach.     That's the offense.       You're saying once you make the offense, you have to cough up what you stated in the -- in the summary.       Well, then it's not contract.       Is it contract or not contract?       Is this governed by ERISA or are these things governed by ERISA?       But we have a statute here which says that it is the plan that governs.     I mean, that -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial difference?       Do they use a likely harm standard?     Is that where the likely harm standard comes from?       They just made it up?       So it can't -- it can't amend the plan, contrary to what we've said.       It's not an amendment?       Well, wait -- wait.     It's part of the plan, but the other part of the plan contradicts this part of it.     And -- and you say it is this part, the SPD, that governs, which means it amends the prior part, right?       Oh, all right, okay.     We'll say it controls.     Does that make you feel better about it?
09-834 +++$+++        Wouldn't any retaliatory action be willful?     I mean, to say it's in retaliation means you are firing this person because of the complaint.       Your case would be a lot easier if you didn't try to have it both ways, to say, number one, it only applies to filing a complaint with the Government.     And number two, you say, it also only applies to written complaints to the Government.     I mean, why don't you -       Why don't you give a break to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with the Government?       Suppose it says we won't necessarily institute a proceeding, but we will regard it as a complaint?       But your easier answer is, "yes, but only with the government."     Why isn't that an easier answer?       Do we owe any deference to the Government's position on this point?       Well, I mean, regardless of whether we do, why -- why don't you think we --we have to give any deference, Chevron -- Chevron deference.
09-837 +++$+++ 
09-846 +++$+++        Your argument assumes that there is available in the district courts injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that is far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear if you had any business being in the district court anyway.     And so in a way we are resolving a very strange question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an abstract question.       Isn't that unrealistic? You don't want an accounting for the sake of having an accounting so that you can put the accounting in your desk.     Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us. You want to get the $1,000,000,000.     If the suits are directed at the same object, and it is fanciful to think there is this separate suit for an accounting.     The object of that suit is the same thing as the object of the suit in the Court of Claims.       Were those accountings available before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed?     Is the jurisdictional basis for that the waiver of sovereign immunity that allows you to demand an accounting from the United States?     Is that just the APA?       So you didn't have a right to that before the APA was passed?       Either in the district court nor in the Court of Claims.     So this is not an unthinkable situation, is it?       It was thought about for a century, anyway.       Well, why have -- you say Congress has specifically recognized it by statute. You're referring to the APA?       But did not provide for a lawsuit against -- against the government.       Well, excuse me, it didn't make it easier.     You -- you had to bring them both in the court of claims, no?     You didn't still have the option of -- of still bringing two different suits, did you?       You had to go to the court of claims.       No, but if they were just making it easier, they -- they would have said, you know, you can do either one.       If you give it that narrow meaning, however, the government says you are contradicting what was the case with regard to the cotton suits.     That, in fact, some of them were asking for funds from this -- money from this common fund, and others were seeking relief against the individuals who had taken the cotton or replanted the cotton.     Those are different claims, as you define "claim," anyway.       That is different from the word "claim."     I mean, if you are hanging the whole thing on the word "claim," you gave me a very plausible alternate definition of "claim."     But your case does not follow that.     Your case hinges on duplicative relief, which is something quite different.     I don't know any definition of "claim" that is synonymous with duplicative relief.
09-868 +++$+++        Do we have any indication in the case law what a reasonable time consists of?       Well, that may be right, but I don't think that's the reason.     I -- I thought we had held that the word "filed" in the petition means filed in a court, not filed with the governor.     It's - it's the word "filed" in -- in the tolling provision that -- that does the work.       So if this was -- if this motion had been filed before judgment, which can happen, before the judgment is final, then there would be no tolling?       So the question -       So the answer is yes.     This motion which can be filed either before or after judgment -- the time is tolled if it's made after the judgment but not if it's made before.       Well -- well, that's not - that's not what the State says, anyway.     The State says, and I think the way 35 reads, it doesn't have to be filed after judgment.       That's right.     It can't be filed any later than that.     But it doesn't say that it can't be filed before judgment.       That's right.       When does -- when does it become final?     When does the -- even at the trial court level, when does it become final?
09-893 +++$+++        Of course.     The question is not whether they are being forced to accept class arbitration; it's whether they are being coerced into abandoning regular arbitration.     That's really the issue.       That's true, as long as those impediments are removed on an -- on an equal footing with all contracts.       Yes, but I -- I find it difficult to regard as -- voiding exculpatory contracts. I mean, yes, contracts which say I'm not liable if - even though I've committed a wrong, that's exculpatory. But the State here says, you have to not only be liable for any faults that the other party to this contract discovers, but the other party of this contract has to be able to benefit from whatever faults anybody else in the world might find and bring -- and bring a class action lawsuit.     I -- that -- that goes well beyond forbidding any exculpatory provisions.
09-9000 +++$+++        To -- to win a Brady claim in habeas, wouldn't you -- you have to show not just that the -- that it was withheld, but that it was, indeed, exculpatory and could have affected the outcome of the trial.     No?       But he doesn't have to make that showing here.     I mean, that's -- that's what he says distinguishes this case from habeas.     In habeas, you would have to show that, indeed, it would justify a different outcome in the trial, whereas here he says I don't have to show that; I just want the evidence.       That's what he is going to do with it.     But he doesn't -- he doesn't say that I need to show that in order to be entitled to -- to the relief I'm asking for, whereas he would have to say that in habeas.       Maybe -- maybe we need -- I mean, we've never had a case like this, and it's conceivable to -- to me that we have to expand what we said in Heck and Preiser.     I'm not sure, however, that what we ought to say is what you propose:     That the test is whether it could be brought in habeas.     You say it could be brought in habeas by claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, but you would lose that -- that habeas. You can bring anything in habeas.     I mean, you can file a habeas petition.     I assume you mean you could possibly win in habeas.     You couldn't win in habeas with this claim because you couldn't show that it would have affected the outcome.     Isn't that so?       What about where its only purpose is to demonstrate -- is to be able to demonstrate the invalidity of a judgment?
09-907 +++$+++        I must say your position is more logical than the position that you read in some of the instructions applicable to the -- to the chart that's referred to in the Bankruptcy Code, but not others.     I mean, it seems to me, if you're going to read in the requirement that have to have made a lease payment, you should also read in the requirement that you're referring to now, which would mean your deduction is limited by the -- by the amount of your lease payment. I don't see why -- is there any reason why one would read in the other one and not read in yours?       Why aren't -- why isn't one of the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum allowances for housing and utilities and transportation, known as the local standards, vary by location, and unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is less?     Why doesn't that apply?       Right.       Right.       It's not applicable.     It's not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much. Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no payment at all.
09-958 +++$+++        That -- that's not --       That's not the theory on which we've said you can't get damages under Ex parte Young.     The theory that prevents damages is the theory of sovereign immunity.     The -- the fiction that you're -- that you're moving against the individual and not against the State simply cannot be maintained when you're taking money out of the State treasury.     That's the basis for it, not -- not what you just described.       You've lost me here.     You -- you say there would be a cause of action under the Supremacy Clause if the agency approves the rates, but your clients don't think the rates are high enough?       Under the --       Well, Federal law is determined by the agency, surely.     So long as the agency is complying with the Administrative Procedure Act, I don't see how you have any --       -- any cause of action under the Supremacy Clause; you may have an APA cause of action.       Federal law is not determined by the agency?       Federal law is not determined by the agency?       Well, then you don't have a Supremacy Clause cause of action.
09-987 +++$+++        But there -- but there is a discrimination, I gather.     The -- the school that seems to get the most money on the list doesn't appear to be a religious school at all.     It's -- it's not even discrimination between religion and nonreligion, if you think that that is invalid, which I don't.     But it doesn't favor religion at all.       Then what's your problem under the Establishment Clause?       You can't -- you can't have a government program that gives out money indiscriminately to certain organizations that, say, provide hospital services, and it would be unconstitutional if that included organizations that were religious organizations, as well as organizations that were not.     That would be unconstitutional?       So you must positively disfavor religion?       Do we know that the schools here do that?     There are some religious schools.     Do we know that these religious schools do not admit people except of a certain religion?       That's a great leap to say that it's government funds, that any money the government doesn't take from me, because it gives me a deduction, is government money.     I mean, that's the first leap you make.       This money has never been in the government's coffers.     The government has declined to take this money.       Well -       They don't owe it to the government if they have made this contribution.     That's the whole point.       They don't owe the tax to the extent that they have given money to one of these institutions.     You -- you say -- you posit at the very beginning that you owe a full amount of tax.     That's just not true.     You don't owe the tax if you've made the $500 contribution.       You owe the tax?       That's the problem; they have to revise their form.       So that it's a deduction before the line.     This is a major lawsuit?       But the government money you claim is at issue here is -- is the money that the contributor to the STO has failed to give to the government when it's the government's money. Now, that decision, of whether to give the money to an STO or not, whether to give it to a religiously affiliated STO or a nonaffiliated one, that is in the hands of a private individual, just as the voucher program was.       There -- there's no religious discrimination in that choice.       Perhaps not, but you have -       You have an intervening parent or contributor.     And it's that person who is making the decision of whether to give it to a religious or nonreligious organization; it isn't the government making that decision.       And that was the same thing in Zelman.       Oh, but that -- that doesn't -- that doesn't get you there.     That doesn't get you there, as Justice Breyer's interrogation indicated.       The same thing is true of charitable deductions.     When you take a charitable deduction, you -- you don't have the money anymore.     You have given it to a charitable organization. Now, you are allowed to give it to a particular religion, a particular church, and there seems to be nothing unconstitutional about that, right?       So what -- what is unconstitutional here about the private -- the private decision to -- to give a benefit to a -- an organization that only supports particular schools and, indeed, only supports people of a particular religion to go to that school?     I don't see any difference.       But churches discriminate on the basis of religion.     When I take my charitable deduction to give it to a particular church, that church discriminates on the basis of religion, but that's okay; isn't it?       So it's how the government puts it, the idea?     So it really is just that line in - in the tax form that you are concerned about, and the only relief you really need is -- is changing the tax form?       I thought you said the opposite earlier.     I thought you said the opposite earlier.       I'm sure you did.       That's the other issue.     We are trying to separate in your argument the issue that some of these organizations are religiously affiliated, from the argument that, moreover, they will only give money to individuals of a particular religion. Now, I understand your argument for the latter, but I must say I don't understand your argument for the former.     Not if you accept these other -
09-993 +++$+++        Well, they're -- they're - they're under the obligation to report to the FDA the facts which establish the grave risk, right?       So the argument here is whether it -- it will be the FDA ultimately that determines whether there was a grave enough risk to modify the -- the label or whether that call will be made by -- by a State court guessing what the FDA would have done, right?       Yeah, but -- but -- no, but -- but surely you have to establish not only that the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but that a label change would have been approved.     Otherwise there's no causation.     Surely -       -- that's part of your case, isn't it?       No, but -- but their - their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, and you don't contest that.     They had to give the warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the warnings must be changed, so -       -- I mean, I don't see how you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to give the warnings that they had to give.       And they could have lobbied the FDA to say, you know, change the warning, but if the FDA said -- suppose the -- suppose they did tell the FDA, please modify the label, and the FDA said no. Would your lawsuit still proceed?       No.       I would say -       All right.     You're drawing a line between the FDA rejecting a warning and the FDA not accepting the warning; is that the line you're drawing?       Just so I understand what you've said, this 3-month turnaround that you mentioned, they are all requests from labeled manufacturers, right?       I thought you said that generic manufacturers don't make any requests.       Oh, okay.       Oh, I see.       Does a generic manufacturer have to be an expert in the field in which it manufactures?       What does -- what does being an expert mean?       In this context, being an expert means being able to produce exactly the drug that has been approved by the FDA, right?     You don't have to be expert in anything else?       What else do they need?       That doesn't make them an expert.     I'm talking about what expertise does -- does the company have to -- to possess.     It surely has to possess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the product that the -- that the -- that has been approved by the FDA.     What other expertise is necessary?       I don't think that'd take any expertise.     You have people who complain, I've taken -- I've taken your pill, and it --     it, you know, it's caused -- this is expertise?     That's not what I normally think of.     Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed, require expertise, conducting tests and knowing what changes will produce what results and so forth; right?       Somebody has been appointed in all those cases to sort of carry the flag, right?       Don't they have a distinct obligation to propose labeling changes when they -- when they think they're necessary?       Make it a long sentence, with a lot of "ands." (Laughter.)       Well, I assume that the patient's physician has the same opportunity.     Anybody could go to the FDA and say this label ought to be changed, right?     So the -- the physician taking care of this plaintiff didn't -- had the opportunity to go to the FDA and didn't.     Is there a cause of action against him?       I'm not talking about what the -- the FDCA regulation.     We're talking about what State law would allow, and State law would allow a suit against the physician because he did not take advantage of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label change.       That would be the -- the prologue -- the prologue to the rule said that, and the rule was never submitted for notice and comment.     Is that what you're relying on, that prologue?       How do you decide whether a generic manufacturer ought to have proposed a -- a labeling change?       This is a generic manufacturer.     He doesn't know anything about -- about science.     He knows how to replicate this pill exactly. That's all -- that's all he really knows. Now, what is the test you're going to impose to -- to a jury to decide whether this generic manufacturer ought to have -- ought to have proposed a labeling change?       Is it -- is it, well, you know, if he had been as well armed scientifically as the original manufacturer of the labeled drug, he should have known or, you know, does this guy who graduated from high school and can replicate a pill, should he have known?     What -- what's the -
09-996 +++$+++        These cases that you cite, before you go any further -- are they cases in which the California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying that 6 years was okay?     Or are they just cases where, without an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to the merits?       What -- what do you mean they were decisions, written opinions or just went to the merits and decided the merits?     Did they say anything about the delay question?       But the other side says that, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may have gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier.       They didn't have to worry about it.       Let's assume that -- that California had just adopted this -- this rule that habeas petitions have to be filed as promptly as circumstances permit.     They've just brand-new adopted it, and you're the lawyer for somebody who says, you know, I think I'm going to wait 5 years. Don't you think that even if there were no California law on the subject, you would know that his habeas claim is going to be denied?       Do you really need case law to tell you that 5 years is not as promptly as circumstances permit when you -- when you have no justification?       Oh, so you can't have a first case?       Oh, okay.       You think reasonable men differ about 5 years?       You may be -- you'd better be careful about what you wish for because I am not sure that the kind of system that's being proposed is going to be better for habeas applicants than the one that California now has.     We really don't know that, do we?
10-10 +++$+++        Did the Petitioner know about Rule 23?     Where had he learned about that?     He didn't have counsel, right?       Okay, before -- before it got up to the -       Mr. Bibas, I have a question about -- about the position of the Government in this case.     The Government agrees with you that you don't need counsel, but says that we ought to reverse the judgment anyway because there were -- because the other aspects of due process which the Government asserts would make it unnecessary to provide counsel did not exist in this case. Did you think, under our ordinary rules, we -- we can do that?       Question presented was just whether counsel was necessary, right?       It's fully within the power of the Government to say why, you know, in general counsel is not necessary because these other procedures are good enough.     But then to come forward and say, moreover, those procedures were not applied in this case and, therefore, you should reverse, that's -- that's a new point, it seems to me, isn't it?       I would think that the rule would be that if -- if South Carolina has not complied with minimum due process procedures, minimum due process procedures are required, not counsel is required.       I don't understand all of this discussion.     The question presented is not what due process procedures are required in these cases.     That is not the question presented.       It is simply whether counsel is necessary.     Isn't that the only matter that we should be discussing?       The Government is not a party here, is it?       It's just an amicus.     So, this expansion of the -- of the question presented from whether counsel was necessary to what are the due process procedures required is all at the suggestion of an amicus; is that right?       Could I ask a question about your mootness point?       You say it's --it's not capable of repetition and yet evading review, because should this happen again, he could get a stay, as he could have gotten in this case. Do you have any case of ours which -- which uses that reasoning and says the fact that in a future case you may be able to get a stay suffices to establish that this is not capable of repetition yet evading review?     It's -- it's a new argument to me.     Is there any case of ours that applies it?       Counsel, I don't understand how we could say that if you do not meet minimum due process procedures, you must meet more than minimum due process procedures.     I mean, once we say that it's enough if you do A, B, and C, but this State has not done A, B, and C, how can we say therefore you must appoint counsel?     All we can say is you must do A, B, and C.     I don't know of any instance where we impose more than the due process minimum because you have failed to comply with the minimum.
10-1001 +++$+++        Is that involved in this case?       Do we have to decide this for this case?       It's another case.     It's --       There seems to be a rational line between collateral attack and attack in the same proceeding.     I don't see anything irrational about that.     Right?       Yes!
10-1016 +++$+++        You're talking about the legislative record here?       Is that a closed record? Is that a closed record, the way a record of a case is?       I just find it a strange expression to talk about "in the record" --       -- when what you're talking about is legislative history.
10-1018 +++$+++        Year-long employment is not employment?     If I accepted a government job for only a year, I'm not a government employee?     I don't understand that.       He's working as an employee.     He's hired for 1 year.     It's a 1-year contract.     Why -- why does that make him not an employee?     Or is it the fact that he's a lawyer?     And all lawyers have a certain independent responsibility. They can't do some things that government superiors might tell them to do, right?     So, are you going to say all lawyers are -- are -- cannot plead qualified immunity?       It makes it even easier then.     I -- I thought the attorney thing would help you, but if he's not even functioning as an attorney, he's functioning as a government investigator.       Okay.       But if they had employed him for a year, exclusive employment, no other clients, you'd say that's a different case?       Okay?     And the deal was you're -- you're going to work for us and nobody else. You have no other clients.       Yes, I understand that. How do you look at them?       Does that come out -- case come out the same way or not?       Everybody takes a position to make money for profit.     How many government employees work for free?       No, he's not.     He's not -- I mean, yes, he may be, I guess.     But assume he's not. He's just a lawyer who's been hired for 364 days to work for nobody but the -- but the government.     And you still say that he has no -- no immunity in what he does.       To investigate for the government.       Two years, though?     Three years?     I'm a lawyer who --       -- enters a contract for life with this -- with this government to investigate. At that point, does he get the immunity?       Still not?       You should say section 1983 didn't exist.     That's your answer --       -- to that one, right?       I don't really know that, but you don't know the opposite, either, do you?       And -- and the rule about malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that applied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but to government lawyers as well, didn't it?       So, if we're going to be historically faithful, we should deny any qualified immunity to government lawyers or expand the government immunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do anything so long as it's not malicious?       Right.       Right.       So, the devil with history, right?       What if I told you that all the lawyers at the Department of Justice are regarded as being employed at will and that all of them can be fired?       Do you think the rest of them don't -- don't have any protection?       Wow.     That's going to be disappointing news for all those attorneys at Justice -- (Laughter.)       You don't want to say that. (Laughter.)       Yes, but if -- if he did the same thing for a private company -- he could do the same thing for a private company, say, you know, you're going to get fired unless you substantiate your story by bringing the stuff out of your house.     That wouldn't be a search -- an unlawful search; right?     It could have happened in a private company.       Yes.       Well, there's very little that is uniquely governmental.     I mean, my goodness, if we denied immunity to -- to all those acts that are not uniquely governmental, there would be very little immunity, I'm afraid.
10-1024 +++$+++       What -- what the Government 22     would say is -- is that -- and they have their own 23     dictionary definitions.    I don't -- I don't think it's 24     accurate to say that Black's Law Dictionary defines 25     "actual damages" the way you would have it defined.    As I recall, their briefing gives some other definitions 2     from an earlier version of Black's or whatever. 3                 But what they say about the commission 4     understanding, which you acknowledge to be contrary to 5     your understanding of actual damages, what they say is 6     that at least shows that it isn't clear what "actual 7     damages" means.    And -- and in their estimation, once 8     you -- once you establish that it isn't clear, then you 9     trigger the -- the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity will not be considered to have any scope except 11     that scope which is clear.      Of course, you're talking 8     about statutes that require that the material have been 9     made public, not that, say, establish a violation if one 10     agency provides the information to another agency?    I 11     mean, as the Government points out, this -- this statute 12     goes far beyond any -- any State statutory or common law 13     protections of privacy.    It's really very picky, picky. 14                 And -- and to say that, you know, whatever 15     emotional harm comes from that is -- is quite different 16     from saying that under State privacy laws emotional 17     distress is compensable.      Has had this for a long 21     time.    Okay.      That -- that's a different 12     point.    And the question went to whether you acknowledge 13     the need to be unambiguous.    Now, what the Government 14     says is, of course, the -- the waiver of sovereign 15     immunity, you would acknowledge, must be unambiguous, 16     but the Government says further, moreover, the scope of 17     the waiver of -- of sovereign immunity must be 18     unambiguous.    Whether you have waived it only with 19     respect to pecuniary damages or also with respect to 20     emotional harm, that also must be unambiguous.    And -- 21     and you deny that second step, don't you?    You think -- 22                 MR. CARDOZO      No, but it -- it does use 9     the term "general damages" and makes very clear that it 10     doesn't think this statute covers general damages.    So, 11     I think -- I think you have to argue that the term 12     "general damages" includes only "presumed" emotional 13     harm and not "proven" emotional harm.      Okay.
10-1042 +++$+++        Yes, well, (a) -- the so-called kickback in (a) is not for services not actually performed.     The referral -- the referral is certainly a service performed to the lender.     There's -- there's nothing -- what should I say -- unethical about getting a fee for a referral.     It's -- it's called a finder's fee. So, you know, under (a) a finder's fee is -- is made unlawful, right?       And under (b), something quite different, and that is giving money to somebody who performs no service at all is made unlawful.     And for that, you don't need an agreement, right?       Is this 100 percent thing -- is this a real problem that Congress was addressing?     Do you know of any 100 percent kickbacks or 100 percent payments to somebody else for services not performed as opposed to just keeping part and giving the rest?       Isn't that enough reason for its not being addressed, that it's not a real problem?       It made the decision that a finder's fee in this area, although in all other areas is perfectly okay, but a finder's fee in this area is a kickback.       When an agency is construing a criminal statute, a statute providing for criminal penalties, do you think the agency is constrained to apply the rule of lenity and to assume that if there is ambiguity, it should be interpreted in favor of the defendant?       But you concede that if we give it Chevron deference, you lose?       No, on -- the case.     If we give either the policy statement or the rule Chevron deference, you lose.     Is that right?       Ah.     You want to talk to that?       We don't give deference to interpretations that are beyond the limits of what the language will bear, do we?       Could you complete your earlier answer?     I was just waiting for your point, and it never came.       Doesn't any agency have interpretive authority regarding the statute it's implementing?       Is there agency that doesn't?       Does it have to be specifically conferred?       Is it at all increased when it's specifically conferred?       We give deference to legal interpretations all the time.       I have no idea.     What -- I'm supposed to psychoanalyze Congress in every Chevron case?       And under -- under (b), there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay -- under (b) there doesn't have to be an agreement to pay the title company for no work.     It's just if it's a -- if it's a refinancing and the title company did the same title search, you know, 2 years ago, it says, heck, I'm not going to do it again, but it still gets the 10 percent, right?       Even though there's no agreement to pay it for no work.       They'd be liable under State law, I assume --       -- for fraud, wouldn't they.       Yes.
10-1062 +++$+++        Well, your order could have read, it could have read -- "Notice is hereby given that violation of or failure to comply with the foregoing Order" -- cap "O" -- "may subject Respondents to, one, civil penalties" of up to 32.5 -- now 37.5 per day. That's how it reads.     It could have read:     Violation of or failure to comply with the Environmental Protection Act may subject Respondents to civil penalties. It's quite specific that it is violation of -- failure to comply with the foregoing order, which includes not letting -- filling in immediately and so forth.     It says what it says.     It's the violation of the order that -- that the additional penalties are attached to.       It could -- it could as a theoretical matter double the penalties.       You're just saying, as a practical matter, it doesn't often do that.       I'm not going to bet my house on that.       What about those provisions of the original order?     I must say I was not edified by the fact that, when litigation was threatened or actually brought, the EPA modified its order:     Oh, you don't have to plant the trees. Does it do this as a matter of practice, issue compliance orders that go well beyond what the -- what the EPA would -- would demand?       That's very nice, when you've received something called a compliance order, which says you'll -- you're subject to penalties of 32.5 for every day of violation.       But it shows the high-handedness of the agency, it seems to me, putting in there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA.       Suppose the Corps of Engineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis for refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a permit; you don't need a permit.       Is that binding on --       -- the Environmental Protection Agency?       Can -- can the EPA issue a warning instead of using this -- this order procedure? Compliance order procedure?       So, they could just -- just dispense with this compliance order and tell the Sacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe you're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you know, pine trees on the lot.     It could do that?       And there would be no review of that.       Can't you usually obtain a declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and you think that there is no basis for it, and you can't -- you're not -- you're not compelled to just stand there and wait for the prosecutor to -- to drop the hammer?     Can't you normally bring a declaratory judgment action saying there's no basis for prosecution?       Well, in -- maybe with an informal warning, but when you have something as formal as this which shows that the agency does intend to prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a declaratory judgment action?
10-1104 +++$+++        The lawyer would say, I can't find a starving case in California; so, you must not have a cause of action. Is that what the lawyer would say?       What do you have besides starving?     What -- what else? (Laughter.)       Well, so, if there is one State that would not have an adequate remedy for any -- any single bad thing that could happen in prison, there's a Bivens action for everybody for everything? Is that what you're saying?       Wow.       I certainly wouldn't want to hold that. (Laughter.)       Who says that the burden is on the other side?     Why isn't the burden on you, if you want to bring a Bivens action, on you, to show that there is not an adequate State remedy?       You're the plaintiff here. You're trying to bring the Federal cause of action.     Our law is clear; if there's an adequate remedy we don't invent one.     Why isn't it your burden to show that there is not an adequate State remedy?       That's known as misquoting.       I don't understand what you're talking about.     Is this a suit against a prisoner who was attacked?       He's not liable unless he's malicious, or what?       The warden.       I see.     And -- and the warden is liable in Maryland, you say, only if he is malicious?       Do you think that the warden of a Maryland prison is aware that if -- if he allows one prisoner to beat up another prisoner, he is only liable for maliciousness and not for deliberate indifference, if indeed there is a difference between the two?     Do you think that -- that he's threading the needle that finely, as far as -- as far as deterrence is concerned?       Not at that level of -- of refinement.     I mean, it seems to me that any warden knows he's subject to State tort law and that State tort law renders him liable for negligence and, indeed, for physical assaults.     Some of your causes of action are intentional torts, not even negligence.     I find it hard to believe that, as far as deterrence is concerned, there's a dime's worth of difference between State law and -- and the Bivens action you're asking for.
10-1121 +++$+++ 
10-114 +++$+++        You want to us decide this case on the basis that it was only -- it was only a 1983 claim for the entire time it was in Federal Court until the -- until the very end, right?       What -- what good does that do?     I mean, is that why we took this case?       What principle of law that's going to help the lower Federal courts would come out of that holding?       Whenever you have nothing but a 1983 case, you can give -- and it's frivolous, you can give attorney's fees right up to the limit of the fees expended, right?       Well, I think nobody doubts that, do they?       Oh, no, but you're saying they were only attributable to a 1983 claim during all of this litigation except the very end.
10-1150 +++$+++       Suppose somebody thinks 11     you're wrong, that the numbers you've come up with are 12     wrong.    And they want to develop better numbers that 13     will -- will help the medical profession.    Your patent 14     excludes them from doing that, right? 15                 MR. BRESS
10-1195 +++$+++       Can --      When there is suit in 19     Federal court, let's say these attorney general suits, 20     what are the suit -- what is the suit governed by?    Is 21     it governed by State law?      Well, I mean, I -- Federal 25     law mirroring State law?      Well, it's the authority to 5     enforce, right?      Civil actions brought under 9     the subsection.      So, you have a different -- 15     a different -- a different law applied if -- and the 16     State law limitations don't apply if it's a suit in 17     Federal court by -- by an attorney general?      I mean, it's so weird.    I 22     can't understand that.      But it's not really, if -- 2     if its existence or non-existence depends upon State 3     law; or at least it depends upon State law, you say, if 4     it's brought in State courts; however, if it's brought 5     in Federal court by the Attorney General, you have a 6     totally different law applying, a Federal law.      Yes, but the difference is 6     that the 1983 cases don't deal with what this deals 7     with, which is displacement of the jurisdiction of Federal courts.    And we are jealous of our jurisdiction, 9     not only in the constitutional cases that you refer to, but in all cases. And I had thought that the general rule that 12     you have to be clear when you take cases out of the 13     Federal courts -- I thought that that applies not just 14     where you're dealing with a constitutional jurisdiction 15     but also where you're dealing with already-conferred 16     statutory jurisdiction.    And why shouldn't I apply that 17     presumption?      It didn't deal with the 3     jurisdiction of Federal courts.    That's what gets our 4     hackles up --      We don't like that. (Laughter.)
10-1211 +++$+++        Well, I suppose you could say that there's a likelihood of quite inequitable enforcement if indeed you adopt a position we're going to pick up all of these people and send them away. That's not going to happen.     It'll -- it'll be hit and miss. And, on the other hand, you can enforce it rigorously and equitably upon everyone if you only forbid reentry to those people who want to come back in and who have to, you know, give their names to Immigration, and you can check on -- on this status. That seems to me a sensible reason.       Well, I -- I don't know. I think it would be prospective and unconstitutional because it's irrational.     I mean, not everything that's unconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything that is unconstitutional is not prospective, it seems to -- or do you think that's so? If it's -- if it is unconstitutional in violation of the ex post facto law, the statute has to be -- has to be prospective.     I'm sorry.     Has to be assumed not to cover that prior conduct.     Is that right?       Okay.     And if it does, it automatically has to be interpreted not to cover that?       By reason of the presumption of expectation --       Yes, yes.       Yes.     Yes.       Even -- even if you had pleaded guilty to spousal abuse?       Yes.
10-1219 +++$+++ 
10-1259 +++$+++        How do you know that?     I paid for my license plate. (Laughter.)       Well, this is ridiculous. Look at -- you give the State permission to put the license plate -- to carry -- to have your car carry the State's license plate.     You do not give anybody permission to have your car carry a tracking device.       And whether it's put directly on the car or directly on something that the car is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any difference.       That doesn't make it a seizure.     That doesn't make it a seizure.     It makes it a search.       I mean, you can say that there's a trespass for the purpose of obtaining information, which makes it a search.     But I don't see how it's a seizure.     A seizure -- you have to bring something within your control.     You have to stop the person or stop the vehicle.     What has been seized when you -- when you slap a tracking device on a car?       Do you have any case involving seizure of data floating in the air as opposed to papers?       I mean, what is it, the scary provision of what article?       Mr. Leckar, your -- all of this discussion -- you're going into it, but the questioning leads you into it -- it seems to me leaps over the difficult part of your case.     The issue before us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police conduct is unreasonable.     The unreasonableness requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not take effect unless there has been a search.     And our cases have said that there's no search when -- when you are in public and where everything that you do is open to -- to the view of people.     That's the hard question in the case, not whether this is unreasonable.     That's not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do anything that's unreasonable.     They can do a lot of stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth Amendment, and the -- the protection against that is the legislature. But you have to establish, if you're going to go with Katz, that there has been an invasion of -- of privacy when all that -- all that this is showing is where the car is going on the public streets, where the police could have had round-the-clock surveillance on this individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for 3 months, and that would not have violated anything, would it?       Why?     Because there's no invasion of privacy.     So, why is this an invasion of privacy?       A hundred times zero equals zero.     If -- if there is no invasion of privacy for 1 day, there's no invasion of privacy for a hundred days. Now, it may be unreasonable police conduct, and we can handle that with laws.     But if there's no invasion of privacy, no matter how many days you do it, there's no invasion of privacy.       So is a tail.     So is a tail when the police surveil -- surveil you for -- for a month.       Excellent.     Yes.     Of course, a legislature can take care of this, whether or not there is an invasion of privacy.     And they can pick 5 days out of the air.     You can't do it for any more than 5 days, or you can't do it to more than -- than 50 people at a time.     They can take care of all of that stuff. We can't do that in a decision under the -- under the Fourth Amendment.       Why isn't this precisely the kind of a problem that you should rely upon legislatures to take care of?       I don't see why it's any of Congress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely intrastate operation.     Congress can control police practices that don't violate the Fourth Amendment throughout the country?     I mean, maybe interstate, interstate beepers and interstate tracking devices, yes, but so long as you track within -- within the State isn't that okay?
10-1261 +++$+++       Gee, but we've -- we've said that, under our recent jurisprudence anyway, we 2     would -- we would treat that as a statute of      You think whenever -- whenever we encounter a -- a statute of limitations that 8     is -- is phrased in jurisdictional term, there can be no 9     tolling?      I don't -- I think you 13     understate the -- the strength of Petitioners' argument 14     in this regard.    It seems to me where you say, you know, 15     3 years unless the plaintiff knows sooner than that, and 16     then you say 2 years unless the plaintiff knows earlier 17     than that, and then you say 2 years -- it seems to me 18     that the implication is 2 years, period.    Whether the 19     plaintiff knows earlier, later, doesn't matter.      Well, but what if those 15     three provisions had been -- you know, followed each 16     other immediately?    You know, 3 years unless, you 17     know -- with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and 18     2 years with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and 19     then a third one just says 2 years.    You think there 20     would be no implication that the 2 years means 2 years, 21     period?      Maybe -- maybe you'd better 16     go -- well, go on.    I think you'd better go to the other 17     point because I want to know whether you differ from the 18     Petitioner on the second point.    As I understand the 19     Petitioner, he does -- he does not think that you reach 20     the same result if indeed the violation had been      Thank you, Mr. Wall. 24     That's a nice note on which to end. Mr. Tilden, we will hear from you. ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY I. TILDEN 2                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT      They need not go elsewhere, 24     but when they have gone elsewhere and have found out -- 25     I mean, in this case, it's -- it was not just that you reasonably should have known; it's you did know.    Isn't 2     -- am I right about that?      One would think, if the 4     16(b) plaintiff has really suffered no injury, it would 5     be all the more likely that Congress would want a 6     statute of repose.      The -- the problem I have 24     with your argument is it's a very strange statute of 25     limitations.    Accepting that it is not a statute of repose, it says, you know, you have 2 years after the -- 2     the transaction that was failed to be reported. 3                 And you want to say what it means is you 4     have 2 years from the time it was reported.    Congress 5     would have said that.    It's so easy to say that.    Two 6     years from the reporting.      But I don't know any other 10     statute of limitations that achieves the result that you 11     want that puts it that way.
10-1265 +++$+++       Mr. Waxman, the State 6     contends that the interest of justice standard is not 7     the right one.    Why do you contend that it is?    It 8     doesn't appear in -- in 3599, even though it did appear 9     in -- in the previous provision that used to cover these 10     cases, which is 3006A(c).    You want to carry it over 11     from 3006A(c) to 3599.    That seems to me a little 12     strange when they seemingly intentionally omitted it. 13                 MR. WAXMAN strange, Justice Scalia, and let me explain at least my 15     own reaction to this.    3599, the mandatory appointment 16     requirement, was cleaved from what is now 3006, the 17     discretionary appointment, where Congress said in the 18     Controlled Substances Act, look, in death cases, at 19     trial and in habeas, we're not -- we don't want to leave 20     it to the court's or the magistrate's discretion whether 21     or not to appoint.    We are appointing. And when it did so -- I mean, it is in 23     essence a -- a progeny -- I mean, it is -- it is a 24     cleaving of what was a discretionary obligation. 25     Congress -- Congress had no need in 3599 to reiterate the language in 3006A(c), which itself is not limited to 2     appointments under 3006A(c). I'm reading from page 95 of the petition 4     appendix.    The statute says -- I'm sorry.    It's page 93. 5     That the interests of justice standard says this -- and 6     I'm -- it's the last sentence on page 93a.    "The United 7     States magistrate judge or the court may, in the interests of justice, substitute one appointed counsel 9     for another at any stage of the proceedings."    It doesn't say "counsel appointed under the discretionary 11     authority of 3006." It, like the rest of subsection (c) of which 13     it is a part, is a general rule for duration and substitution of appointments.    So, even if it were not 15     true that the sentence itself applied a force, it's, I 16     think, only consistent with what Congress's manifest 17     intention in enacting -- what became 3599(e) to permit 18     that when substitution is requested, that motion be 19     adjudicated in light of the interests of justice. 20                 And, indeed, that's what the State told 21     Judge Taylor the standard was in this very case.    I 22     mean, look at it this way, Justice Scalia:    Imagine that 23     a district court -- I realize that the cases will be few 24     and far between, very few and very far between, where at 25     a late stage of the proceedings, the court will interject substitution of counsel over the State's opposition and over the court's understandable desire to 3     serve the public interest in efficiently and fairly 4     adjudicating motions. But in the rare case where the district 6     judge says, gee, I think the public interest -- I think 7     that the interests of justice really would support 8     putting somebody else in here, but I can't because it 9     doesn't fit within one of the three boxes of the tests 10     that the State ex nihilo has announced in its merits 11     brief in this Court -- it's just impossible to imagine 12     that Congress would have wanted a judge to say, gee, 13     this is one of these one in a million cases where the 14     interests of justice really requires it, but I can't do 15     it.
10-1293 +++$+++        Yes, that's right.       Well, that's not really clear.     I mean, if you want us to be really clear, you should ask the FCC to simply outlaw any fleeting use of the "F" word, the "S" word, any -- any shots of any nudity in any movie, buttocks included.     That would give you all of the notice that you need.     Why don't you propose that?     Boy, that's certain as can be.       What you acknowledge to be the vulgarity of cable suggests otherwise, doesn't it?       How many displays -- how many displays of nudity were there that -- that went unsanctioned?       Yes, well, I mean, if there are very few, it's not a very powerful argument.       Me neither. (Laughter.)
10-1320 +++$+++        You didn't finish your answer, did you?     I thought you were going on to some other points.       Is there any suggestion that they couldn't go back up?       Isn't it usually assumed that a jury is not finished until it's finished?       You don't agree --       You don't agree -- I don't think you agree that it was their stated verdict, do you?       General MCDaniel, how -- how probable is it that when the jury is polled, and having voted unanimously when they were back in the jury room, one of the members of the jury changes his mind and votes the other way?     That's not at all probable, is it?     But it happens sometimes, doesn't it?       And when it happens, what's the result?
10-1399 +++$+++        Your --       I'm sorry.       But we're not talking --       -- about how the scheme works.     Grant you that it makes a lot more sense your way, but you -- will you grant that it's not up to us to rewrite the statute?       Okay.       So, what we're talking about is whether "awarded" in that provision can bear the meaning that you want to give it.     Let's assume that Congress passes a -- a new statute providing for tax credits for -- for each child, okay?     My wife gives birth to a child just before Christmas, and I say, oh, goody; I've been awarded $2,000.     I wouldn't say that. That's not a normal use of the language.       I am entitled to it under this statute.     But when the event of having a child occurs, I don't say I've been awarded $2,000.     You might say it analogously.     I mean, you know, oh, hey, I've been awarded $2,000.     But that's analogous.     And statutes are not written by analogy; they're written to say what they say. And I don't know anybody that would use the term "awarded" the way you want it used.     The Chief Justice's example is another one:     Oh, good, I've been awarded damages. You haven't been awarded damages.     You're entitled to them.       Let's go through those.       And you -- you show me how -- I agree with you that they don't mean the entry of an award by the agency, but I don't agree with you that the only -- only reading you can give them is entitlement.       933 --       I'm sorry.     Give me a minute.     Give me a minute.       The language is important, isn't it?       Okay.     What page?       Okay.     Got it.       And the language is?       Right.       Right.       Oh, yes.     Yes.       That's -- that's true.     And what that means is that it can be considered an award if you've gotten it from the employer voluntarily.     That is still an award of compensation. That's all that that last sentence proves.       Oh, yes.     Yes.     I agree he's wrong. (Laughter.)       No, no, no.     I think he's persuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking about, subsection (c), the only meaning left for "award" is an award by the agency, because --       But -- but you have to show me one other provision at least where the only meaning you can give "award" is entitlement to money.       (h)(1)?       "Upward adjustments to" --       -- "compensation to which" --       Right.       What -- what does "awarded compensation at less than the maximum rate" mean?     I'm not sure what that refers to.       Right.       Aren't you entitled to get the maximum?     No?       I got you.       Yes.       You're right.     It doesn't make sense.     It --       Yes, yes.       Yes, well, I -- I agree with that.     You can speak of the statute as awarding something.     But when you use the phrase "newly awarded," you're not referring to the enactment of the statute; you're referring to the time at which the person qualifies under the statute.     And I don't know any usage of that sort, that a person -- well, you know, when my wife has a baby, I've been awarded money. You haven't been awarded money.       Yes, that's what you say. But I don't know -- I don't know any common usage that employs the term --       Give me your example again of "award" used as "entitlement." statute. Limbach.       No, no, no.     Not from the       You -- you gave --       That wasn't -- you gave another example.       No, not a case.       -- which seemed to me pretty good.     But I forgot it.     I'll get --       I'll get it from the transcript.       Yes, but I -- I didn't say in that opinion that the -- the employer in -- in that -- or whoever it was that was entitled under the statute -- was "newly awarded" it.     I agree the statute awards it, but when you say somebody is "newly awarded," you're talking about an event at that time.     And that's --       That's a different usage.
10-1472 +++$+++        Have you ever seen a book, you know, translated from a foreign language, you know, "War and Peace," you know, and you're at the mercy of what we call the translator, and it says on the fly page, you know, "John Smith," comma, "Trans.," period. Does it ever say "John Smith," comma, "Int.," period?       No, it doesn't.     It reflects that judgment only if you're right that "interpreter" means "translator."       I mean, you're begging the question.     You could say that the one should embrace the other.     But whether Congress thought that or not is mostly dependent on the language Congress used, isn't it?       Since it is a law dictionary, presumably it ought to have taken into account the cases you're referring to, many of which use the word in -- in this sense, right?       Garner.       So, if there is no legislative history, there's no legislative history on the other side either, right?     Saying that we -- we mean this to include translation.       So, absent legislative history, I guess we have to rely on the words of the statute, right? (Laughter.)       Is it -- is it clear?     Does anybody contend, does the other side contend, that the use of a viva voce translation outside of court is covered by the meaning of "interpreter" here?     I assume that "interpretation" here meant interpretation in the oral proceeding that is the trial. And you're saying that if we hold against you, interpretation will still include all oral translations outside of the trial.       Oh, at deposition, which I consider part of the -- part of the trial process, but not -- not in the lawyer's office where he asks somebody to sit down and -- and read this document to me.
10-1491 +++$+++        Congress could -- could pass a statute to that effect.       Yes.       The issue is whether this did it or not.
10-1542 +++$+++        Well, can you give any example -- the Government says you can't -- of an instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just status; where the status that the parents have is automatically given to the child or, for that matter, automatically taken away from the child?       But there -- there, you -- what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the place, right?     And that's -- that's an -- that's intent. That's imputing intent.       And the child would not have been lawfully there but for the imputation of lawfulness from the parents.       Why isn't it -- why isn't it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and in their decisions that the prior word was "domicile" and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that the word under the new statute is "residence" and the child's residence is not necessarily the residence of the parent?     That seems to me a perfectly valid reason.       That may well be, but it's a different word.       And the one word demands imputation; the other doesn't.     So, I mean, I don't think you can say there's no -- no rational basis given by the agency.       Excuse me.     Was residence at issue in that case?       Mr. Rothfeld, I'm -- I'm curious, how often -- this dispute here is simply about whether the Attorney General is permitted to cancel removal, right?       How often does -- are applications for cancellation of removal granted?     I mean, is it a common phenomenon, or are we really talking here about just spinning it out longer so that the -- so that the person who will ultimately be deported can stay here that much longer?       You think it's as high as 40 percent?
10-174 +++$+++        Well, I don't think -       I don't think that they have to have in mind State law for preemption, either. If indeed the State law just positively conflicts with a Federal statute, it doesn't matter whether Congress had State law in mind, does it?     I don't know -       But you haven't told us how.     It -- it -- it's certainly not harder to find because for preemption you require congressional intent, whereas here -- whereas for displacement you don't. That's not the -- that's not the difference.     What - what is the difference?       You're -- you're lumping them all together.     Suppose you lump together all the cows in the country.     Would -- would that allow you to sue all those farmers?     I mean, don't you have to do it defendant by defendant?       Cow by cow, or at least farm by farm?       So you can lump everybody together, so you can lump together all the people in the United States -       -- who breathe, I suppose.       All right.     All -- all homes -       -- all homes that -- that emit carbon dioxide in their -- in their heating systems.       The whole country, and you lump them all together, and -       -- you say that, you know, that equals 10 percent or whatever.     Does that give you a basis?       Well, then don't give us a 10 percent figure.       Give us the, you know, the maximum figure for a single one of them.       Implausible -- implausible is the word you're looking for. (Laughter.)       I wish Justice Breyer had made this argument in the EPA case.     I don't think the EPA case - (Laughter.)       What if the EPA comes up with a different number?     Would it -- than the one you achieve in this litigation; would the EPA prevail? Would the EPA's number prevail or your number prevail?       Yes, yes.     I mean you -       And will displace the judgment that has been obtained under Federal law?       Right.     And the court says no?
10-179 +++$+++        Of course, Crowell involved public rights in the -- in the narrow sense, didn't it? It was -- it was a public suit.       And perhaps there should be different standards.     Even if you do not agree with my separate opinion in Granfinanciera that that should be the only category, there may well be different standards for public suits in the narrow sense that were involved in Crowell and public suits which are -- are governed by some totality of the circumstances test, which -       But did all of those court of appeals cases involve Article III claims?     Did they pass upon the Article III contention? If not, it's -- it's our clear law that questions -- jurisdictional questions that aren't raised and discussed are not decided for precedential purposes. How -- how many of those cases grappled with the Article III question?       But -- but not most, I don't think.
10-188 +++$+++        Well -       Give us -- give us your definition.     You say you're not standing by the dictionary definition -       -- that was read.     You're -- what is your definition?     It's not just reports of investigations into fraud.     What else is it?       Do you know any -- any dictionary that gives that definition?     I mean, the advantage of -- of the Petitioners' is they use a -- a dictionary definition.     It may be a very broad one and you don't like it for that reason, but it is the way the word is sometimes used.       I don't know any dictionary that would define the word the way you say it.       Don't we have to say why? Don't we have to say why they are they are that?       And once we have to say why, we're -- we're getting into the need for defining what a report is.       We don't usually just say yes, no; you know, we usually give reasons.       Let's talk about the purpose of the statute.     Surely, that should bear upon how you read the -- what you read the words to mean. I had thought that the purpose was as -- as Petitioner's counsel said, the purpose was to allow people to bring qui tam actions who have their own information and who are not just relying on information that they -- that is not personal to them.     Is that accurate or not?       He only knows that because of the FOIA response.       Because -- because the agency said we don't have any reports for those 5 years. Why isn't that information from the agency a report by the agency that we don't have any documents from those 5 years, and, therefore, your client says they didn't file documents for those 5 years?       But your client would search if they weren't filed, and on the basis of no other information except this FOIA response.       How else does your client know that there were no reports filed for these years, which is part of the -- part of the claim here?       He wasn't there during those years, was he?       You don't understand the circumstance.       I don't -- I don't want to have to play these games every time there's - there's -- there's one of these qui tam actions.     I mean, the advantage of Petitioner's solution is that it -- it's easy -- it's easy to apply.     I don't find yours easy to apply at all.
10-209 +++$+++        What if he turns -- what if he turns it down, Ms. Newman?     He says, no, I can't accept this.     What happens then?     You have a new --       Yeah, the judge.     It goes back to the judge.     We agree with you, and we send it back to the judge.     We reinstate the offer, okay?     He accepts the offer.     It goes to the judge, and the judge says:     No, this is outrageous.     I'm not going to approve this plea bargain. What happens then?       We would have a new trial; is that it?       Okay.     So, if the judge turns it down, then the prior trial is valid; is that right?       He turned it down because --       Wait.     Both can't be perfect.     Either he has another trial, although he's just been found guilty by a jury of 12 with an entirely fair proceeding, or else he doesn't have a new trial. Which is it?       Like what?     What factual variation do you think justifies a categorically different remedy?     I mean, it seems to me some of the remedies are good and some are bad.       What factual -- I mean, give me an example of the different remedies and how a certain fact situation could make one okay and the other not okay.       Right.     And why was that okay there?       Why was that okay there? What -- what factual circumstances made that okay there?       I don't -- it's your suggestion that we set aside a perfectly fair conviction.       This is just a hypothetical. If you're going to set it aside --       -- I think you should put it back in.       And there's no prejudice unless he would have accepted the deal.       Of course, it is.
10-218 +++$+++       For what purpose?    Were 24     they -- were they -- were we answering the question for 25     the same purpose, or were we asking it for purposes of whether Federal regulation could extend to the whole 2     river?    For that purpose, it's easy to say if the whole 3     river is, you know, used for commerce, the Federal Government can regulate even those portions of the river 5     that are nonnavigable, that have -- but that have to be 6     portaged around.    But that's a different question from 7     who -- who owns title to the -- to the bed under the 8     portions that have to be portaged.      But -- but they're closed 10     where they're -- they're impassable for ships anyway. 11     They're closed.    What do you mean, remain open?      The question is, has it 8     held that?    Do you have a case where it would have made 9     a difference?      Well, if this is such an 18     understood and traditional rule, why -- why didn't 19     Montana make its rights known earlier when these private 20     owners bought the land?    Indeed, the State gave them 21     condemnation power to flood adjacent lands so that they 22     could build their dams.      And you say while all this 25     was going on, well, of course, everybody knew that Montana owned this land. And now they come back, what, a hundred 3     years later, and they not only want to get the land 4     back, they want to tax them for their use of it over -- 5     over all these hundred years.      That's extraordinary. 8                 MR. GARRE meandered at statehood to show that they did not convey 16     to private parties. Montana courts have recognized for more than 18     a century that these waters are not navigable. 19     Everybody understood that they were navigable.    The 20     reason why this issue only arises now is because of a 21     1999 decision of the Montana Supreme Court that said 22     that the State -- made clear that the State had a fiduciary obligation to seek compensation for the use of 24     the riverbeds.    So, that -- that then teed up the question of whether the State could actually charge rent for the riverbeds.    The State in this case -- 2                 JUSTICE KAGAN:    And what about other landowners on the riverbeds?    If Montana wins this case, 4     will they be paying rent as well?      I thought you say it 25     doesn't belong to the private individuals.    I thought you said it belongs to the United States if it doesn't 2     belong to the State.      Well, there you are.    And 7     you think the United States is going to keep off these 8     fishermen?      But you think they're 16     wrong, right?      You're willing to concede 11     on behalf of the State that if we find that the State 12     does not have ownership of the bed, the State does not 13     have regulatory jurisdiction for all of these purposes 14     that you're now describing?      Well, you have sovereignty 6     over the land owned, owned by other private persons. 7                 MR. GARRE doctrine, what this Court has said in the Utah case and 10     other cases about the role of States in regulating 11     navigable rivers and owning title to the riverbeds 12     underlying those rivers.
10-224 +++$+++        Well, no.     No.     Provisions of the Act, at least as amended, also require humane treatment of the animals while they're being processed. That has nothing to do with whether the meat is any good.     It has to do with humane treatment of the animals.       Wait.     I don't -- you mean the Federal requirements of humane treatment do not apply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal will not be slaughtered for meat; then the slaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor animal?     That can't be right.       What about the provision that says that they will not be exposed to sharp -- sharp instruments that can injure them?     Does that apply to only those that are going to be sold for meat?       Well, wait, no.     But that Act amends, amends, the Act that does have a pre-emption clause.       And, therefore, it seems to me the pre-emption clause applies to the humane provisions as well.       Just in slaughterhouses.     I mean, to the extent it's incorporated in that Act, it only applies to humane treatment by slaughterhouses, right?       Well, but --       Well, it's an additional requirement.     I don't know why it's conflict pre-emption.     It's express pre-emption.     If indeed the Federal regulations say that these diseases disqualify the animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and California says no, we think additional diseases should disqualify the slaughter and sale, that's an additional requirement.     I don't know how you say that's somehow conflict pre-emption.     It's express pre-emption.       You keep saying "not within the scope."     I don't know what you mean by "not within the scope."     Why is it not within the scope?       Right, and what -- what limits it?     What enables the State to disqualify other diseases that the Federal law does not disqualify?       "No additional requirements" is what the Act says.       Well, it doesn't say that. It says "no additional requirements" with respect to all of the operations, both the operations that pertain to those animals that are later sold as meat and the operations that pertain to those animals that are slaughtered and whose carcasses are burned or disposed of.     How do you get the limitation to only those animals that are -- that are slaughtered for meat?       But we're not talking about conflict pre-emption.     If it said you must and the State says you can't, then there would be conflict pre-emption.     But we're talking about express pre-emption, which says in so many words no additional requirements.     And I don't know how you can get around the fact that this is an additional requirement.       I don't think that's what within the scope means.     The pre-emption provision here in the statute has two provisions.     The first one, which is the one we're talking about, says requirements within the scope of this chapter with respect to premises, facilities, and operations which are in addition to or different than those made under this chapter may not be imposed.     That's the first one.     Okay?     Requirements within the scope with respect to premises, facilities. Now, the second pre-emption provision reads: "marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition to, or different than, those made under this chapter."     Now, I read the difference between those two being, under number two it has to be different from something that has been made; whereas under number one, it just has to be different from anything that could have been made under this chapter. It's within the scope of the chapter.     It's within the Secretary's authority to prescribe under this chapter.     I think that's what Congress meant by the difference between requirements within the scope and, in number two, "in addition to, or different than, those made," and that to my mind is -- is a much more plausible explanation of "within the scope" than -- you know, it's directed to the purpose of -- of the statute. I don't think within the scope has anything to do with the purpose.     It has to do with whether the Secretary is authorized to act in this field under the chapter.       It's within the scope of the Act, because he could act and indeed is -- is told to act to prevent stuff like that.     And that's why it's within the scope of the Act for California to do something in addition to what he has chosen to do. And that's why there's a difference between one and two, requirements within the scope, and marketing, labeling, and packaging requirements in addition to or different from those made.     This one isn't made, but it is within the scope of what the Secretary could make.     And, therefore, California should butt out.       Suppose I agree with you on that but don't agree with you -- or least I'm dubitante on that and -- and disagree with you on the rest.     What do I do?
10-235 +++$+++        Of course, the other side says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the language of our cases seems to support that, "in whole or in part" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover, and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence standard.       Why doesn't "in whole or in part" apply to the elimination of contributory negligence?     Isn't that an adequate explanation for the language?       That's what but-for cause means.     Tell me about the snake.     Is the snake covered?       Why not?       Once you abandon a proximate cause requirement, however you want to define that, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the lightning on 42nd Street.       Sure it did.     The train wouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have gotten off, he wouldn't have been bitten by the snake. If the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over the speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been on 42nd Street when the lightning struck.     I mean, how can you say it didn't play a part?     Of course it played a part.       Is that correct?       That negligence didn't play a part?       But for the negligence, the train would not have stopped.     How can you say the negligence didn't play a part?     Had the train not stopped, he wouldn't have been walking along and been bitten by the snake.       I mean do words mean anything?     How can you possibly say that negligence didn't play a part?     It obviously did.     It seems to me you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate cause.     Nobody in his right mind could argue for the nonexistence of proximate cause.     You are arguing for some different -- different definition of proximate cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr. Rothfeld proposed.       And you don't assert that that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of using a wide-body train?       Well, you -- you don't -       You say it doesn't have to be foreseeable.       Oh, so you -- you conceded that it ought to be foreseeable.       I'm trying to see what your case is because I can't believe you don't believe in proximate cause.     I just think you're -- you're giving a different definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out what your definition of it is.       Do it.     I'm still waiting to hear your instruction, which is supposedly something other than "but for."     Is it just "but for"?       With -- what are the words? Give me the words.       You don't think that's "but for"?       I don't care whether I think.     We've got words here.     What do those words mean?       Negligence is a given; the negligence is not what I'm asking about.     I'm asking about causality, and what you have just read is "but for" cause.       If the other side doesn't insist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that one.       Well, this jury found it, though.     What -- what would you tell the jury?       This jury found it unclear and asks you.     What would you say?       You think that eliminates but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a part, no matter how small, in the injury?     You think that eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?       It sounds like foreseeability you're talking.       I thought you said no foreseeability?       Do you want to go back or forth?     Which do you want? (Laughter.)       That sounds like a good definition of foreseeable, doesn't it?     It's natural and probable.       Could something be natural and probable and not foreseeable?
10-238 +++$+++        May I ask how it -- how it combats corruption unless it suppresses large contributions -       -- by certain entities?     I mean, I can understand you say, well, it will stop big donors from giving $10 million to somebody's campaign and having that person in his pocket.     But that -- that donor is still going to have that -- that senator or whoever it is just as much indebted to him if he gives $10 million, regardless of whether everybody else gets $10 million as well. How does it -- how does it combat corruption unless -- unless the other side is correct that its whole purpose is to suppress the contribution of $10 million, to make it unworthwhile for anybody to give $10 million?       I don't know how you can say that there's no evidence that it's been deterred. Is something true just because you say it?     There are in the briefs statistical evidence of how much the population of Arizona has increased and how much less since the enactment of this law the total expenditures have increased. There was testimony in the, in the district court from individuals who said that they withheld their contributions because of this.     It's -- it's obvious statistically also that many of the expenditures were made late in the game, where perhaps they were not as effective, in order to be unable to trigger the matching funds in time for the opposing candidate to do anything about it.     I do not understand how you can say that there is no evidence.     I mean, maybe you might say I do not find the evidence persuasive, but don't tell me there's no evidence.       Ah.       Rhode Island -       -- has the same expenditures as New York State?       You don't expect the two to have any relationship?       Mr. Jay -- Mr. Jay, do you agree with the -- the assertion of Mr. Phillips that this does not favor incumbents? I would have thought that if I'm an incumbent with name recognition, I would love to be able to not raise any money and just -- just take the public funding, knowing that if worse comes to worse and I have an opponent who does have a lot of independent expenditures for him, I'll be able to get that money free from the State.     It seems to me it's very much pro-incumbent rather than anti-incumbent.       Which -- which one should expect campaign finance restrictions to be.       Your answer -- your answer depends upon whether you believe that this scheme will keep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the expenditures.     And if you believe that it will deter people from making contributions, it will keep the expenditures down.       But anything that, anything that makes it more attractive to take the public financing is okay?       I mean, what if -- what if the State of Arizona says we're not going to give - just give money to the other candidates; we're going to send out officers of Arizona to argue on behalf of these other candidates?     That would be clearly banned, right?       And would you come in and say, well, it's perfectly okay because its purpose is to make public funding attractive to candidates?     The mere fact that it makes it more attractive does not answer the question whether it's constitutional.
10-277 +++$+++        I don't -- I'm getting whipsawed here.     On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is a -- a strong corporate culture that guides all of this.     Well, which is it?     It's either the individual supervisors are left on their own, or else there is a strong corporate culture that tells them what to do.       Right.       So, there's no discretion; is that what you're saying?       If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion.       What do you know about - about the unchallenged fact that the central company had a policy, an announced policy, against sex discrimination, so that it wasn't totally subjective at the managerial level?     It was, you make these hiring decisions, but you do not make them on the basis of sex. Wasn't that the central policy of the company?       Now, how was -- how was that established?       And that causes them intentionally to discriminate on the basis of sex?       That causes -- how could that possibly cause them to intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex?       That -- that's just an assessment of why the percentage is different.     They differ not only at Wal-Mart, but at -- throughout the industry.     To say that that's the explanation is not to tell your people:     Don't promote women.       If you have an aggressive woman, promote her.       Have you sufficiently shown -- despite the fact of an explicit written central policy of no discrimination against women, do you think you've adequately shown that that policy is a fraud, and that what's really going on is that there is a central -- a central policy that promotes discrimination against women?     Do you really think -       Can I just say something here?     Doesn't your class include both those women who were underpaid and both -- and those women who weren't underpaid?       Doesn't your class include both?       Is that commonality?       What -- what -- what - what's -- what's your answer assumes is if there is a disparity between the advancement of women and the advancement of men, it can only be attributed to sex discrimination -       Well, otherwise, how could you say that all -- all of the companies are -- are - are presumptively engaging in sex discrimination?       See, I wasn't talking about this case.     I was talking about your answer to Justice Alito -       -- which said that, you know, it may well be that every industry in the United States is guilty of sex discrimination -       -- unless there -- you know, there -- there's equality of promotion for men and women.       This -- this takes evidence, to establish that -- that it's more reliable to have a hearing with evidence on the particular promotion or dismissal of the individual, that that is more reliable than using -- I don't care how admirable a statistical guess you make; I mean is that really a question?       We must have a pretty bad judicial system then.       We should use that in jury trials, too, for really old cases.     We should just put a statistical model before the jury and say, you know, this stuff is too old; so, we'll -       -- we'll do it on the basis of -- is this really due process?       In fact it's more than half the class that's gone, isn't it?       But nobody's leaving yet.
10-290 +++$+++        Mr. Waxman.       Yes, I would like that notion of active acquiescence.       It's like passive activity, right?       Of course the instruction that you've proposed to the jury, like your adversary's proposition, would require determining what it was that the Patent Office considered.     So you -- you haven't avoided the -- the -- the problem of litigating an -- an issue that -- that would better be avoided.       You have to do it for your instruction just as -- as he will have to do it for his.       Yes, but your -- but your instruction requires that, too.     You're inviting the parties to litigate that issue so that the jury can be instructed.     If you -- if you find that it wasn't considered, you can give it -       Finish your sentence.       Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you now.
10-313 +++$+++        The Sixth Circuit?       What happened to the unbundling rule?       Why was the unbundling rule abandoned?       It's not a bottleneck?       Which is (c)(3).       Excuse me.     That's your point, I thought.     I thought it is precisely your point that it is (c)(3) rather than (c)(2).       Excuse me.     I -- I thought it was conceded that -- that none of this is -- is necessary under (c)(3).     I thought that's what the Eighth Circuit said and which is why they eliminated the unbundling obligation under (c)(3).       So, it is accepted by both sides, I think, that this is not necessary.       Do you agree that it has to be needed to interconnect?       The whole problem here is it doesn't have to be needed to interconnect.       It has to be needed under (c)(3), but under (c)(2), it's -- it's up to the -- to the new company to say I want to interconnect here; and -- and the incumbent cannot say, oh, no, you -- you don't have interconnect here; you can interconnect somewhere else.       Like orange wires and such? (Laughter.)       In black?       Well, it used to say the other.     You -- you contend it used to say the other, and it has never, by proper means, gainsaid its prior position.       I thought they said, moreover, that they were not amending (c)(2), specifically.       The Eighth Circuit's decision would have been unnecessary and the revision of the rule?       Maybe the commission didn't like the Eighth Circuit's decision.       It doesn't say it that happily.     It really doesn't.       Well, okay.
10-382 +++$+++        Has it ever been applied, to your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case that the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the trust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where the trust owned the papers that consisted of the attorney's advice?     Is there any case where those two conditions or either one of them did not exist where the -- the trust was required to turn over the attorney's advice?       Yes, but, see, that's the argument of the government, that the exception, the trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled to get it.       But you don't have a single case?       No.     Why can't the trustee say:     I'm going to hire my own lawyer?     I'm not going to pay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my lawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my interests?     Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice?       The trustee cannot hire his own lawyer, you're saying.     So long as he's a trustee, he cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to manage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability. He just can't do it, right?     Trustees can't -       Again, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction. What I ask from -- for from the attorney is advice as to how I can manage the trust so as to avoid liability.     I mean, the -- the two are connected.     You can't separate out advice as to how to manage, how to manage the trust from advice as to how to avoid liability.     In the -- in the context of asking, of a trustee's asking advice, the two are the same.       Did it do -- did it do on that basis, retrospective versus prospective?       We're not talking here about competing interests.     I mean, the example you give of -- of the life beneficiary and the remainderman, those are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict.       We're talking here about an interest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is supposed to do, with respect to the person who is the beneficiary of the trust.     That -- that's a totally different situation.       And ordinarily if there is that kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal conflict, he has to step down as trustee.     You can't continue to be trustee when you -- your own financial interests, for example, are against the financial interests of the beneficiary; right?       That's what the government asserts:     I have other duties as government besides my duties to the -- to these Indians.       And sometimes those duties conflict with my duties to the Indians.
10-444 +++$+++        Why?     Why is it unfair for the law to apply to this individual the punishment he deserved for the crime that he committed?     I mean, the object of the system is to put -- is to punish people who commit crimes in a certain degree. And here he admitted he did the crime, and he got the degree of punishment that the law provides. What could be more fair than that?       Ex ante, I suppose you could say that.     But when you look at it later, it's clear that that would have been unfair.     In fact, this individual was perfectly willing to admit that he had been guilty of more than what the prosecutor had offered.       That's true, and he did that when he entered the plea of guilty.     You -- you do not contest he was well advised when he entered that plea that it was knowledgeable and he admitted that that's what he had done and was willing to accept the degree of punishment prescribed by law.       Doesn't -- doesn't the rule that the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the prosecutor -- indeed, even after it has been accepted -- doesn't that well enough establish that there is no right to profit from that plea offer, that there is no constitutional right he's been deprived of, given that the prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it?       I -- I had hoped you were making some argument other than the knowing argument, because as prior discussion has shown, even if he had known, it would have made no difference to whether he accepted the later plea. Suppose he had been told, "oh, by the way, there was an earlier plea.     It's too late to accept it now.     Do you want to take this plea?"     He says, "well, oh, I'd like the earlier."     "I'm sorry, the earlier plea is gone.     Do you want to take this plea or not?"     He would have taken it. What does the knowledge of the earlier lapsed plea have to do with whether his guilty plea is knowing and voluntary?     It doesn't seem to me to have anything to do with that.     So, I --       I thought you had some other argument that was somehow a right to profit from the earlier offer.     And I find it hard to see that right, given that the prosecutor can withdraw the offer and, indeed, even withdraw it after it's accepted.       And you would also --       But if that's ineffective assistance of counsel, surely it is ineffective assistance of counsel to advise him to turn down an offer that he should have snapped up.     Isn't that ineffective assistance as well?     If it's absolutely clear that this was a great deal, and the lawyer said, nah, you shouldn't take it -- is that ineffective assistance or not?       I gave you the circumstances.     It's clearly a super deal.     Any good lawyer would have told him to take it.       And this lawyer says don't take it. Is that ineffective assistance?       It would not be?       No, it would be ineffective assistance, and the question would be prejudice.     Is that it?       Well, give me a yes -- a yes or no to the question whether, if every reasonable lawyer would have told him to snap up this offer, but his counsel tells him, no, turn it down -- yes or no, is that ineffective assistance?       Then we're in the soup. Then we're in the soup because every one of these pleas is subject to the contention that, oh, there was an earlier plea, or I should have -- I should have taken it but -- I mean -- and I suppose that if he goes to trial, then you would also say that trial should not have occurred because it was the ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to turn down the plea, and, therefore, we're going to -- right -- retry it and set aside the trial?       Yes.       Yes, but at the time, that offer could have been withdrawn by the prosecutor.     And you're saying now it can't be withdrawn.     So, you're really not putting him back in the situation he was in.       I think that's right.       And that's one of the things that causes us to be suspicious of whether there's a constitutional violation --       -- because there really isn't any perfect remedy.       In some cases, not even a close to perfect remedy.       I'm not sure I understand the difference between an open plea and a plea agreement.     He just comes to the judge and says I'm willing to plead to this without the prosecution having offered it?       Okay.       Well, he could still --       He could still --       But you're --
10-507 +++$+++        The trouble with that is that's not what it says.     It says "as a result of operations."       And I don't -- you know, I would think he doesn't even have to be an employee, does he?       What is the backup position that's so much better here?     What is it? (Laughter.)       Yes, but --but Mr. Clement says that -- and we can argue about whether the language does it or not, but the system he comes up with, he says, creates a very sensible division.     You're either under the Longshore Act or you're under this Act.     And -- whereas, in your situation, you can be under both, can't you?       Well, why does that make any sense?       Which one prevails when they both apply?     Are there any differences between the two?       When you're covered by both the Longshore Act and State workmens' comp, can you proceed under either one?       You can't get --       But you think you can proceed under the State law if you choose.       I don't think that's an anomaly.     I mean, you know, if it's a floating platform, it's a vessel.     The difference between a vessel and a dock.     Is it an anomaly that you're covered under the Longshore Act if you're injured on a dock, which is fixed, but you are not -- you're covered under the Jones Act instead if you're on a vessel, which is not fixed?       That doesn't seem to me like an anomaly at all.       How many floating platforms are there, anyway?     And they're covered by the Jones Act? vessels.     They should be; they're       You're -- you are not proposing to eliminate that anomaly?       You're saying wherever you are injured, so long as you're on a platform, you're covered.     I don't think so.       So, you still have an anomaly.       Sometimes it will be covered; sometimes it won't be covered.       So, if you work only 20 percent of your time for this -- this drilling company on -- on the -- on the platform, but it so happens that you are injured on the platform, you know, a bolt comes off and strikes you, you're not covered?       Well, then -- then you're not applying the -- the employment test.     I mean, you either are or you are not.       Heads, I win; tails, you lose, right?     We -- we have a situs-of-the-injury test when you have less than your -- a majority of your work on the platform, but we don't have a situs test when the majority is on the platform.  this statute? I would submit that the How do you get that out of       Was it the Longshore Act? I thought -- I thought it was the Jones Act that they were covered in the helicopter.       I assume that the Act would also apply under your analysis to a -- an independent contractor, a trucker, who carries this heavy -- this heavy steel to the place where this worker worked on it, right?       Well --       -- but he would not have been carrying the steel had it not been for the -- for the operations on the shelf.       I see.     I see.       He would be covered if -- if -- he were employed by the -- by the firm that operates the platform, right?       Well -- it's just the guy that drives the truck that takes the steel to the place where your client worked on it.
10-5258 +++$+++        I'm not sure it's so hard. I -- I could find my way clear to saying that if it has been retroactively made a -- a -- a lesser offense, that that would qualify under -- under the statute.     I don't know why you insist that his actual conviction be -- be altered.
10-5400 +++$+++        I think you'd say it was wrong for the district court to do that.       But whether it can be established on appeal that it was wrong is another matter.       I don't understand what you're saying.     It -- it seems to me what the statute requires is that he consider rehabilitation in imposing the sentence.     Right?       Not in imposing imprisonment.       So he can consider rehabilitation in deciding what this person will be required to do in -- in a probated term, but not in how long he's going to stay in prison before he gets probation.       Well, that wouldn't affect the length of the sentence.     Are you talking about, say, can the judge prescribe that he be incarcerated in a particular facility?       I don't know why you consider that that solves your case, that that makes everything okay.     She refused it.     She would not have been able to refuse it had it been made a condition of her supervised release.     You either take the program or you go back to jail.     I mean, that's -- why is that an insignificant difference? The fact is the judge has no control over whether this person gets the rehabilitation that was supposedly the purpose of the -- of the extended prison term.       It makes no sense.       You're -- you're not responding to my point.     You're -- you're -- you're making a different point.     I'm saying that it's -- it - it -- it does not help your case that the reason she did not get the rehabilitative treatment that this judge wanted her to get was that she simply refused it.     Why does that help your case?     She couldn't have refused it if, as the other side says, had to be the case, he had imposed this rehabilitative measure as a portion of supervised release.     Then she would have had to take it.       You haven't read the -- the crucial provision of the statute.     Yes, you read the - the section entitled imposition of a sentence, but there is another provision in the statute which says imposition of a sentence of imprisonment.     You can indeed consider those factors in imposing the sentence, which includes probation, supervised release and any other matters.     But what -- what 3582(a) says is that the court in determining whether to impose a -- whether to impose a term of imprisonment as opposed to just parole or -- or supervised release, and if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed and determining the length of term shall consider the factors set forth in, that you mentioned in 3553(a) to the extent they are recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation. You have to reconcile the two sections.     And the way to reconcile them is to say that the former applies to sentencing in general but when you're dealing with the length of a sentence of imprisonment or whether there should be any imprisonment at all, you cannot consider rehabilitation.       I don't know any other way to read it.       I -- I don't know what else recognizing that factor would consist of, except you won't use that factor in deciding imprisonment or length of term of imprisonment.       Is that all it means?       But the judge only has the power to impose imprisonment.     He does not have the empower to impose anything else during the imprisonment. I mean, what you're saying might make sense if indeed he could prescribe some treatment during imprisonment, but he can't.     There are prisons -- and why can't he, by the way?     Why has he been prevented from doing that, although he's allowed to do it during supervised release?     Does that make any sense, if indeed, as you say, he can take that into account in imprisonment?       If -- if it is as you say, why -- why did Congress leave it up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide whether this person can enter into a rehabilitation program, and not allow the judge to prescribe that the person will enter into it? Why?     What -- what possible sense could that make?       Judges can prescribe it?       Well, that's a substantive change, they can't prescribe, right?       I don't understand what you're saying.     Was it not a change that the judge could not prescribe a certain program for the prisoner?       It was a change?       Why?     Why would they have that change if the statute reads the way you say?     What sense does it make to still allow the judge to take this into account, but affirmatively deprive him of the power to do what he wanted to do?
10-5443 +++$+++        Why do you -- why do you need that?     I mean, we're always talking here about - about murders of a witness, right?       So you're always talking about a murder that was intended to remove somebody who could incriminate the killer -       -- for some other crime. Why isn't it enough to say you killed that person to prevent the disclosure of the crime, and if the crime was a Federal crime, the disclosure you were preventing was a disclosure to a Federal Court or to a Federal police officer? Why -- why do you have to create a -- a reasonable likelihood that this person, this particular person, would have gone to a Federal officer rather than a State officer?     Isn't it enough to kill the person to prevent disclosure of the crime that the crime was a Federal crime?     Why isn't that the test?       Oh, the government could more than live with it.     The government could wallow in it.       No, but the statute reads it out of the statute.     It says in (g) that you don't - the intent element does -- does not require that you know it's a Federal officer or that you know it's a Federal judicial proceeding.       Why isn't it enough that you -- you kill somebody to prevent the disclosure of a crime that's a Federal crime?       Isn't it rather strange, trials?     It's such a weird issue to submit to the jury in a criminal trial, you know, whether this witness who was -- whether there's a reasonable likelihood that this person who was killed would have gone to a Federal law enforcement authority rather than the State law enforcement authority?       Miss Harrington, we - we've gotten along for over 200 years without this particular Federal law, and I, therefore, am not inclined to give it a -- a sweeping broad interpretation, and I think it's so weird to submit to the jury, you know, how likely is it that this dead person would have gone to a Federal law enforcement officer rather than a State law enforcement officer. Why isn't an entirely satisfactory reading of this statute the following, that if you -- if, indeed, you have in mind specifically the FBI or a Federal proceeding, you're done?     If, however, you don't have in mind specifically a Federal proceeding, but you have in mind a particular proceeding, which is a Federal proceeding, or a particular officer who is a Federal officer, then you're done, but anything else isn't covered? So the intent has to be the intent to stop a particular proceeding or -- or to stop the person going to a particular officer.     If that proceeding is Federal or if the officer is Federal, you have the -- but otherwise, the laws that we've lived under for 210 years will continue to apply, and -- and -- and this new Federal statute will not apply.       I suspect that what this mainly addressed is -- is killing of witnesses, which has become very common in some jurisdictions, witnesses in criminal trials, and you know darn well what trial is involved.     It's a trial that's already underway, and if it's a Federal trial and you kill the witness, you're - you're liable under this statute. What -- what is covered beyond that is if - if you know that the information is going to be given to a Federal officer, then they have you also, but I don't know why we should read the statute any more broadly than that and -- and have these weird questions submitted to the jury how likely was it that this - this dead person would have gone to a Federal officer rather than a State officer and -- and inquire into the question that Justice Alito asked, you know, how is there a friendly relationship between State and local officials so that the State official would -- I don't want to get into that.     I don't think the juries do.       Understand this, you mean it would have been okay if he went to a Lithuanian movie? (Laughter.)       Would -- would you not acknowledge that the statute is vague enough that the intent which it requires could be either the intent to prevent testimony from being given to a particular Federal proceeding or to a particular Federal officer or the specific intent to withhold it from a proceeding or an officer who happens to be or which happens to be Federal, but which the defendant is not aware is Federal?     It could bear that meaning, couldn't it?       Oh, I acknowledge that, but a particular judge or -- or the conduct of a Federal proceeding, it could -- it could require specific intent of a proceeding or a judge or an officer which happens to be a Federal officer.       It's unfair for him to ask you what my -- what my hypothetical was.     I think the answer is yes.
10-545 +++$+++        I do not think a treaty can expand the powers of the Federal Government.     I mean, this is either okay under the copyright clause or it isn't.     Now --       -- it would be nice to know the reason for it, but you would still have to establish that it's within the power of the Federal Government --       Okay.
10-553 +++$+++        That's extraordinary.       That's extraordinary.       We're talking here about the Free Exercise Clause and about the Establishment Clause, and you say they have no special application to --       There's nothing in the Constitution that explicitly prohibits the government from mucking around in a labor organization.     Now, yes, you -- you can by an extension of First Amendment rights derive such a -- but there, black on white in the text of the Constitution are special protections for religion.     And you say that makes no difference?       I think that the balancing of interests is different, according to the Petitioner, when one of the interests is religion.     And you're just denying that.     You say:     We balance religion the way we balance labor organizations.       That's certainly not what the Petitioner is saying.       Even with respect to their religion classes and their theology classes?     It's extraordinary.       Just because -- just because you have to comply with State education requirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick to -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to be -- has to be subject to State control?       I don't think they merge at all.     Smith didn't involve employment by a church.     It had nothing to do with who the church could employ.     I don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this. I would -- I didn't understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question.     You -- you say that there were different institutional values or government values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran minister.     Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is removed from his duties because he married, okay? And -- and he claims:     No, that's not the real reason; the real reason is because I threatened to sue the church.     Okay?     So, that reason is just pretextual. Would you -- would you allow the government to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was pretextual?       Why?       Why is that any different from the Lutheran minister?       I think that's saying nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests, that you think the one is more -- is more important to -- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans.       It's only a bad approach if we adopt your test.     Why isn't it a perfectly reasonable test whether the person -- although the person may have a lot of secular duties, whether the person has substantial religious responsibilities?       But it's not paramount. Would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest example.     Does that get into the courts?       Why not?       But he can sue for money, right?       Not reinstated.     He can sue for money.     He can sue for, you know, the loss of --       Gee whiz.     Do -- do Lutheran schools and Catholic parochial schools share public funds the same way public schools do?       You bet you they don't.       What is this argument you're making?     I don't understand.       Don't tell me that fair is fair, that now, you know --       -- we're just like everybody else.     That's not true.
10-568 +++$+++        So does this.       Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a legislator?     Is -- is that speech?     Because judges are subject to ethical rules which -- which prohibit their participating if there would be, quote, "an appearance of impropriety."     If there's anything vaguer than that I can't imagine what it might be.     Can I get out of all that stuff? (Laughter.)       Are you answering my question?     I want to know whether I can get out of this appearance of impropriety stuff.       Why?       What does that have to do with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of its prohibitions against vagueness?       That's too bad, because I would have been much more attracted to your position. (Laughter.)       That's rather exaggerated. I mean, you have to worry he's going to buy a casino or -- or something like that?     I mean -       If that's what it means, you would think the legislature would change it, wouldn't you?       I mean, it doesn't just hurt Mr. Carrigan.     That -- you know, that -- that would be something every legislator would -- would worry about and say, oh, boy, we've got to change this.       So why don't we let them change it?
10-577 +++$+++        What about just not filing a return?       Well, I -- I'm confused by the $10,000 requirement.     Does that have to be an element of the offense?       Just a consequence of the -- of the fraud or deceit, right?       They still wouldn't -- no. Why?     They still wouldn't be tax offenses.       I mean, you use the mail to avoid -- still, what you're being prosecuted for is use of the mail to defraud.       Well, he put it -- he put it wrong.     He should have said -- just tax statutes are covered.       Then -- then you wouldn't have to bifurcate, right?       Well, it's not just that. It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the victim or victims.     And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to the government has to exceed 10,000.     I mean, in one case, it's the loss to the victim or victims.     Why -- why did it use parallel language?     Why -- or why did it say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i) involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section 7201 of Title 26?     I mean, if -- if you read it, it seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with revenue loss to the government. And I find it hard to regard the government as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the truth.
10-6 +++$+++        Wait.     Before you go - before you go further, what if you do that, okay?     And you get an opinion from a lawyer, as they did here, saying you're not violating any copyright or any -- any patent?       Okay.     You have to tell the searcher that you copied.       That is part of your test, right?       Well, one of the -- one of the briefs -- one of the amicus briefs in this case points out that that argument is a lot less plausible in copyright than it is in -- in patents.     It is very easy to find out whether you're infringing a copyright.     It is very difficult to find out whether you're infringing a patent, especially in the modern age of warehouse patents.     I am not sure that we -- that we want to use the same test for copyrights that we use for -- for patents.       Well, that's fine.     I am just -- I am just expressing reservations about your suggestion that we simply take Grokster wholesale and apply it to this situation.       He is not interested in what happened here.     I mean, we are still talking about a general test.
10-63 +++$+++        What does the return mean when you get -- get a notice returned?     It just said no longer at Sullivan & Cromwell, is what the two of them said, right?       Does that necessarily mean that they've abandoned the case?     It just means you got the wrong address, doesn't it?       Isn't that the only thing it means for sure, these lawyers are no longer here at Sullivan & Cromwell?       I don't know how that would be an indication of abandonment.     Can't you switch a law firm and keep the client?       Of course, he didn't have to send the letter.     That letter had no legal effect, did it?       I mean, it was just the way, your time has expired.     I mean, this is not -- what could the lawyer do about it?       It wasn't a required notice that he had to give to the lawyer or to anybody else.       So he just made this extraneous, volunteered statement to Maples instead of to his lawyer.     I don't -- I don't know what that proves.       Well, the argument is that on the record or not is determinative for the out-of- town counsel, but it is not determinative for the in-town counsel.     The fact that he is counsel of record doesn't count, but the fact that those two are does count.     And only when you combine those two does the man have no counsel.     Right?       Well, as then the clerk has to believe that it's an important letter.     Right?     It's not important enough to be required by the Federal rules.     How important is it?       Well, even --       Even if you assume that he had figured it out, that -- you would have to impute his knowledge to the clerk of court to -- to find the -- the fault on the part of the State that's alleged here.       Did he tell the clerk of court that he was only going to send it to Maples?       Mr. Neiman, am I correct that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is represented by more than one attorney, the notice does not have to go to all of them?       It can only go to one, right?       So, as far as local counsel knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this thing, right?       If we find --       If we find that these lawyers did abandon their client, will there be some sanction imposed upon them by the bar?     I often wonder, just as when we find that there's been inadequate assistance of counsel in a capital case, does -- does anything happen to the counsel who have been inadequate in a capital case?       Have you ever heard of anything happening to them?     Other than they're getting another capital case? (Laughter.)
10-637 +++$+++ 
10-6549 +++$+++        Post- what?       Well, we had a case involving the meaning of "modify," and it doesn't - doesn't mean "repeal."     So, he presumably couldn't suspend the whole thing.       It authorized the FCC to modify the requirement to post rates, and the FCC simply eliminated the requirement to post rates, and we said that that was no good.       Where is this?     Do you want to tell us where it is?       It's very helpful to know what you're talking about.       Of course, it would strengthen your case if you would at least acknowledge that it would be constitutionally doubtful.     You wouldn't have to say it's bad, but if you said it's doubtful -       -- it would strengthen your case, wouldn't it?
10-680 +++$+++        Well, it certainly -- it certainly doesn't mean he can leave the prison, right?       That's clear, but -- but isn't that the only difference?     It, certainly, at a minimum, means that he can leave this interrogation.       But what could it possibly mean if it didn't mean you could leave this room where you're now being questioned?
10-694 +++$+++        Can I hear his answer? I was very interested in the question.     It seemed to make a good point.
10-699 +++$+++        What if -- what if the recognition of a breakaway province of a foreign country by the United States will clearly provoke a war with that country.     Would Congress have the power to decree that the President shall not recognize that breakaway province, knowing -- knowing that if he does recognize it, that country will declare war on the United States?       Contrary to our entire history, we have a - (Laughter.)       Please stay on this.      Our cases say repeatedly that the President is the sole instrument of the United States for the conduct of foreign policy, but to be the sole instrument and to determine the foreign policy are two quite different things.    To say he's the sole instrument simply means that congressmen traveling abroad or globetrotting ex-presidents -- nobody except the President of the United States pronounces the foreign policy.     But it doesn't necessarily mean that the President determines everything in foreign policy. He's the instrument, but there is certainly room in those many cases for saying that Congress can say what the -- what it's -- what the country's instrument is supposed to do.      Well, it's the best there is.      I mean, if you've got to cast about for something, I suppose -- I don't know what else you'd -- you'd land upon.      Well, it is there.    It doesn't say a whole lot.       This textual commitment applies when somebody comes to the Court and asks for the Court to make the decision.     If the plaintiff here had come in and -- without a congressional statute to rely upon, and had said, it is -- it is wrong for the State Department not to let me say "Israel" on my passport, then we would say, you know, textually committed to the executive. But this is a different situation where you have a -- a dispute between the two branches, and where that happens, I find it hard to say, well, you know, we can't get into it because why?     Because it's textually committed to one of the branches?     It seems to me we have to resolve that question.       Yes, I -- I wanted to follow up on that.     Does -- does that mean you're content to have this Court not say whether it's the exclusive executive power or -- or there's some congressional participation?     I mean, if we just abstain, if we just say it's none of our business, it's none of our business; let you two guys fight it out - that's not what you're asking us to do, is it?       You're asking us to decide the question that it is exclusively the presidential power.       That doesn't sound to me like -- you know, like abstaining because it's a political question.     It seems to me like deciding the case.
10-704 +++$+++       And the warrant authorized 20     the search for and seizure of all guns, not just the 21     guns belonging to Bowen.    And in --      And why is it -- if there's 3     probable cause to believe that he has other guns, is 4     there also probable cause to believe that any gun found 5     in the house will belong to him?    I think not.      Ultimately, it's the 14     officer who goes into the Millenders' house, seizes 15     their arms, rifles through their drawers.    It's -- it's 16     the officer that does that?      Oh, I didn't understand 24     that.      They -- they did not 2     execute the warrant?
10-708 +++$+++       You speak of a duty of loyalty.    There's no duty of loyalty owed here.    It was 2     just a law that said you cannot get -- and I'm not even 3     sure it's proper to call it a kickback.    It's a 4     commission.    These people are agents for the title 5     insurance company, and they get a commission on -- on 6     every sale of title insurance that they make.    You can 7     call it a kickback, I suppose.    I don't know why the 8     other side does.    But -- but it seems to me a commission.    There's no duty of loyalty.    Isn't -- isn't the seller here the agent of the title insurance 11     company?      But they didn't do that, 21     did they?      Well, the issue isn't 18     whether they can afford it legal protection.    They 19     certainly can.    And there can be suits by -- by the 20     Federal Government or, I think, under this statute even 21     by State -- State attorneys general.    The issue isn't 22     whether Congress can achieve that result.    It's whether 23     they can achieve it by permitting private suits.      If I take a car to an auto 2     mechanic, he's not my agent.    He's an independent 3     contractor doing business.    He's not my agent.      It's a customer going to 9     somebody who is an independent contractor.      More than agents and 16     fiduciaries across the board.    He is neither an agent 17     nor a fiduciary.    And what's the closest case you have 18     to a situation where there is neither an agency relationship nor a trust relationship, and yet this kind 20     of a right to sue without showing damage exists?    What's 21     the -- what's your best shot?      And you don't want to have 9     to prove that, because if you proved any damage, there goes your class action --      -- because you don't have 13     commonality.      How does it -- how does it 21     harm her to get a title insurance policy for the price 22     of $453 from what you call a kickback-free seller, as 23     opposed to getting the same title insurance for $453 24     from a non-kickback-free seller?    Is that an 25     injury-in-fact?      The -- the vague notion 3     of -- of buying it from -- from -- I don't know, a white 4     knight?    Is that the kind of injury-in-fact that our 5     cases talk about?      It seems to me purely -- I 8     don't know -- philosophical.      Doubtless Congress wanted 11     to get out of the business.    But the issue here is 12     whether Congress can get out of the business, whether it 13     is the function of courts to provide relief to people 14     who haven't been injured.    I mean, that's -- that's -- 15     that's the whole issue.      Suppose -- Mr. Yang, let 6     me give -- give you a hypothetical.    Suppose, you know, 7     Congress did this to spare the Attorney General the 8     necessity of suing to enforce these requirements. 9     Suppose Congress wants to take the burden off the back of the Internal Revenue Service.      Why not?      But this is differentiated. You have to have bought from one of these companies. 2     It's not everybody.    Not everybody has bought from these 3     tax cheats.      It's only the people who 6     bought from tax cheats.      A nexus, right?    Your brief 13     is full of "nexus" --      It's legal jargon for 16     "connection."      Okay.      How much of a connection 8     is -- is necessary?    Suppose you have a law that requires all machine parts produced by companies to -- 10     to contain a certain feature, and anyone who buys one 11     that doesn't contain that feature gets $500.    I purchase 12     one.    That feature is of no use to me at all.    That 13     product would be just as good for me for the purposes 14     for which I am using it had it not had that feature. 15                 Would that be okay?    Would I have a cause of 16     action?      500 bucks.
10-76 +++$+++        Tell me why it is that the general principles of jurisdiction do apply here, and then we can get to waiver.       Don't leave me dangling like that. (Laughter.)       Excuse me.     Case-specific is not talking about general jurisdiction.       It's talking about specific jurisdiction.       Okay.     Just give me a list of -- of what -- what factors you think support general jurisdiction here.       One, two, three, four -       Which ones are they?       Well, the question isn't whether they did that; the question is whether it was right to do that.       I mean, you don't make your point by saying that the court of appeals made a mistake.       Well, I mean, those arrangements could exist with a lot of distributors. You don't want to ship a distributor stuff that the distributor is not going to be using.       I mean, my goodness.     The fact that you coordinate with your distributor how much of your product you're going to ship to him doesn't - doesn't really show -       -- that you are a unitary business with your distributor.       At page 265 of the brief? I didn't read that many pages.       Do you think he'd rather be sued in China?       I wouldn't.     I don't know why anybody would.       It's just not unfairness and undue burden.     It's a matter of what -- what power a sovereign has.       I mean, it could be perfectly fair if you announce that you're going to assert jurisdiction over anybody who harms an American citizen anywhere in the world, and you give notice to every manufacturer in the world.     That would be perfectly fair, but you have no power to do that under -- under accepted notions of what a sovereign can do.       Only if you believe that burden is the only issue.     The issue is power, not just burden.
10-779 +++$+++        I don't take "biased" to mean false.     "Biased" means one-sided.       You state the true facts only on one side and not the other.       This case has not been argued as a case restricting false advertising, has it?
10-788 +++$+++        You would acknowledge that if someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does not testify, that person could be sued if indeed the instigation was malicious?       Well, now, just answer my question.     I've given you a hypothetical.     He -- no doubt he instigated the grand jury proceeding.     He got the -- the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding, but he didn't testify.     Could that person be sued?       Okay.     So, all he has to do to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he should testify, right?     His testimony bathes him clean; is that it?       All right.     So, then it -- so, all you're arguing, then, is that there has to be some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that your point?       Okay.       I don't understand how it's waived.     I don't understand that.     How was it waived?       I don't understand.       Yes.
10-8145 +++$+++        And not only the only eyewitness but, if I understand it correctly, the only evidence against the defendant.     This was the only evidence against him, this one eyewitness identification, right?     Was there anything else?       Well --       You don't say all of them. All of them didn't apply to the --       That applied to everyone, right?       The one at the scene applied to everyone.       "I can't identify anyone."       Yes.       Okay.       I -- may I suggest that --       -- you stop fighting as to whether it should be turned over?     Of course, it should have been turned over.     I think the case you're making is that it wouldn't have made a difference.       And -- and that's a closer case, perhaps, but surely it should have been turned over.     Why don't you give that up?
10-844 +++$+++       Can you give us of the cite 21     of that, please?      You don't have to do it 25     now.    Just -- just file it with the Court.    I don't want to eat your time up.      I don't really care. 11                 (Laughter.)      What do you mean by the 2     problem of improper listing?      And we -- we don't decide whether we have authority to decide cases on the basis 2     of what the agency thinks.
10-8505 +++$+++       She said      She didn't just say, I got 18     something back from the lab, and I relied on whatever 19     that said.    No, she said what she had gotten back from 20     the lab, and she did not know, of her personal 21     knowledge, that it was what she said it was.      She didn't know if they had 5     incompetent people there.    The last case we had involving this kind of an issue, the reason they didn't 7     bring in the lab technician to testify was that he had 8     been fired in the interim for some reason which we didn't know, but it was pretty clear why -- why he would 10     not have been a very good witness.    We don't know how 11     good this lab was.    We don't know how good the 12     individuals who did the test were. And that's why it's up to the State to bring 14     forward testimony saying what the lab did.    And the only 15     testimony they brought forward was the testimony of this 16     witness who was not there.      If she said that, I would 24     agree with you.    But she said more than that.    She said, 25     I relied on material provided by Cellmark which is.... And then she described what that material was, and she 2     had no personal knowledge of that.      No, but Cellmark says this 15     is the male DNA that was found in the sample that was 16     sent.    Cellmark made that decision, right?    And her 17     testimony was based upon the fact -- was based upon 18     comparing that male DNA with -- with her own blood 19     sample.    It's meaningless unless that male DNA was 20     indeed the defendant's.      You know, I would believe that if the prosecution put the question to -- to her 2     this way:    Assume that you got a report which said that 3     this was the defendant's DNA.    And if you were to match 4     that with this -- the work you've done on the blood 5     sample, would you find that -- that, you know, that the 6     sample was taken from the defendant?    And she would say 7     yes.    And the jury would say:    So what? I mean, you've just -- you've just made a 9     hypothesis.    "If you had been told."    That -- that would be worth nothing.      She was asked, just -- just 6     to be clear what she was testifying to from the blood of Sandy Williams?" 11                 "Yes, I did." She is accepting and -- and affirming this 13     statement that what she was comparing was the semen that 14     had been identified from the vaginal swabs.      Mr. Dreeben, that seems to 21     me -- I mean, we have a Confrontation Clause which 22     requires that the witnesses against the defendant appear 23     and testify personally.    And -- and the crucial evidence 24     here is the testing of the semen found on the swab. 25     That is -- that's the crux of this evidence.    And you're telling me that this Confrontation Clause allows you to 2     simply say, well, we're not going to bring in the person 3     who did the test; we're simply going to say this is a 4     reliable lab. I don't know how that complies with the 6     Confrontation Clause.      What was the instruction 8     here?    That --      So, we simply have a 14     presumption even though -- even though the court's 15     statement seems to indicate that he does take it for the 16     truth of the matter.      And you're saying, well, he 19     couldn't have because that would be against the law. 20                 MR. DREEBEN amendment of my description of the facts to include that 2     Cellmark is an accredited laboratory.    That does add to 3     the probative value.    But it's a much weaker chain of 4     support to conclude that the DNA male profile came from 5     the semen than if they had produced Cellmark.    But not 6     having produced Cellmark, they do not need to afford 7     confrontation on Cellmark.
10-875 +++$+++ 
10-879 +++$+++        But only the design, materials, and constructions for use.     If you make that concession, it's only those aspects of design, materials, and construction that pertain to use.     And if you take the position that use includes only use on the line and not use when it's being repaired in the repair shop, I think you're in trouble.       It's design for use.       I'm not talking about the word "design"; I'm talking about "design for use."       What would apply to the repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use, I suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the manufacturer that although the engine he has manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer: Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have to give you warning. I mean, I cannot imagine that that's what -- that that's what the statute means as applied, at least to the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.       Can the manufacturer be held liable for failing to tell the railroad?       How is the railroad going to know whether it's unsafe or not?       How is the railroad going to know whether there's asbestos in there unless the manufacturer at least tells the railroad, even it doesn't have to tell the worker?       Well, they're -- they're not saying here you have to manufacture it a certain way.     They're just saying if you manufacture it in a manner that we consider unsafe, you have to warn people.
10-895 +++$+++        Mr. Mitchell, do you think the court of appeals could do it nunc pro tunc without -- without first making the determination that the trial judge was supposed to have made?       But he would have to make the determination required by (c)(1), no?       Yes.     And --       And that wouldn't necessarily point him just to the Speedy Trial Act. He'd have to see what other constitutional claims are in the case, right?  (Laughter.)  Right. -- and then come back. So there!
10-8974 +++$+++        But that's not -- we face that problem anyway, even if we -- whether or not we decide in this case that it doesn't matter that the police manipulated it, we're always going to have the problem of when has there been police manipulation; right?       I mean, that -- that's not a creation of this -- of this case.       And I -- I would guess that in the case you're talking about, just telling the person to stay where he is, is not -- now, it would be different if -- if the defendant was -- was caught two blocks away and the police bring him back to the scene of the crime and make him stand there so that the woman can see him from the window.     That's quite different.
10-930 +++$+++        Excuse me.     If the client is incompetent, you -- you bring both claims, right? You -- you both -- you both challenge the guilt, and you challenge the sentence.       So why -- why -- why is it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so that the client can tell you not to bring one of those things?     I don't know why that's unfair.       But you can't get that in, right?     I mean, aren't you limited to the record?     So what -- what use is it --       -- to -- to find out these little -- little secret things that your client knows, if they cannot be admitted?
10-945 +++$+++        Two arms' lengths.     I mean, he could reach out, right?       But, Mr. Phillips, there - there -       There is still an issue in the case beyond the ordinary visual inspection, and that is this:     Even though you have changed your policy now -       -- the question remains whether that change in policy was constitutionally required, so that when -- when you treated the -- the plaintiff in a different fashion under the old policy, that was a violation of the Constitution. Doesn't -- doesn't that question remain in the case?       Okay.     So, there are two questions.       So, we have to consider both, the pure visual and also the inspection for contraband.       You -- you want us to write an opinion that applies only to squatting and coughing. Is that it?       Yes. (Laughter.)
10-948 +++$+++        Right.     And -- and you don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need something more than a provision dealing with what you have to tell to the people who -- who accept these contracts.     I mean it's not in the substantive part of the statute.     It's in the part of the statute that tells you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to notify the consumer of.     It's a very strange way for Congress to say "no arbitration" by putting this language in a section that has nothing to do with the rights under the Act.       It is intended to be a summary of the rights under the Act.       Do you think that Gilmer would have come out differently with regard to one of the procedural rights involved in that case if the statute had happened to refer to that procedural right as a right?     Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?       So, and if the statute in Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in passing as a right, you think that one would have been non-waivable?       But procedural rights are rights.     I mean, to denominate it as a right is --       Exactly.       Yes, but --       But you're saying -- in answer to my question, you're saying that just because the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute uses our normal language, those procedural rights are elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be waived.     That can't be right.       I don't think that referring to a procedural right as a right creates any inference at all.     It is a right.       Well -- well, I guess it goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to me.     Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of rights provision would normally be read to mean non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural right to sue as a "right," eliminates that presumption. So, I presume, therefore, that your position is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot be waived.     Because, I mean, that's what we're talking about:     What does "right" mean --       -- when it says rights are not waived?     And our prior case law says ordinarily that means only substantive rights.     But here in this statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is certainly a procedural right, as a right.     So, I presume all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise cannot be waived.       Oh, there are none?
10-9646 +++$+++        So -- so, it may not be realistic to speak of mandatory life without parole. It's only mandatory if the youth is convicted of the highest charge brought, but it remains within the power of the jury, in light of the youth, to convict him of a -- of a lesser offense which would not produce mandatory life imprisonment without parole.       -- about this case, because I thought you were appealing to what the American people think about the line or maybe to the common law.     Now, the common law had a rule of -- of the age of reason. I think below 12, you couldn't -- at least you couldn't impose the death penalty.     Maybe you couldn't even convict for a felony.     But you just pluck some number out of the air.       Why can't I pluck a number out of the air if you pluck one out of the air?       Do you have any reason to think that juveniles are any better than anyone else as far as learning from prison is concerned?     I mean, recidivism is a big problem, isn't it?     People who've been to prison go out and commit the same crimes again, don't they?       Is there any reason to think that juveniles are any different?
10-98 +++$+++        Do you acknowledge that it is then constitutional?     Your -- your opening comments make me think you don't even acknowledge that it's constitutional then?       But the Fourth Amendment doesn't say you need probable cause.     There are situations where you can conduct a search without probable cause.     There's the Terry search.     There's administrative searches.     There's a lot of exceptions.       Administrative searches, automobile searches, you know.       You're -- you're going way beyond what I thought you were arguing.     You're saying you always have to make that determination of good faith, right?     In -- in all cases, including when the prosecution is -- is accused of -- of bringing a prosecution purely for harassment purposes?       That's what I thought you were saying.
10-9995 +++$+++        Didn't the State adhere to that?       It kept its word, didn't it?       You say you didn't abandon the right.     Isn't that your position?     You did not abandon it?     You just --       You just gave up the -- the opportunity to raise it yourself.       Those are sunk costs, aren't they, Mr. Domenico?       It's water over the dam, and the issue is whether the court of appeals will then have to repeat the district court's excursus into the merits.       Right?       And the court of appeals could have gotten mad at the fact that the district court was compelled to go through the merits, right?       And for that reason could have denied it.     But it didn't get mad, I guess.     I don't know why.
105, Orig. +++$+++              It's not a matter of unfairness to Einstein anyway.               I mean, you know, the expert witness is going to get his money.             The question is --             The question is whether one side can get some money from the other to help pay for it. Do you happen to know whether at the time the original jurisdiction of this Court was established, there was such a thing as the charging of expert witness fees?              I don't either.              The Constitution says that no money shall be -- shall be withdrawn from the Treasury except by appropriations made by law.             I think -- I think you need a law to spend -- to spend the government's money.             Could I ask you what -- what are the fees to be charged by its clerk, referred to in 1911.    "Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its clerk," and then the next paragraph says the fees of the clerk.        Is that what the first paragraph refers to, the fees of the clerk?                 Or does it mean other fees that the clerk charges which could include costs? Are the costs part of the fees to be charged by the clerk?             They are not?      Fees of the clerk -- in 1920 says fees of the clerk in Marshall, but that could be taxed as costs.             Right?        A judge or clerk can tax as costs the following. 1911 says Supreme Court may fix "the fees to be charged by its clerk," and you say that doesn't include costs.   Boy, it's a messy, messy bunch of statutes, don't you think?               Well --               Well, that's some comfort.               Yes, but that taxes costs, and it doesn't say the Supreme Court may fix costs.                  May fix the fees to be charged by its clerk, which you say don't include costs.               So that wouldn't allow to us fix that.              Well, it tells you how they are to be taxed.   It doesn't say what their level is to be.   May be taxed against the litigants as the court directs, but I don't see any authority to fix them -- fix the amounts.   It's not a very good statute, really.              Maybe lawyers get even more.                And you don't get that back either.                 What if Congress -- really you think Congress could set any -- there's not some point at which it is so destructive of the process here? What if Congress provides that the winning -- that the winning party shall pay the costs of the losing party? Can Congress do that?
11-10189 +++$+++        There's clearly no Martinez protection.     The question you are being asked, I think, boils down to whether we should develop a new case, Martinez plus, in which -- even though there is, technically, the ability to raise it, which is all that Martinez spoke about, the mere fact that the ability to raise it is not effective enough should produce the same result that Martinez produced. Page 40 I don't think there is any -- I'm not even sure the other side claims that Martinez said what -- what he is arguing here.       It was the nose of the camel, which is what Martinez was -- which is what the Page 43 dissent said, actually. (Laughter.)
11-1025 +++$+++        Does that assessment take into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon the government's ability to intercept these communications?       With the obligation to apply the Fourth Amendment.       But if as you say those procedures violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter what the statute says.       If those statutory provisions would produce a violation of the Fourth Amendment, they are null and void, right?       Okay.     So the FISA Court would presumably know that.       Excuse me, before we go further.     A reasonable reaction to the risk; but it doesn't have to be a reasonable reaction to a certainly impending risk, does it?       But that's his question. Doesn't it undermine the certainly impending?       Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart from the government's power that you point out to conduct some of this surveillance without approval by the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year, leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this statute can be characterized as a facial challenge, because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment violation, doesn't it?       Well, it -- it can say it's unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us. Don't you think the FISA court is able to say, what we're allowed to look into under this statute does not comport with the Fourth Amendment.       We have to look into more.
11-10362 +++$+++        Well, you don't think the EPA is engaged in law enforcement when it enforces statutes and regulations, do you?       Would an officer of the EPA be a law enforcement officer when he writes a letter to a company saying, you know, you are violating section such-and-such of the statute?     Is that a law enforcement officer?       You are saying that the Government is trying to minimize the consequences of coming out its way by providing a definition of the officers covered, which will not hold.     You think it does cover a broader category of officers including OSHA inspectors, but it does not cover them when they are not engaged in law enforcement activities.
11-1059 +++$+++        Well, it undermines the collective aspect, if she never brings the suit in the first place.     I mean, I -- I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed by the fact that -- you know, if she drops out there is -- there is no collective suit for these other people.     There is also no collective suit for these other people if she never appeared in the first place. I don't -- I don't know that the law demands that there be a collective suit.     If she doesn't bring suit or if she brings suit and -- and is given everything she wants, the case is over, unless other people have come in.       It -- it's hard for me to accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes when -- when it's clear, under the statute, that if parties come in beyond the statute of limitations period, they're not in.     Their -- their entry is not deemed to relate back to the filing of the original complaint, is it?       For purposes of the statute of -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the statute and a different one for what we're discussing here.       I know you do.       Mr. Yang, would -- would you continue with what you started speaking to, issue preclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's questionable whether there would be issue preclusion on the basis of a judgment issued with the concession of the defendant.
11-1085 +++$+++        Mr. Frederick, you -- you say that -- you know, it's a flukey hypothetical where -- where the -- the issue here would -- would come up again in a different context in an individual suit. Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's -- that's not flukey and hypothetical.     That is, it is usually the case that -- that people who are allegedly defrauded in stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an -- at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price. Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of the market. If the market is not efficient, a question that has to be decided for the class certification case, the individual investor is not going to be able to say, you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because the market reflected this false statement, and I paid more money for the stock than I should have.     That -- that is not a flukey hypothetical.     That is what will happen in most individual cases.     And yet, that question of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the class certification stage.       You could say the same about materiality.     If it's immaterial, it isn't reflected in -- in the market.       So -- so the difference you assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will be an issue in all individual cases; whereas with regard to the efficiency of the market, it will only be an issue in -- what, 95 percent of -- of the individual cases?       The issue -- the issue is not whether -- whether it's a common question or not.       The issue is whether there's any reason to believe that the -- that the market reflects reality.       That's the issue.       But there is -- there is a reason for deciding it earlier, and the reason is the -- the enormous pressure to settle once the class is certified.     In most cases, that's the end of the lawsuit.     There's -- there's automatically a settlement. Now, one way of -- of certifying the class is to show, well, you know, it's an efficient market, and you can presume that everybody in the class relied on the market.     But that's only true if -- if the -- the statement was material to the market.     If it was immaterial to the market, that isn't true.     And you should not proceed any further, and you should not begin this -- this class action which, in -- in most cases, is simply the preliminary to a settlement.     There is a good reason for deciding it sooner.       What's the difference between 100 percent and 95 percent?     I mean, most of the other claims in -- in stock cases are going to be based on what -- what the market price was when the person bought or sold.     So -- you know, 95 percent instead of 100 percent, that's -- that's the basic difference?       If you have the same question, then maybe we shouldn't have this fraud-on-the-market theory because the whole purpose of it is -- is to -- to assume that -- that the whole class was -- was damaged and relied -- because you can rely on an efficient market.     But you can only rely on an efficient market where there has been a material misrepresentation. So maybe we should overrule Basic because it was certainly based upon a theory that -- that simply collapses once you remove the materiality element.       Materiality is a common issue.     Reliance is only a common issue if you accept the fraud-on-the-market theory.     That's the problem. And you are using the one, which is a common issue, to leapfrog into the second, to make the -- the efficiency of the market reasoning something that it isn't.       Or, to put it differently, an efficient market is a market that takes account of material factors, right?       It's not an efficient market if it's -- you know -- it's -- who knows, random? It takes account of material factors.
11-1118 +++$+++        Excuse me.     I guess I just don't understand this.     Is it the case that there is "arising under" jurisdiction only when the Federal cause of action presented is one over which Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction?       Is that -- is that the rule?       I mean, any -- any Federal statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not come within this "arising under" rule?       Do you have a case for that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal question as to which this Court would be the -- you know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come within "arising under" jurisdiction? Have you got a case for that.       Do you have a case which says that, when a Federal question is presented in a case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the issue, such a case cannot come within the "arising under" jurisdiction?       I would find it extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule.       I mean, is that -- my goodness, but you are going to have a purely hypothetical State decision here.     The State will have held that -- you know, if -- if he had said this, the result would have been something else.     And you think that that precludes the -- the issue when it arises in real life? And you say, since the State court made that hypothetical determination, it precludes me from arguing it in -- in real life.       Do you have any cases like that?     It seems, to me, a rather weird -- weird situation.     I mean, maybe it could, but it -- it's strange.       They knew -- they knew these were controverted issues.     You say that they -- they are controverted issues.     So they would have been alerted to a problem anyway.     And they certainly would not accept a State court determination as authoritative resolution of that problem.       The patent attorneys.     I mean, you --       Excuse me.     The State courts are not bound by the Federal court's holding? You mean State courts can resolve patent questions, contrary to what the Supreme Court of the United States says the law is?       Why is that worse than the fact that, if it goes to Federal court, all of the lawyers in the State, in all malpractice cases, are going to be, supposedly, bound by the Federal court's holding as to State issues of malpractice? I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive on those issues. So I don't -- I don't know why --       And you -- you are trying the malpractice lawsuit -- the State malpractice lawsuit, in Federal court.       So you are talking about a case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court?       Well, then I repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do and which of those don't?       Well, my -- my experience is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast as they can.
11-1160 +++$+++        Well, I -- I don't see how any of that pertains to whether they can create a hospital monopoly.     You can do all of that, even though you are not the only hospital in the area.       Well, but the only respect relevant here is -- is -- the only respect relevant is the ability to acquire other hospitals.       Right?     And that's -- and that's a general corporate power.     Every corporation in Georgia has the power to acquire, including acquire other businesses.       Well, a lot of States have that.     You can't open a new hospital without getting a certificate of need.     Are you saying that, in all of those, States the -- the result is that the antitrust laws can be ignored?       Mr. Waxman, if you don't want to be interrupted, you have to pause between sentences. (Laughter.)       I understand.     That's right. You've given a -- you know, an appealing example of a small county that has one -- one hospital, and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital. Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be pursuing a situation in which there is a natural monopoly.     It's a question of whether the monopoly would be owned by the State or not. But your argument, if we follow it, embraces a quite different situation, a very large county which has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as some hospitals do. And what you're saying is that this operation can take over all of those hospitals and eliminate all of that competition.     Isn't that so?       Yes.       We have no -- we have no idea whether they are willing to do that.       And we have a Federal antitrust law.       Why -- why didn't it intend this?     I don't understand.     You -- you've told us that they did intend this, that they did intend to displace competition.       And now, you say, but Georgia will say, oh, no, they didn't intend to displace competition.       Which is it?
11-1175 +++$+++        In -- in that respect, it is different from RadLAX, in which the two provisions - where we held the specific covers the general -- but we held that because the two provisions contradicted each other.       Love and marriage. (Laughter.)       We have a lot of cases that say that -- that the agency's views about what courts should do are not entitled to deference.     This is -- this is a matter --       I guess, in the first sentence of 3, the phrase "the costs of the action" is really superfluous in light of 54(d)(1).     You really don't know that.     I mean, that would have been the case anyway. So there's no reason to think that it isn't frivolous in the second sentence -- or superfluous in the second sentence, right?     Why did they have to say the costs of the action in the case of a successful action?       The costs of the action, together with a reasonable -- as determined by the court.       They -- they have the costs anyway, if Congress didn't write anything, right?       I'm trying to help you. (Laughter.)       Gotcha.       Well-taken.
11-1221 +++$+++        Yes, I guess -- I guess you might -- you might respond also that, you know, it's characterized by -- by your -- your friend as a -- a State law having to do with -- with marriage and -- and so forth.     Maybe. But maybe it's just a State law having to do with discernment of intent.     And here you have a Federal statute and I guess the Federal Congress's assertion of what's the best discernment of intent, in the natural order of things, ought to prevail over the State's assessment of what's -- what's the clearest expression of intent, right? I don't know why it's a family law provision as much as it is a provision of what the presumed intent of -- of a decedent is.     And here the -- the Federal Government has spoken to it with respect to a Federal statute, and I don't know why it isn't intruding upon State family law for -- for the Federal Government to - to assert, in its own right, intent under this statute is -- is determined this way.
11-1231 +++$+++        Of course, nobody -- nobody intends that when they -- when they adopt an absolute rule.     I mean, you -- you can create a horrible with respect to any absolute jurisdictional rule.     That's easy to do.     So the mere fact that -- that a horrible could occur does -- does not at all persuade me that -- that a rule is not absolute.       Of course -- of course, one can always make an argument on the other side, and the mere fact that an argument is made on the other side does not prove that it's not clear.     That's what lawyers do.     They make arguments on the other side.       I thought the 3 years provision applied only to the Secretary, that she gives herself 3 years to go back and sort things out, but only gives you 180 days; is that right?       Is that reopening -- is that reopening provision, the mysterious gg, is -- is that subject to equitable tolling, too?       And if not, why not?
11-1274 +++$+++        I don't think the common law held that it didn't accrue.     I think it was an exception to the accrual rule, that, even though it accrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit where -- where discovery is made later.     I -- is that the way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue until discovery?       Well, you are making the argument, so you ought to fight about it.       And never in a criminal case, right?     Do you have a single case in which the discovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case with respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction?       Not a single one.       You'd expect that - you'd expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred years.       Fraud is nothing new, for Pete's sake.       This is brand-new assertion by the government that -- tell -- is there much difference between the rule you are arguing for and a rule that there is no statute of limitations?       It's not a matter of there being nothing on either side of the ledger.     What's extraordinary is that the government has never asserted this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed and -- and repudiated its position.     It isn't just that there are no cases against you.     It's you've never -- the government has never asserted it before.       The False Claims Act example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a case.       Yes, you can say the government, having been cheated, should have known it was cheated.     But we are talking here about prosecution, essentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than a criminal.     By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity apply whether the penalty is criminal or civil?     So if I think the word "accrual" is, at best, ambiguous, shouldn't the tie go to the defendant?       But my question is broader than that.     Does the rule of lenity not apply to all penalties?       Are you sure of that?     My belief is the contrary.       Well, it's an important issue in this case, surely.     I mean, if "accrual" is ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should interpret it to favor the defendant.       He didn't concede that there was fraudulent concealment.     All he conceded is that there was fraud, but later concealment to cover up that fraud I don't think has been conceded.       Except that concealment is sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter.     You -- you -- it -- it doesn't apply always.     It applies when there is concealment, and the person who is being subjected to the longer statute of limitations is on notice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending the statute.     So I -- I don't think that the one has to go with the other.     Maybe they're both equitable doctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we have to apply them to this statute.       And for 300 years, that has been said only with respect to civil actions, not with respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty.       And you will say nonsense in that future case, won't you? (Laughter.)       What about criminal penalties?     Would your argument be different with regard to criminal?       Incidentally, what makes something a civil penalty?     You just call it a civil penalty and -- and you don't have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this extension that you are arguing for?       What makes -- what makes a penalty a civil penalty?       I mean, a penalty is a penalty as far as I'm concerned if the government's taking money from me.       That's nice.       That isn't my point, that it is criminal.     My point is, it doesn't seem to me to make a whole lot of difference as far as these issues are concerned.
11-1285 +++$+++        Your opponent says this is not a subrogation agreement, so that argument goes nowhere.     He would concede that point.     You have to tell us why this is a subrogation agreement, even though you conceded below that it isn't.       That's not what I say you've conceded.     That's the common fund doctrine.     Your opponent denies that the common fund doctrine applies. And it says this is an equitable lien by agreement, so that the common fund doctrine doesn't apply. Now, you -- you say it is not an equitable lien by agreement?     Is that your position?       So whenever you have a contract that explicitly, although -- you know, nowadays when the merged bars, I suppose, you wouldn't even have to say it, but let's assume it explicitly says that rights under this contract can be enforced in law or -- at law or in equity. Whenever -- whenever you have a contract like that, it's going to be up to the court of equity to decide whether it's fair?       Why isn't this a legal claim?     It's -- it's a promise made in a contract. Why -- why is that not a legal claim? To be sure, the contract says that -- that -- you know, all equitable remedies are available to enforce that claim.     But why is it an equitable claim, not a legal claim?       What -- what case is this?       From what court, what -- what year?
11-1327 +++$+++        So if -- if the judge did this on her own, that would have been okay?     And there would be Double Jeopardy attaching?       So we have to decide in each case whether the defendant was the initiating source of the error?       What -- what if the defendant just agrees with the judge?     The judge says -- you know, I think this indictment is bad because you -- you have to show that it wasn't a dwelling place, and the counsel for the Defendant says, yes, that seems like a good -- a good idea.     Is -- is that enough to --       Well, my goodness, disagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it? (Laughter.)       A bird in the hand, counsel.     I -- I --       Well, we didn't have it, at the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to do that.     I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and how it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was certainly a -- an open question. It's not as though this procedure existed at the time of the founding or in English law before then and was never adequate to -- to constitute Double Jeopardy.     It's a new procedure introduced, so the question for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the acquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy?       Well, that's every misinterpretation.     I mean, I don't know why this case doesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the elements of the crime are.     I mean, any misinterpretation, you can -- which goes beyond the minimum that the -- that the statute requires, can be recharacterized as adding an additional element.       So you're saying that your -- your approach doesn't solve the bench trial problem any more than your friend's approach, right?       Finish the sentence. Notwithstanding that, what?       Is that important, "at defendant's behest"?       So you -- you're arguing that this should only -- only be -- this rule should only be applied when the defendant asks for it?
11-1347 +++$+++        I thought he had said the same thing, that the reason --       Well, good. (Laughter.)       So are you arguing that the effect of the statute implementing the treaty, which uses "forthwith" and all of this, is to, in effect, require that, unless there is a motion for a stay pending, the decision of the trial court be carried out?       You -- you think the -- the mere word "forthwith" in the statute is enough to alter our normal process of appeal?       I thought -- I thought that's what you were saying.
11-1351 +++$+++        But it didn't -- it didn't want to say it shall not apply for everything.     It didn't want to eliminate the intentional tort exception for everybody, right?     It only wanted to eliminate it for the people covered by -- by the Gonzalez Act.       It might have said that, but, if it wanted to be more parsimonious in its language, it could simply say for purposes of this section.       Which section applies only to these particular individuals.       It was a -- it was a different Congress.     They don't always use the same language.     Come on.       You're -- you're lucky they even remember the earlier statutes. (Laughter.)       -- I wouldn't think that -- that you would say it is patterned after another Act, where you change a very basic provision, whether suit can be brought against the United States or not.       I mean, that's sort of rudimentary and fundamental to it.     It doesn't seem to me they would say it's patterned after it.     But -- you know, I -- I don't care. (Laughter.)       Thank you.     Thank you, dear colleague.     I appreciate that. (Laughter.)       I don't think those are the key words.     I think the key words are "shall not apply." "Shall not apply."       It isn't shall be deemed inapplicable.       It is not a hypothetical. It says, "They shall not apply to any cause of action," etc.       Why -- why else was it there?     Just for fun? (Laughter.)       It was obviously there to support your position.     Now, your position would have been the same.     Now, that's true.     Your position would have been identical, but the only purpose of that argument was to support that position.       I don't find that inconsistent with the position argued.     There -- you are talking about the statement that the sole purpose was -- was to --       I don't think it is the sole purpose, even if you -- you accept your friend's interpretation.       No, no.     The sole purpose is to assure immunity to these doctors.     Now, in assuring immunity to these doctors, we -- we are not going to leave these people without any remedy, and so we allowed them a remedy against the United States. That's subsidiary to the sole purpose of the Act.     Sure, the sole purpose is to -- is to -- is to help these doctors.     But, in order to do it and be fair at the same time, you have to allow suit against the United States.     I think you could still say the sole purpose was to help the doctors.       Mr. Shah, can I ask you why -- if your interpretation is correct, Subsection (e) did not read -- not for purposes of this section, but rather for purposes of Subsection (a), the provisions of (h) shall not apply?
11-139 +++$+++        No, and if it is -- according to Brand X, if it specifically addressed the question and said that there was no ambiguity.     But according to Brand X, if there's ambiguity, despite a holding of this Court, the agency can effectively overrule a holding by a regulation, right?     Isn't that what Brand X says?       So, the only question here is, as the Chief Justice put it, whether -- whether indeed Colony meant by "ambiguous" ambiguous.       It depends on what the meaning of "ambiguous" is, right? (Laughter.)       I never thought that a revision of a statute of limitation was retroactive legislation, just as I've never thought that a provision altering rules of evidence for a crime, even for crimes that were committed before that alteration, is retroactive legislation.       You know, the crucial date is the date -- at least it's not -- well, you can extend the statute of limitations.       No, I --       So, say it's unfair, but I'm not sure that the rule against -- presumption against retroactivity technically applies.
11-1425 +++$+++        Is this a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing?     I mean, what -- what advantage do you think your client would -- would really get from the warrant requirement other than the delay that that would entail allowing his blood alcohol to reduce itself? Are the -- for some warrants, let's say a warrant to go into a building where the police contend there may be drugs, the policeman will -- will you know, the magistrate will say, What evidence do you have that there's drugs?     Well -- you know, two weeks ago we had this informer, yesterday we saw this and so -- you know, all sorts of different factors. In these DUI cases it's always going to be the same thing.     The policeman is going to say, well -- you know, his breath smelled of alcohol; we gave him the walk a straight line and turn around test, he flunked it; he couldn't touch his nose with his index finger. What is the impartial magistrate possibly going to do except to say, hey -- you know, that's probable cause. Are any of these warrants ever turned down? Are they ever turned down in your experience?       I bet you they're not.       But in many of them there is a lot of judgment that has to be brought to bear:     Is this a reliable informant, how long ago did he tell you, and so forth.     Whereas, in all of these cases it's going to be the same thing:     His breath smelled of alcohol, he couldn't walk a straight line, and whatnot.     And -- and that's the probable cause.     And I don't see how the independent magistrate is going to do you a whole lot of good, except for the fact that it will delay the process.       It bears considerably on the reasonableness, doesn't it?     I don't know why you want to bite off more than you can chew.       It's a different case and what is reasonable for sticking a needle in your arm is not necessarily reasonable for asking you to blow up a balloon.       I thought -- I thought you would also distinguish the drug flush cases on -- on the ground that violation of the integrity of your home is somewhat less than violation of the integrity of your body.       And that goes into the reasonableness determination.
11-1447 +++$+++        Well, it doesn't raise Penn Central.     You keep on running away from it by saying Penn Central or Lucas.       It does not deprive the land of all value.     The land still has some value.     Penn Central is totally out of the case.       As I understand your position, cash is magical, right?     The -- the government can come in and -- come into my house, take all of the cash that's there, and that is not the basis for a takings claim, right?     Because cash is not -- is not a taking. Does that make any sense?       Right.       The stopping point is don't take my cash.       Your -- your answer to my question is, that's okay, it's not a taking, right?       I may have some other cause of action, but not a -- not a taking?     The government's come in and taken my money.       I'm not talking Nollan and Dolan.     I'm talking about your position that the taking of cash cannot be a taking.       Oh, I see, I see.       If they -- if they say, you have to turn over to us whatever money you have in your house, or you have to turn over to us whatever's in your bank account, that's not a taking.       What if they do it to five or six other landowners, okay?       Really?     Gee, that doesn't strike me as -- as entirely true.       You mean a tax that is imposed only on landowners, and it's -- you know, it's a tax -- $5,000 per landowner, if that were replaced by a provision that said, every -- every landowner shall contribute to the State a portion of his property worth $5,000, that --       The latter is bad, and the former's okay?       That surprises me.       Justification is the protection of wetlands.     That's a justification, the protection of wetlands. There's no necessary comparison, as Nollan and Dolan requires, between the harm that would be occasioned if the permit were granted and what the State is exacting in order to mitigate. That -- that doesn't exist anywhere in -- in the analysis that you are talking about.       Now, that is a problem. (Laughter.)       What was taken in Nollan and Dolan?       In Nollan, was it the easement that was taken?       Well, but it -- wasn't what was taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to make the alterations to his house that he wanted to make?     He wanted to add another story and the court -- and the State said, you can't do it. And its only basis for saying, you can't do it was because you wouldn't give us the easement.       Isn't this unreal?     I mean, you are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the agency says, if you do X, you get the permit.     And X is -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition. Okay.     He refuses to do X.     The permit is denied with a general statement like this:     The permit is denied because he has refused to do the -- the necessary mitigation. Isn't it clear that the reason he's refused to do the necessary mitigation, is he has refused the last demand of the agency?
11-1450 +++$+++        Or the State court could find, oh yes, it is -- the claim is worth a lot more than 5 million, but it's worth that amount to be in this generous court for these generous juries.     And so you're really not harming these absent plaintiffs because they ought to want to be here.     We've got juries and very favorable judges.     Couldn't it find that?       I understand it, but -- but I'm just addressing your point which you blithely say, if the -- if the representation is inadequate, if indeed it's worth a lot more, that will be handled.     Not necessarily.     The State court could find, and I suspect this State court would find, that it's worth the money to be in State court.
11-1518 +++$+++        I don't understand.     Where does this reckless act come from?     Where do you get reckless act out of either fraud or defalcation?       Perhaps so.     Where did they get it from? (Laughter.)       Well, the -- why are you giving away that it's not in the traditional sense? I think it's a loss in the traditional sense.     The trust was entitled to whatever profit was made from the use of its funds, right?       And he made a quarter million dollars that should have belonged to the trust. It's not enough to say, well -- you know, I'll pay you 2 percent interest or whatever the going rate of interest was.     He made $250,000 which should have been given to the trust.       That's not consistent with the original meaning of defalcation to which you were appealing.     It's pretty clear to me that the original meaning of -- is a cutting off, a failure to turn over money that was due.     So you -- are you appealing the original meaning or not?       You're saying defalcation just means breach of trust.     That's it.       And that's what made it a defalcation, no?       Well, so then you say there has to be a cutting off.     There has to be a loss, for defalcation.     Not just for -- for a debt, but also for the defalcation.       Why are you fighting that? You're going to have to prove the loss anyway.     You say there is a loss.       "Malversation."       Well, why not?     I mean, it's a -- it's a violation of the trustee's responsibility when he makes a negligent investment of the funds, right? And so he doesn't turn over as much money as should be turned over.     It's a defalcation.
11-1545 +++$+++        That -- that's no better. Louis Jaffe isn't even a member of the Court. (Laughter.)       Justice Breyer would replace that with a rule, where they like the agency to have authority, it has it, and, where they don't like it to have authority, it doesn't.     I'm not sure that's any better than --       -- a description of the Chevron --       I don't understand the question, to tell you the truth.     This matter is not left with the States.     It's going to be decided by a Federal instrumentality, right?     Either by the agency, which says, 30 days is the rule, or by Federal courts, which perhaps could issue opinions that say, 30 days is the rule. I mean, this -- you know, it's an interesting separation of powers question within the Federal government, but I don't see how it's a question of whether it's the States or the Federal government that's -- that's going to call the tune here.     It's going to be the Federal government, isn't it?       Don't -- don't you think that the --       Don't you -- don't you think that the issue of whether unelected Federal bureaucrats should decide it or unelected Federal judges should decide it is an issue of separation of powers, rather than an issue of -- of Federal/State relations?       Well, I -- I thought "reasonable" was what people were talking about as being ambiguous, although I think -- I don't think "ambiguous" is the proper word.     "Reasonable" is vague.     You don't know exactly what it means, right?       Mr. Verrilli, why isn't it an easy answer to the whole case to read (7)(A), except as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of State or local government?     Okay?     "Except as provided in this paragraph." And then later, in the paragraph, in the subsection entitled, "limitations," it says, "A State or local government shall act on any request for authorization within a reasonable period of time."       That's -- that's a limitation.
11-159 +++$+++        I don't -- I don't -- look, when Congress says "child," "child" means child, and the mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most children were indeed children of married people doesn't change the word "child."     I mean, we don't go back and say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what -- what their immediate concern is, and here they used the word "child."       You want us to probe their mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children were children of married people, that's what they must have meant by "child."     I just don't think that follows at all.     "Child" means child.       Oh, it disfavors children who are born after the father has died, which is in accord with the title of the statute:     survivors benefits.       What's issue here -- what's at issue here is not whether children that have been born through artificial insemination get benefits.     It's whether children who are born after the father's death get -- get benefits.       I haven't found the sentence you're talking about.     Where is it?       Bottom of what?     Page what?       Mr. --       Mr. Rothfeld, I know that the Government didn't rely on it, but just to satisfy my curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency upon the father?       I understand.     But --       -- that is connected with this other issue.
11-161 +++$+++        Because you would -- you would eliminate all litigation on Equal Protection Clause grounds if all that the plaintiff is going to achieve is not any benefit to him but harming somebody else. That's -- the classic case is -- is the sex discrimination case, where a State had a drinking law which said that -- that men could drink at the age of 18 but women at the age of 21.     And what happened in the lawsuit?     Did the court say, well, I guess -- I guess men will be able to drink at 18.     No, that's -       They said men would have to drink at 18, not that women will have to wait to 21 because -       But here -- here the State has defined the class.     That's the difference.     I mean, to say employers with less than eight is a separate class, that's fine.     But -- but here, the State said we're creating this class of -- of people who have to pay for sewer assessments, and we're going to treat them equally.     That's what the law required.       So, you're saying that any future law which -- which disregards an equal classification that a prior law established is okay?     So long as it's a future law that does it.       There will always be a future law that does it.       Yes.       That's what we're questioning.       I don't understand that. Why?     I mean, people paid the lump sum.       If people come forward and say I'm one of the ones who paid the lump sum, I want a refund; and if somebody doesn't come and present such a claim, the city doesn't pay.     If someone does -       Surely, the city has records.
11-166 +++$+++        They tried and failed to prove what?       Cause.       I lost you.     I lost you.       It's not just the requirements, but the exceptions to the requirements. What are you referring to?       Big case for the government, Ms. Harrington, isn't it?       It is a big case for the government.
11-182 +++$+++        Well, all that means -- it gives authority over naturalization, which we've expanded to immigration.     But all that means is that the government can set forth the rules concerning who belongs in this country.     But if, in fact, somebody who does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona has -- has no power?     What -- what does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?       But it's still up to the national government.     Arizona is not trying to kick out anybody that the Federal government has not already said do not belong here.     And the Constitution provides -- even -- even with respect to the Commerce Clause -- "No state shall without the consent of Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except," it says, "what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws." The Constitution recognizes that there is such a thing as state borders, and the states can police their borders, even to -- to the point of inspecting incoming shipments to exclude diseased material.       Do you have any example where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of preempting state action?       I'm talking about another -- another case of ours where we've said that, essentially, the preemption of state law can occur, not by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing it vigorously. Do we have any case that says that?       Well, they do that with all -- with all Federal criminal statutes.     And you acknowledge that, as a general matter, states can enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted to the Attorney General.       Sounds like racial profiling to me.       What does this have to do with Federal immigration law?     I mean, it may have to do with -- with racial harassment, but I thought you weren't relying on that.       Are you objecting to harassing the -- the people who have no business being here?     Is that -- surely, you're -- you're not concerned about harassing them.     They have been stopped anyway, and all you're doing is calling up to see if they are illegal immigrants or not. So you must be talking about other people who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration laws.     Okay?     Citizens and -- and other people, right?       But that has nothing to do with the immigration law --       -- which is -- which is what you're asserting preempts all of this activity.       Anyway, what -- what's wrong about the states enforcing Federal law?     There is a Federal law against robbing Federal banks.     Can it be made a state crime to rob those banks?     I think it is.       But does the Attorney General come in and say, you know, we might really only want to go after the professional bank robbers?     If it's just an amateur bank robber, you know, we're -- we're going to let it go.     And the state's interfering with our -- with our whole scheme here because it's prosecuting all these bank robbers.       Now, would anybody listen to that argument?       Of course not.       Well, maybe 1306(a) ought to be amended, then.     I mean, we have statutes out there that there a lot of people in violation of it and -- well, the Attorney General will take care of it.     Is that how we write our criminal laws?       Again, I ask you, do you have any other case in which the basis for preemption has been you are interfering with -- with the Attorney General's enforcement discretion?       I think that's an extraordinary basis for saying that the state is preempted.       It's not criminalizing anything that isn't criminal under Federal law.       It's -- it's the bank. It's the Federal bank example --       -- a state law, which criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does.       You said that in your brief, didn't you?       General, didn't you say in your brief -- I forget where it was -- I thought you said that the Justice Department doesn't get nearly enough money to enforce our immigration laws?     Didn't you say that?       Exactly.     Okay.     So the state says, well, that may be your priorities, but most of these people that you're not going after -- or an inordinate percentage of them, are here in our state, and we don't like it.     They are causing all sorts of problems.     So we're going to help you enforce Federal law.     We're not going to do anything else.     We're just enforcing Federal law.       Can't you avoid that particular foreign relations problem by simply deporting these people?     Free them from the jails --       And send them back to the countries that are -- that are objecting.       What's the problem with that?       So we -- we have to -- we have to enforce our laws in a manner that will please Mexico?     Is that what you're saying?       It sounded like what you were saying.       -- think field preemption; is that your argument with respect to this section?
11-184 +++$+++ 
11-192 +++$+++        Well, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't need the Tucker Act now, would you?       Just sue under the statute.       So are you splitting your claim?     I mean, if you have both a cause of action under FCRA and under the Tucker Act, the one has to go to the Federal Circuit and the other elsewhere, or the Court of Claims and then the Federal Circuit?     What do you do?       You also claimed under FCRA, under the statute, right?       Okay.       Do you know any other statutes offhand -- I can't think of any, but maybe you know some -- in which you can get money out of the United States but don't have to go through the Court of Claims and the Federal circuit?     What other statutes are there?     And if there are none, the reason I ask the question, it becomes less and less plausible that FCRA was meant to allow suit against the Federal Government.       For money damages.       For the same reason that you have the principle of sovereign immunity.     They're -- they are perfectly willing to subject corporations to immense liability, but they are not willing to subject the Federal Government to immense liability.     That's what the doctrine of sovereign immunity is all about, isn't it?       I -- I really have -- I haven't followed this argument.     You say (l) --       -- shows that they had liability by the Government in mind?       I mean, why anybody -- notwithstanding any other provision, the remedies and sanctions set forth in this section shall be the only judicial remedies and sanctions for violation of this section.       Why -- why does that bear upon whether the United States is liable or not?       I see.       Well, if you are right about that, I guess we could write a very narrow opinion saying the Tucker Act applies where there is a cause of action under the original statute anyway, in which case we would not have made much new law, would we?       Yes.       The Government doesn't concede that you have a cause of action under FCRA at all.       They say -- they say just the opposite.     And so what I find peculiar is that there should be two causes of action for the same thing.     You can proceed either under FCRA or under the Tucker Act or both.     I mean, that's very strange to me.     It seems to me, one or the other, and it would normally be the specific governing the general. So if you say there is one under FCRA, why do we need the Tucker Act?       Do you have any other case where -- where you -- somebody's been allowed to proceed under the Tucker Act where there is clear ability to proceed under some other statute?
11-199 +++$+++        Mr. Yang, why does any of this have to do with her credibility?     Did the dissent say that the way this affected the jury was that it rendered her less credible?     I thought --       -- that the dissent just said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer thought he was going to lose.
11-204 +++$+++        You wouldn't -- you wouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?       Yes.       But they've changed their -- their view.       Consignment, for one, which is legitimate business.       Mr. Clement, I wanted to ask you about section 501 of the regulations, which -- which is on page 4 of the appendix in the blue brief, and was mentioned in the -- in the Government's presentation.     It says -- requires that the employee be engaged in (i) making sales within the meaning of 3(k); or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities. What authorization is there for the agency to invent number (ii)?
11-210 +++$+++        Well, sometimes the harm is just the impairment of governmental purposes, such as section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false statement to any Federal agent, for Pete's sake.     How do you justify that?     Because the making of the false statement impairs a governmental investigation.     And what is being urged here is that the making of this type of a false statement impairs the government's ability to honor valorous members of the armed forces.       And do we give some deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to governmental purposes, or do we make it up ourselves? When Congress passed this legislation, I assume it did so because it thought that the value of the awards that these courageous members of the armed forces were receiving was being demeaned and diminished.       By charlatans.     That's what Congress thought.       Is that utterly unreasonable that we can't accept it?       The government is going to hire people to follow, you know -- is that realistic?       I mean, there is a sanction.     You know, when there's a sanction in place, you think twice before you tell the lie.     But if there's no sanction except you might be exposed, who's going to expose you?     That sanction already exists, and there are a lot of people nonetheless who tell the lie.     You really expect the government to hire investigators to go around the country outing people who falsely claim military honors?       That's not going to happen.       I think that would be a good idea.       Something of value.     It has to be something of commercial value, right?     It's - doing it just to -- just to obtain praise and the higher esteem of your fellow citizens, that's -- that's not enough.       You have to get a penny out of it, right?       What if he just gets the cheers of the crowd?     He's up there.     I'm a congressional Medal of -- the crowd cheers, and they give him a parade down Main Street.     Is -- is that something of value?
11-246 +++$+++        You -- you say the 30-day window only applies to quiet title actions.       Surely -- surely the 30-day envisions comments by anybody, not just people who claim to own the property, doesn't it?       I thought that -- maybe I'm wrong, but the government will correct me if I am.     I thought the government concedes that a NEPA action could -- could be brought when the government is taking land to use for a particular use.     Let's say it's -- it's taking land for a nuclear waste repository. Certainly, a NEPA action would -- would lie.     You don't disagree with that, do you?       You're supposed to say "yes, sir, good." (Laughter.)       You're not -- you're answering the question with regard to an argument I don't think you've made and I don't think you would want to make.     You're not asserting that the action can be brought anytime within 6 years after the government has already taken the land.     You're just asserting that an action brought before the government takes the land does not change its character and become a quiet title action afterwards; right?       You're not saying that anybody can bring within 6 years after the government's taking a suit, are you?     I hope you're not arguing that.       Thank you. (Laughter.)       I think you're right.     I pushed you into it.     It's my fault.     You're right.       Of course, the government can fix that.     I mean, if this is indeed an inconvenient situation, that we think the government should not be in doubt for 6 years afterwards, I guess Congress can simply change it; right?       Totally within the control of Congress.     We -- we -- we don't have to make up some limitation to protect -- to protect the United States.       Yes.       What -- what about this as a reason?     When you prevail in a quiet title action, the only way the government can get off the hook is to give you the land, if it's -- if it's within, what, the 6 years, or pay you money if it's after 6 years, but within 12.     Whereas in your case, I suppose the government could moot the suit -- moot the suit, by simply disallowing gambling. Can the government do that?       Once it has told the tribe that they can have -- I mean, this suit could be -- could go away so long as the tribe does not run a casino; isn't that right?     That's your -- that's the gravamen of your complaint.       So I guess you -- you could be a happy fellow if -- so long as the tribe doesn't build a casino.     Whereas in -- in quiet title cases, the only way you can make a happy fellow out of the plaintiff is to give him the land.
11-262 +++$+++        That's an assault, isn't it?       All it takes for an assault is an unwanted touching.       It's not incidental if you reach out and touch somebody on the shoulder or the arm.       That's fine, and he didn't -- he doubtless didn't consider those contacts hostile. But when somebody tells you "I think your policies are disgusting" --       I mean, just don't tell me that it's -- it's not a crime.     It is an assault if it's an unwanted touching.       And it wouldn't be a violation of the First Amendment if they only did that because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing?       Wouldn't that be a violation of the First Amendment?       Even though they're doing it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be okay?       Of course not.     I don't see how your -- your First Amendment exception doesn't apply to those things as well as to --       -- to the arrest.       It's not a conclusion.     I mean, if -- if he didn't have the bumper sticker and you asserted in the pleading he stopped me because he knows I hate the police, that's a conclusion.     But if you have the bumper sticker, he says, you know, I had the bumper sticker, and that's why he stopped me.       Again, I don't understand why you -- why you say that they're immune from the charge of First Amendment retaliation for that but not immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean --       If you say they're doing it on First Amendment grounds for the one, they're doing it on the First Amendment grounds for the other.     Why is either one okay?       Well, we lost a couple of Presidents, didn't we? (Laughter.)
11-338 +++$+++        What do you mean, "active"? What does that mean?       They -- they cut maybe, what, every -- every 10 years?     Is that active?       What about the 9 years in-between?     Are they being actively used?       I'm looking at page 7, and it doesn't say the authority to designate additional roads.     It says additional stormwater discharges.       That could be stormwater discharges that have nothing to do with logging.       Yes, they -- they are just intervening.     It's -- it's not like what happens in the -- in the suits for fraud against the government, where they take over the litigation.       They don't take it over. They just intervene.
11-345 +++$+++        Do they have to self-identify?       And how do they decide? You know, it's -- they want not just a critical mass in the school at large, but class by class?     How do they figure out that particular classes don't have enough? What -- are they -- somebody walks in the room and looks them over to see who looks -- who looks Asian, who looks black, who looks Hispanic?     Is that -- is that how it's done?       I don't know what you are talking about.     I mean, it is either a factor that is validly in this case or it isn't.     Now, do they look to individual classroom diversity or not?     And if so, how do they decide when classes are diverse?       Fine.     I'm asking how.     How did they look to the classroom?       On their way in -- did they require everybody to check a box or they have somebody figure out, oh, this person looks 1/32nd Hispanic, and that's enough?       What kind of a study?     What kind of a study?       Yes.     It doesn't explain to me how they go about, classroom by classroom, deciding how many minorities there are.       I don't understand that. Why?     Why -- why doesn't it?       What kind of viewpoints?     I mean, are they political viewpoints?       This -- this has nothing to do with, with racial diversity.     I mean, you're talking about something else.       Also, the kind that is likely to be included within the 10 percent rule.     And, incidentally, when -- when was the 10 percent rule adopted?       But that -- that -- that holds for only -- only another what, 16 years, right? Sixteen more years, and you're going to call it all off.       But you're appealing to Grutter, and that's what it said.       Some of the stuff that Grutter says -- some of the stuff that Grutter says you agree with, some of the stuff that it says you don't agree with.       Well, that's part of the injury she suffered.     It's -- it's not the only injury perhaps.       But she -- she had to pay an admissions fee for a process in which she was not treated fairly.       Why shouldn't she get her money back?       Since we are asking questions about just curiosity, I am curious to know how many -- this is a very ambitious racial program here at the University of Texas.     How many people are there in the affirmative action department of the University of Texas?     Do you have any idea?     I mean, there must be a lot of people to, you know, to monitor all these classes and do all of this assessment of race throughout the thing.     There would be a large number of people be out of a job, wouldn't we, wouldn't they, if we suddenly went to just 10 percent?       How many people?       You don't.       Yes, but -- but the hypothetical is that the two applicants are entirely the same in all other respects.       And if -- if the ability to give a racial preference means anything at all, it certainly has to mean that, in the -- in the hypothetical given -- given by Justice Alito, the minority student gets in and the other one doesn't.       It's not a matter of not everyone; it's a matter of two who are identical in all other respects.       And what does the racial preference mean if it doesn't mean that in that situation the minority applicant wins and the other one loses?       But, they're already talking --       We should probably stop calling it critical mass then, because mass, you know, assumes numbers, either in size or a certain weight.       So we should stop calling it mass.       Call it a cloud or something like that. (Laughter.)
11-393 +++$+++        Mr. Kneedler, there are some provisions which nobody would have standing to challenge.     If the provision is simply an expenditure of Federal money, it doesn't hurt anybody except the taxpayer, but the taxpayer doesn't have standing.     That -- that just continues.     Even though it is -- it should -- it is so closely allied to what's been struck down that it ought to go as well.     But, nonetheless, that has to continue because there's nobody in the world that can challenge it. Can that possibly be the law?       But those are provisions that have been legitimately enacted.     The whole issue here is whether these related provisions have been legitimately enacted or whether they are so closely allied to one that has been held to be unconstitutional that they also have not been legitimately enacted. You can't compare that to -- to cases dealing with a statute that nobody denies is -- is constitutional.       Mr. Kneedler --       -- don't you think it's unrealistic to say leave it to Congress, as though you're sending it back to Congress for Congress to consider it dispassionately, on balance, should we have this provision or should we not have provision?     That's not what it's going to be.     It's going to be these provisions are in effect, even though you -- a lot of you never wanted them to be in effect and you only voted for them because you wanted to get the heart of the -- of the Act, which has now been cut out.     But, nonetheless, these provisions are the law, and you have to get the votes to overturn them. That's an enormously different question from whether you get the votes initially to put them into the law. What -- there is no way that this Court's decision is not going to distort the congressional process.     Whether we strike it all down or leave some of it in place, the congressional process will never be the same.     One way or another, Congress is going to have to reconsider this.     And why isn't it better to have them reconsider it -- what should I say -- in toto, rather than having some things already in the law which you have to eliminate before you can move on to consider everything on balance?       Is this not totally unrealistic, that we're going to go through this enormous bill item by item and decide each one?       I don't care whether it's easy for my clerks.     I care whether it's easy for me. (Laughter.)       Mr. Kneedler, could I -- can you give us a prior case in -- that resembles this one in which we are asked to strike down what the other side says is the heart of the Act, and yet leave in -- as you request, leave in effect the rest of it?     Have we ever -- most of our severability cases, you know, involve one little aspect of the Act, and the question is whether the rest.     When have we ever really struck down what was the main purpose of the Act and left the rest in effect?     Do you have a case for that?       I think the reason -- the reason the majority said that was that they didn't think that what was essential to the Act was what had been stricken down, and that is the -- the ability of the judge to say on his own what -- what the punishment would be.     I don't think that's a case where we struck -- where we excised the heart of the statute. You have another one?       There is no example.     This is really --       Is this really a case of first impression?       I don't know another case where we have been confronted with this -- with this decision. Can you take out the heart of the Act and leave everything else in place?       Have a conference committee report afterwards, maybe. (Laughter.)       Anticipation of the minimum coverage.     That's going to bankrupt the insurance companies, if not the States, unless this minimum coverage provision comes into effect.       But many people might not -- many of the people in Congress might not have voted for those provisions if the central part of this statute was not adopted.       I mean, you know, you're -- to say that we're effectuating the intent of Congress is just unrealistic.     Once you've cut the guts out of it, who knows, who knows which of them were really desired by Congress on their own and which ones weren't?       Excuse me.     Why do you say -- I didn't follow that.     Why?       Why would their rates be lower?       There is nothing about Federal support that is unsustainable, right?     That is infinite. (Laughter.)       Is there any dictionary that gives that --       Just give me one dictionary.       How do we know that?     When people speak, I assume they're speaking English.       Mr. Farr, let's consider how -- how your approach, severing as little as possible, thereby increases the deference that we're showing to Congress.     It seems to me it puts Congress in this position:     This Act is still in full effect.     There is going to be this deficit that used to be made up by the mandatory coverage provision.     All that money has to come from somewhere.     You can't repeal the rest of the Act because you're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal the rest.     It's not a matter of enacting a new Act.     You got to get 60 votes to repeal it.     So, the rest of the Act is going to be the law. So, you're just put to the choice of, I guess, bankrupting insurance companies and the whole system comes tumbling down, or else enacting a Federal subsidy program to the insurance companies, which is what the insurance companies would like, I'm sure. Do you really think that that is somehow showing deference to Congress and respecting the democratic process? It seems to me it's a gross distortion of it.       No, I -- that wouldn't be my approach.     My approach would say, if you take the heart out of the statute, the statute's gone.     That enables Congress to do what it wants in the usual fashion.     And it doesn't inject us into the process of saying:     This is good, this is bad, this is good, this is bad.       It seems to me it reduces our options the most and increases Congress's the most.       Why put -- why put Congress to that false choice?       You know -- you only have two choices, Congress.     You can have the whole bill or you can have -- you can have parts of the bill or no bill at all.     Why that false choice?
11-45 +++$+++        Well, I will object.     What is the agency -- taking evidence on an issue that it has no jurisdiction to decide?     That is absolutely weird. (Laughter.)       I don't like that at all. That's ridiculous.     Send it back to an agency that has no jurisdiction over the question, you know, make factfindings on this -- on this question over which you have no jurisdiction. Can you give any example where -- where that occurs elsewhere?     Why wouldn't the -- the preferable course be to appoint a master, have the Federal Circuit appoint a master to do it?       Yes, but -- but this is not an area that's within their expertise to decide.     What do they know about -- about the military?     And when is that ever -- ever relevant to anything that they decide? It's utterly irrelevant to their work.     And you're telling them to take --       Wait.     You're -- you're actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions that the agency has no authority to decide?       If you don't bring before the agency a question that the agency says it has no authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability?
11-460 +++$+++        So -- so -- so what follows from that; that the district is liable because it's a lousy permit?       I do not see how this court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to be able to do anything different, other than say there's no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is something I worry about.       I -- I agree with that, but how can this permit possibly be interpreted in such a way as to hold a district liable?       They would assume that; but, if it doesn't, it doesn't.       So what do you do if it doesn't?       They have -- they have not agreed.       So you're going to impose a shared thing?     I see no way for the court of appeals to do this in -- in a fashion that will not bring the case right back here, and you'll be asking us to send it back to the same panel.       But that is not our ordinary practice, when -- when nothing can happen on remand, except -- except to give judgment for the Petitioners here.       Wait.     But -- but before you go further, it says each permittee must comply.     It doesn't say that each permittee shall be responsible or shall be liable.     And it's the other provision that says that each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for which it is the operator.   Correct. So you got more -- Yes, You Honor. -- more besides 195.       Of course, the very first step is A, "Upon a determination by either the permittee or the regional board that discharges are causing or contributing to an exceedance of an applicable water quality standard, the permittee shall promptly notify," et cetera.     They cannot make such a determination because of the nature of the monitoring -- monitoring here.       What's the third section, Mr. Colangelo?     I'm waiting breathlessly for your third section.     You said there were three. (Laughter.)       I've got 195.     I've got 98. Where is the third one?       109.       Well, why -- why do you need that if -- if the present permit covers it as clearly as you say?     I mean self -- self-monitoring.       My goodness, you're going to go through all of this how many -- how long did it take you to challenge this and blah, blah, blah, blah? Why go through all that if, indeed, the present permit, as you say, is perfectly adequate?       Mr. Colangelo, did you raise this argument in your brief in opposition?       Where is it in that?     I was looking for it.       But that --     That may be, but you don't support -- and page what?       But you don't --       -- you don't say that that's the basis for supporting the decision below.     I certainly didn't interpret it.       I don't have your supplemental brief in front of me.       Well -- but -- but that -- that's just to say you can rely on -- on the extant monitors.       So you say -- you know, they were correct.     You have to find some basis for liability, and they use the monitors, and that's it.     It didn't -- it didn't say, in detail, that these people had to go and -- and set up their own monitoring under -- under the permit.       You -- you told this to the Ninth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit said no?       Finish that.     So what's the consequence of that?       Therefore, each one of them is liable for all of it?       But they haven't done so. So what?       I don't understand why you didn't cross-appeal on -- on this theory that -- that the lower court rejected.       I didn't say you need to. I didn't say you needed to.     But I -- I would normally have done it, just to be sure I had that arrow in my quiver and that it would not be argued, as it will be here, that this would be expanding the judgment below.       What if this panel found found for you on the ground that they used, they will surely find for you on this other ground, which -- (Laughter.)       -- which has at least an inkling of plausibility.
11-465 +++$+++ 
11-551 +++$+++        I wish you would.     I've lost the question. (Laughter.)      Ferris did not say, as I recall, that you can't expect the contractor to have notice that appropriations have been limited.    It said you can't expect them to have notice as to how much of the expenditures under that appropriated act have been spent.     Isn't that the only thing it required notice of?       I would think, if you sign a contract, you better be sure that there are appropriations for it.       Well, am I correct that what the government is arguing is that the fact that this limitation was included in the particular contract makes it different from Ferris?       Which Ferris did not.     Did the Ferris contract say that?       Well, is it --       Well, is it just a question of our creating a new rule, or rather, is the proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into this, should have realized that because of the peculiarity of these contracts that they had to be entered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply does not apply?     It ought to be a question of expectation of the tribe, should it not?       Do you think it protects these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue?       Does that make their situation better somehow?       Do you have to solve it contract by contract?     Couldn't there be a -- a provision in the -- in the law which -- which says that, where appropriated funds are inadequate to cover the totality of -- of costs under this statute, it will be apportioned as follows?       Or the Secretary will apportion it?     That's all it would take.     You wouldn't even have to do it contract by contract.     Right?       You would prefer contract by contract for your clients.       Oh, absolutely --
11-556 +++$+++        We didn't take this case to -- to decide those factual questions.       We really didn't.     We took it principally to decide whether the Seventh Circuit rule was -- was right or not.     And you don't even defend that.     So there is nobody here defending the Seventh Circuit.       They are not talking to us here, are they?       What does that have to do with agency?     That's what I don't understand.     Why -- why do any of these tests have to do with agency?       I mean, I can understand Congress writing a statute that says -- you know, any -- any person given -- given authority by the employer, which authority is used to make it more difficult for a person to complain about racial or sexual harassment, is bad.     But the statute doesn't say that.     It says apply agency principles. How does agency have anything to do with the line you're arguing that we take here?       Then why not leave it there?     If that's what the agency is --       -- then you don't need it at all.     So the music -- the music would -- the thermostat would qualify.     It would all qualify.       Why?     Why?     I mean, if that's your principle, apply the principle.       If you are aided -- you know, you're going to work in a cold room unless you -- you know, comply with my sexual advances, apply the principle.     What's so hard about that?     That's a clear line.
11-564 +++$+++        Suppose you -- you have someone who, who has been guilty of a crime.     He has -- he has the body.     He has committed a murder and he has the body in the home.     He certainly wants to keep that private, right?     And he foolishly and mistakenly leaves the blinds open in the room where -- where the corpse is lying, and the policeman at a great distance has a telescope and he looks through the blinds and he sees the corpse.     Can the police go into the home?       Oh -- he hasn't knowingly. He was careless.       He certainly wanted to keep it -- he wanted to keep it private.       Well, you could say the same thing here.     They wanted to keep private the fact that they were growing the marijuana, but they -- they used a means of suppressing the heat that made it impossible to keep it private.       They were careless.       There were the mothballs.       But, Mr. Blumberg, I think you're, with respect, misguided to concede that if it was just the officer alone without the dog, it would be perfectly okay.       Well, I thought you did.       And I would assume you would say that if the officer walks up there with no intention to knock and talk, but just walks up to the door with the intention of sniffing at the door, you would consider that to be a violation, wouldn't you?       All right.     Again, I think you're wrong not to accept that.     I think our cases support it.     I think you cannot enter the protected portion of a home, which is called the curtilage, with the intention of conducting a search, that that is not permitted.     I think our cases establish that.       And it's fine to say -- I don't think it's true that the intent of the officer is never relevant.     It is relevant in that context. The reason for the officer going onto protected property, if he's going on just to knock on the door to sell tickets to the Policeman's Ball, that's fine.     If he's going on to conduct a search, that's something else.       But you do say that this is an easier case.       It's not the sidewalk here, is it?     It's the front part.       There's -- there's an implied license to -- to go on to the curtilage for most people.       The curtilage is -- is not sacrosanct.       Yes.
11-5683 +++$+++        I would find that extraordinary, that they say it's racist, but we're going to leave in effect all of the sentences that have previously been -- been imposed.     That seems to me very unlikely. Mr. Estrada, I would like you to explain the effect of 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii), which -- which does seem to -- to be sure, it's not in the new legislation, but it's the background against which the new legislation was adopted, and it seems to require that -- that the court use the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing.
11-597 +++$+++        I don't -- I don't understand what you're saying.     Are you saying that if this landowner owned land behind the dam that was temporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that that would be a taking?       No, I didn't think you were saying that.       A foreseeable and certain incidental consequence.       Well, no, not necessarily. Suppose there -- because of a spring melt-off or other factors, it's clear that the reservoir for several months of the year will be more extensive than it will the rest of the year.       So you could say, just -- just as here, that there's only been a temporary taking of some of the land behind the reservoir. Now, doesn't the -- doesn't the Government condemn all the land --       -- even that which would be only temporarily flooded?       Of course, that can't overrule the Takings Clause, can it?       I mean, that's nice that Congress doesn't want to be liable. (Laughter.)       I mean, the issue is who is going to pay for that wonderful benefit to these farmers.     Should it be everybody, so that the Government pays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it be this -- this particular sorry landowner who happens to lose all his trees?       That doesn't seem to me particularly fair.       I don't think -- one of those risks has to be the Government's going to make you pay for protecting somebody else. Is that one of the risks?       I doubt that.       Not flooding that time of year.     That's the problem.     I mean -- yes, flooding at a time when it wouldn't harm the trees.       You -- you would say that even -- even if this land was permanently flooded, okay, permanently flooded so he couldn't use it at all, since it was downstream, no harm done, right?       But that's your position.       Yes, but he loses because the Corps comes in and says, yes, indeed, we did flood , but, in order to save, you know, 1 and 3 through 10. Right?     And -- and he'd lose.       Okay.     It's not arbitrary.
11-626 +++$+++ 
11-681 +++$+++    I don't understand what you're saying. If there were no union, there would be no wages?   So from -- from the outset, it set up the union, right, and the union said, We want 7 bucks an hour, was that it?   And who picked that number?   The State did. Okay.   Of course, one can be skeptical about whether -- when States do this, they are doing it because it's more -- more efficient as an employer because some States have tried to force private employers to have a closed shop, haven't they?   And there's no -- you know, no State government interest in it. There's just State interest in unions.   And unions getting a lot of money from people who don't belong in the unions. So one can be skeptical about whether this is really what's going on, that the State really thinks it's going to be a lot easier if it has a closed shop.   They may do so because of that reason. You don't know what their reason is any more than I do. All you can say is that that might be their reason.
11-697 +++$+++ 
11-702 +++$+++        Counsel, I thought that when Congress enacted this provision, there was not the distinction between elements and sentencing factors that we now have, that the statute was enacted, in other words, before Apprendi.       That may be, but it certainly goes to your argument that Congress had in mind some distinction between elements and sentencing factors.
11-713 +++$+++        It's not just discretion. It's political discretion.     That's what's troublesome about it.     And you -- it seems to me the Government makes -- takes an absolutist approach to the proposition that you cannot use an un-precleared plan for any purpose.     All the law says is that you cannot apply a precleared plan.     The plan being applied here is not the Texas legislature's plan; it's the plan -- a remedial plan adopted by Federal judges. And to say that they cannot use in drawing up that plan the legislature's last political decisions seems to me not required by the mere prohibition against implementing that plan as the plan of the legislature. What would you do if -- if the district court in Washington and the district court in Texas -- neither one of them acts in time, and it's too late? It's too late to have any -- any primaries anymore. What -- what would happen?       What would happen?     You can't use the old plan.     You have this absolute rule against using the new plan.     What happens?     You disenfranchise every voter in Texas --       -- because there may be some voters in Texas, may be, some who will be prejudiced by using the current plan?     I suggest in that situation there's nothing to do but use the Texas plan.       You acknowledge that there are some situations in which you can use the very plan that the Texas legislature adopted, even though it's not been precleared?       So, it's no longer an absolute rule.     So, the question is whether this is another reasonable exception to a non-absolute rule.       Exclude me from the second. I'm not sure that -- that I've gone along on that, as you phrased it.     The way you phrase it, you say they cannot even make the kind of preliminary inquiry that -- that your friend suggests.       But that is not the current State policy.     The benchmark plan is gone.     It's old. The Texas legislature now has a different policy, and that, you say, should be ignored.       Now, what's -- there's a presumption of its invalidity.     You can't presume it valid, but you can presume it invalid.       Well, not either way. You're presuming it invalid.       Drawn as?     Drawn as --       -- a coalition?       All right.       One of -- one of the basic rules that -- that was followed in drawing up the court plan was not to divide any voting districts, right?       Why?     Why did the -- that certainly is not a principle that the Texas legislature agrees with.       So, the court just made it up?       Go back from June 26th. Where does -- where does that leave us?       June, May, April.     It's the end of March.     Right?       And when do you expect the D.C. court to finish?
11-770 +++$+++        The threat is from anybody coming back to the house, not just the person who just left.       And surely the police, when they're conducting a search, post guards to prevent people from coming in.       I assume they always do. It seems to me there's no special threat from the person who -- who left the house.     There's always a threat of somebody else coming into the house.       If -- if you have a large enough force that you can afford to send two of them in a car chasing this fellow for a mile, why can't you just post those two outside the house, just in case somebody, whether it's this person who's just left or anybody else, comes back?     I mean, it -- it seems to me that -- that what your positing is -- is -- is unlikely, namely, having -- having sufficient personnel to follow these persons, but not having sufficient personnel to defend the premises against somebody entering.       There is something magical about the gate or at least about the immediate facility of the house.     What we're trying to apply here is an absolute rule to make it unnecessary for the officers to guess whether they can do this or that.     And the rule you propose is, well, you know, a mile away.     What's your test, a reasonable --       As soon as reasonably practicable.     You consider that an absolute test?     I thought that the test we invented here was meant to help officers, to say this is the rule and you can do it. And you want to do anything else, use Terry or use -- use normal probable cause principles, but this is an absolute rule governing the -- the search of a home.       It doesn't give you a where.     You need more than a who.     You need a who and a where.       So what?     What's he going to -- he's going to phone them and say, hey, you know, you're going to be searched.     The cops are crawling all around the house already. So the only realistic additional threat is that he is going to voluntarily go back to where the police are in the house?     I mean, you know --       -- this is so implausible. What -- what harm --       -- what threat to the policemen can possibly exist?       Very unusual.       Very unusual.       You don't adopt absolute rules to cover foolhardy people.     I mean, we -- absolute rules are designed to cover the mine run of cases, the generality of cases, not the oddball case.     That's not what you use an absolute rule for.       The -- the procedure has to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, right?     Now -- now, the requirements for a warrant are not the outer bounds of -- of what's reasonable, but nonetheless, what -- it seems to me that what's reasonable under the Fourth Amendment can be estimated from what the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant to contain, and what a warrant must contain is a description of the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. And what you're arguing for is a special rule which says once you have a warrant that this place can be searched, you can seize anybody -- you can seize not only anybody there in order to protect the police, but anybody connected with the -- with the place.     And that -- that is so contrary to what -- what seems to me the theory of -- of the Fourth Amendment that I am very reluctant to -- to extend our cases any further than they already exist.       He might have wanted to help in the search.       All law enforcement would be a lot easier if we didn't have the doggone Fourth Amendment.     I mean, the Fourth Amendment is an impediment to law enforcement.     Of course it is. There -- there's no doubt about that.
11-796 +++$+++        That's a pretty horrible result, but let me give you another horrible result, and that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be able to do a second planting by simply getting the undifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator because at least a few of those seeds will always be patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use it for second plantings where the risks are so high that it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed.     Now they can't do that anymore because there's practically no grain elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in it.       -- and that's why farmers want to use it, for a cheap planting.       Sure, sure, I understand.       What do you mean you can do it once?     I don't know what you --       One shot of a gun.       You can't rob a bank with it, though, right? (Laughter.)
11-798 +++$+++        What exception do you appeal to?     There are a number of exceptions there.       What exception are you appealing to from the -- from the preemption provision?       Well, that's a different point, but -- but you're -- you're talking about, you know, an exception for private contract operations as Page 31 opposed to public matters.       There are exceptions to the preemption and that is not one of them.     And other statutes do have exceptions for -- for commercial operations or private operations.     This one doesn't.       Do market participants impose civil and criminal penalties?       Ah.     Yes.       Is that how we decide these things?     When there is on the books a criminal penalty that can apply to everybody, do we let the State come in and say, oh, you know, no harm, no foul because it's on the books, but we -- we don't really use it.     Well, I don't know -- I don't know that we do that.     If it's there, it's a criminal penalty, and if -- if the Page 33 condition of -- of -- of you're being able to impose these limitations is that you not have criminal penalties, there is a criminal penalty.       Okay.       I'm not sure that's crucial.     You think a State can -- can say nobody's going to come on our highways until it signs a contract? Okay?     These highways belong to us, they are State land, and anybody who wants to ride on the highways, you have Page 37 to enter a contract with the State.     And that's going to get around this Federal statute?       Okay.     It's a highway only for trucks.     It's a truck highway.       Okay?     It's specially reinforced and everything, but you have to enter a contract with the State in order to drive your truck on this highway.     And that -- that's okay.       I know we're not.     That's why it's a hypothetical.       Okay.     The State makes money on this truck highway.     It's a money-maker, okay?       And that makes it okay?       It was -- it was implied preemption in Boston Harbor.     Here you have an express preemption clause which contains exceptions, and among those exceptions is not the running of a commercial enterprise, even though that is made an exception in a number of other Federal statutes -- Federal preemption statutes.     That's a very high hill for you to climb, relying solely on the fact that you are a commercial enterprise.       What -- what if they violate those conditions?     I mean, that's -- that's where the -- that's where the shoe pinches.     What if they violate those contractual conditions?     Then do you exclude only the truck that violates it, or do you exclude the whole trucking company?       What's the ultimate? What's the ultimate?     You've tried everything else and you whack them with a big penalty. What is that?       I've never heard of this doctrine.     This is a facial attack to a contract?     Is that it?     I mean, you --       We have to attack this contract provision by provision -- or application by application?
11-817 +++$+++        But what --       Now I thought the court said -- held against the state.     I thought what the Florida court was saying is that if you didn't produce it, the dog's evidence would -- would not be allowed -- it's --       -- the search is invalid.       Yes.       Even worse.       Is that a requirement too? That's a constitutional requirement, that the dog training doesn't count unless it's training with the officer who is using the dog?       Well, fine.     Counsel can bring that up.     Counsel can bring that up at the hearing before the judge.     But -- but I understood this to be a -- a requirement.     You never even get to that hearing, because there's no evidence that this dog was ever trained with this policeman.       Yes, and therefore end of case, right?       Well --       What -- what -- what are the -- what are the incentives here?     Why would a police department want to use an incompetent dog?     Is that any more likely than that a medical school would want to certify an incompetent doctor?     What -- what incentive is there for a police department?       And that's a good thing?       I mean, you acquire probable cause, you go in and there's nothing there. You've wasted the time of your police officers, you've wasted a lot of time.       Well, maybe the police department doesn't care about that, but it certainly cares about wasting the time of its police officers in fruitless searches.       Willy-nilly.     Officers just like to search.     They don't particularly want to search where they're likely to find something.     They just like to search.     So let's get dogs that, you know, smell drugs when there are no drugs.     You really think that that's what's going on here?       They like to search where they're likely to find something, and that only exists when the dog is well trained.     It seems to me they have every incentive to train the dog well.       Oh, I assure you that if we agree with you there will be a whole body of experts that will spring into being about dog training.     I assure you that that will be the case.       Yes, but -- but counsel, you're defending a Florida Supreme Court opinion which says "must."     You can't just say, you know, I'm not asserting any particular thing is necessary, just, you know, totality of the circumstances.     You have an opinion here in which the Florida Supreme Court says "must."     It must include the, you know, the field training.     Now, do -- do you disavow that or -- or do you want us the ignore it?     What?       If -- if this is absent in the totality of the circumstances and you nonetheless hold that there was probable cause, then "must" does not mean "must," right?       But they are likely to be found if there is a residual odor of drugs, even though the drugs are no longer there.     So it's not an incompetent dog when he alerts because of the residual odor.       But at least we don't have to worry about mothballs in this case; is that right? There are no mothballs? (Laughter.)
11-820 +++$+++        What's -- what's the sense of that?     Why -- why -- let's assume, you know, at the time the guilty plea or whatever occurred, it was not the professional norm, and then later the professional norms change and he makes the argument that -- that he's entitled to relief, and you say yes, because --       Is that what your opponent contends as well?
11-864 +++$+++        You're -- you are saying it's inadmissible if it's inadequately probative, right?       So the two questions boil down to the same, don't they?     If it's inadequately probative, it's inadmissible, isn't that right.       Well, whenever.       I'm talking about what -- what is the criterion for Daubert?       Is it adequately probative? If not, it's inadmissible, so.       Well, you want to say -       You say unreliable.     I say inadequately probative.     It's -- it is unreliable because it is inadequately probative.       There --       He didn't say what -- there -- there were four possibilities that he took into account, right, as to what the anticompetitive conduct was?       And as it turns out, only one of those was found to -- to be in the game.       That was the basis for the claims.       It was not the basis?     His was based only on the one that the court accepted? Where -- where in the record is -- is that?       You can't be agnostic about what the anticompetitive conduct is, if you are going to do -- if you're going to do an analysis of what are the consequences of the -- of the anticompetitive conduct, you have to know the anticompetitive conduct you are talking about.       Mr. --       Mr. Barnett, suppose - suppose we held that where -- where there's a bench trial, it doesn't make any difference what -- what -- whether the judge excludes the evidence under Daubert -- I never know how to say it.     Is it Daubert or Daubert? (Laughter.)       Yes, I think you're right. It doesn't make a dime's worth of difference whether the judge excludes it under -- under Daubert or proceeds to find it simply unreliable -- unreliable.     Suppose -- suppose we held that.     What -- what difference would it make in the world?       So the trial judge could say, yes, I have a Daubert motion, but -- but I'm going to defer that.     I'm just going to -- going to proceed to see whether this evidence is reliable.
11-88 +++$+++        I'm not sure that the immigration officials conduct a thorough investigation. I mean, is there a box on the immigration form, you know -- have you tortured people?     Yes/No. (Laughter.)       You know, I really don't think they investigate that at all.       You don't have to prove it's an intelligent statute, do you?     Maybe it's a stupid statute.     Is that possible?       Is it possible?       Is it possible that it's just -- that it's a stupid statute?       But they were thinking about that in 1797.     I mean, you're saying in the later statute --       They were a much more perceptive Congress in 17 --
11-889 +++$+++        When they -       When they take water from the main stream of the Red River, how do they know how much of that water is from Reach V?       They are -- they are entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V. Is everything that -- that comes into Texas in the main channel of the Red River water from Reach V?       Now what page are you looking at?       Yeah, okay.       Yeah, yeah, yeah.     I didn't know -       What -       Reach I.     Okay.       Where is this?     Where is this?     Where is this?       I -- I don't understand what you just said, "They're riparian States, so they don't track diversions."       Why does that follow?       Okay.       Okay.
11-8976 +++$+++        Did the government charge in the indictment that the conspiracy existed during this five-year period?  During the particular five-year period.   And if it did not have to, it would have been up to the defendant to say, the statute of limitations runs on my participation, right?       But it -- it didn't say the conspiracy only existed within that five-year period?       Well, let's assume it did. Would -- would -- let's say, in a burglary indictment -- let's say the burglary occurred seven years ago, and there is a five-year statute of limitations.     If the indictment just -- just accuses the individual of conducting a burglary seven years ago, is that -- is that indictment invalid?       So it's -- it's up to the defendant to say, no --       -- seven years is too long.       So I guess the issue here is whether the government's statement that the conspiracy existed within this five-year period causes that to be an element of the crime?       I wish I had -- we had the supervening indictment before us.     It's -- it's not in the Joint Appendix.       But it -- it's described in the Court of Appeals opinion as follows:     "According to the indictment in the district court and the evidence of the United States at trial, during the late 1980s and 1990s, appellants Rodney Moore, Kevin Gray, John Raynor, Calvin Smith, Timothy Handy, and Lionel Nunn, along with others, some of whom were also indicted, but tried separately, conspired to conduct and did conduct an ongoing drug distribution business in Washington." So apparently, according to that description, it -- it was not charged as a conspiracy during those five years.     It was just charged as a conspiracy.       That's right.     So it would have been up to the defendant to prove that the statute of limitations barred -- barred his conviction.       It's a jackalope, maybe.     I never heard of a rabbit-duck. (Laughter.)       Insanity.       Suppose this thing doesn't come up in the -- in the statute of limitations context. Suppose it comes up in the context of whether this defendant is liable for an act committed by the co-conspirators after he withdrew.     So it's the same issue of whether -- whether he withdrew or not, before the murder of somebody, okay? He said -- you know, before that occurred, I was out of the conspiracy.     What do our cases say about -- about proving it in that context?     Is the burden on the defendant?     Or is the burden on the prosecution?       I suppose he could present his defense in the alternative, I didn't belong to the conspiracy, and anyway, I withdrew.     I mean, he can make both of those points, can't he?
11-9307 +++$+++        I can -- I can also not imagine a lawyer who intentionally makes that decision. That -- that lawyer is a unicorn, I suppose. But I think there are a lot of lawyers who will not be as careful about finding all of the issues that they should bring to the court's attention, perhaps be unaware of a statute that they should have been aware of. If -- if we -- if we adopt the rule that's being urged by the Petitioner here, it does affect attorney behavior for the attorney to know that stuff that he -- he ought to know but doesn't know will -- will not be able to be patched up on appeal.       Well, more than that, Johnson stood on its head, did it not, not to decide the case the easy way, which was simply to say if it's clear on appeal, the rule applies. It could have said that.     The case would have been very easy.     It -- it instead avoided that by saying, oh, well, this is a very special case. Well, it wouldn't be a special case if -- if the argument presented by the Petitioner here were accepted.     I don't -- far from -- far from appearing that Johnson supports Petitioner's case, I think Johnson tends to undermine it.       Absolutely.     I mean, that -- that argument applies to whether the error was plain or not.     Apply the law as it is.  I agree that that was a bad footnote. way. I think you're -- you know... (Laughter.)       I joined Johnson, and maybe I have to repudiate it if it leads -- leads to that conclusion.       Oh, I didn't?     Oh, thank God. (Laughter.)       It didn't sound like me.     I believe in the slippery slope.     And we're proving that today, aren't we?
11-9335 +++$+++        What page?     What page?       I wonder who -- I wonder who that could have been. (Laughter.)       But is it the usual case that a judge, when faced with this decision, has before him a jury finding?     I -- that --       The Petitioner is asking these cases to be thrown out, even if there has been no jury finding.       And the judge says -- you know, I have to decide whether he brandished or not; I think he brandished.     But I -- you know, the Petitioner here wants to say, the judge cannot consider himself bound by a mandatory minimum.     It seems to me the unusual case in which you have a jury finding, that the judge must ignore in -- in -- he actually doesn't ignore it, he goes along with it. The jury may well be right, that it's impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that -- that the felon brandished a gun, but it's -- it -- it's quite easy to say that it's very likely he branded a gun -- brandished a gun, which is what the judge has to find.     So he -- he's not even ignoring the jury finding.       Mr. Dreeben, I think that history is wrong.     In fact, the way the country started, there was no judicial discretion.     There were simply fixed penalties for crimes.     If you stole a horse, you were guilty of a felony, and you would be hanged. That's where we started.       And I would think that the risk involved is whether, if we come out the way that the Petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will consider going back to -- to where we started from and simply saying, if you brandish, you get seven years, period, with no discretion in the judge. That, it seems to me, is the greater risk.       I'm sorry.     I didn't hear your last word.     Those would be?       It is so bad he wants to extend it. (Laughter.)
11-94 +++$+++        This was -- you're not arguing that this rule will apply only to fines against corporations?     It would also apply to individuals, right?       It's up to the judge to decide how many days or what the value was and so forth. Right?       So, the right to trial by jury to have that very important fact found does not exist, even for individuals?       Mr. Dreeben, let's talk about Tyler.     Tyler was not argued before this Court.       It's a one-page opinion. It's later described quite accurately as focusing not upon the amount of the fine, but rather upon a misdescription of pot ashes as pearl ashes, right?       That's right.       Quite so.       The jury did find it in Tyler, though, didn't it?     The question was submitted to the jury, wasn't it?       Why doesn't -- why doesn't that indicate what the historical practice was?       Did it -- as a matter of statutory construction, right?       Right.       You -- you don't think they believed in the Apprendi doctrine, either, right?       Might have helped if they had argument, right?       What about all of the 19th-century cases cited by Justice Thomas's concurrence in Apprendi?     Fine cases.       In which course -- in which courts did indeed require the amount of the fines to be found by the jury.       Massachusetts, right.       Was it an argued case, at least?       If it's varied and complicated, why should we -- assuming that it's ambiguous, why should we adopt the strange rule that the jury has to find the fact if you go to jail for 2 weeks, but doesn't have to find the fact if the amount of fines multiplied by number of days or by anything else will -- will make a pauper of you?     Why would we adopt such a strange rule?       Unless compelled to do -- to do so by a clear common law history?       What if the judge disagreed with the jury about whether there was even a violation?       No, no, no, no.     The jury finds a violation, but the judge thinks the jury got it wrong.       How does -- how does he pick the -- the number of days?     He flips a coin?       No, he finds, you know, they could have come out that way, but -- but they were wrong.       That's the whole problem. That is indeed the whole problem.       The judge doesn't have to find that this defendant beyond a reasonable doubt committed the violation on so many days.     The jury would.       The judge can simply say, well, you know, all in all, probably they did it -- probably.     More likely than not they did it so many days.     It's a big difference.       What if you call it a misdemeanor but -- but impose a very heavy fine?     It's still a misdemeanor?       And you don't have right to counsel.     Right?       So --       Yes.     I guess you don't need counsel on any suits against corporations, right?
11-9540 +++$+++        Maybe -- maybe they haven't argued it because there's some serious constitutional doubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime to engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of physical injury is constitutional.     That's such a vague standard, you go to prison for 30 years if you engage in conduct, quote, "that creates a serious risk of physical injury."     I'm not about to buy into that one.       It seems strange to me at all.     He hasn't been convicted of raping or having intercourse with somebody under -- under 14 or under 15.       He's only been convicted of having that with someone under 18.       Not everything the jury finds constitutes a conviction.     They have to find something that is an element of the charged offense.       If being -- being under 16 is not -- or 14, whatever it is, is not an element of the charged offense, I don't care what the jury finds.       Qui tacet consentire videtur.     Why don't you quote the maxim? (Laughter.)       He who remains silent appears to consent.       And then advise defendants who -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that they will know which crimes carry another 30 years. (Laughter.)
11-965 +++$+++        Mr. Russell, I'm still hung up on -- on why we have to confront a Federal constitutional question.     It doesn't seem to me that a State statute which says we want to exercise jurisdiction to the extent the Constitution permits -- I don't think that invites a Court to restructure standard State law and to say, we're -- we're not going to observe the corporate distinction. I guess you'd have to say we can hold the individual shareholders of a corporation liable because that might not violate the Constitution.     I don't think that when -- when California adopts this statute it means to change its -- its standard law regarding corporations, regarding individuals, and so forth. Why -- why should we assume that?       Mr. Russell, could I - does it not follow from -- from your argument that a Federal court should entertain a suit against the shareholders of a foreign corporation when that foreign corporation has sufficient contacts in California?       Why -       Why is it any less fair?       Don't the shareholders?       Don't the shareholders?       Well, I can't see a distinction.     And I think, if you stretch the California statute as far as you're stretching it, you -- you have to assume that California would exercise jurisdiction in that case -       -- if you're the Ninth Circuit.       I'm sorry.       If this is as -- as Justice Breyer and I seem to think, a question of State law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth Circuit could make such a significant holding on -- on California law without -- there is a certification procedure in California, isn't there?       So why -- why wouldn't they have asked the California Supreme Court whether - whether this jurisdiction statute was meant to alter corporate law or -- you know, tort law, or -- you know -- just imagine any change in law that would bear upon jurisdiction, and all those changes must be assumed to have happened. Couldn't -- couldn't they ask that?     Is that what this California jurisdictional statute means?       Is it too late to ask it now?       You think it should be billions of dollars, right?     We're talking about percentage, right?       So we've got to pick a dollar amount, rather than a percentage.
11-982 +++$+++        What -- what -- what's the consideration -- I used to teach contract law.     This is -- you know, you can just give a covenant like that?
11-9953 +++$+++        I -- I was going to ask you that question.     Opposing counsel said that it -- it wasn't primarily attorney's fees that's at issue here, but investigation costs.     That makes a difference to me because, if it's just attorney's fees, he could have gone ahead with one attorney, as far as I'm concerned.       I thought -- I thought the statement meant could not ethically or legally bring him to trial while he is insisting on his right to two counsel.       It would have been different if he had said, the devil with the second counsel, I want a -- I want a prompt trial.       Then you would have felt that, legally and ethically, you could proceed.       His -- his one counsel might have known.       He did have one counsel. He had one counsel because he only graduated from the eighth grade.     That's why we provide counsel.     And that counsel could have known, no?       She was a graduate of Yale law school; wasn't she?       And another of his counsel, Mr. Singer -- of the three that he had -- he was a graduate of Harvard law school; wasn't he?       Son of a gun.
12-10 +++$+++        Well, it isn't just able to do.     Are -- are you saying that they -- they just can't make it a prior condition, but they can select applicants on the basis of which ones they know agree Page 31 with the government's objectives? You -- you have two equally qualified -- technically, two equally qualified applicants, and the government intentionally picks the one whose views on -- on prostitution are -- are similar to the government's. Is -- is that bad?       Well, my goodness.     They can't --       -- they can't fund the Boy Scouts of America because they like the programs that the BSA has?     They -- they have to treat them equivalently with the Muslim Brotherhood?     Is that really what you're suggesting?       Well, then, you can take into account the -- the principles and the -- and the policies of -- of the organization that you're giving funding to.       But you -- you go further than that.     In answer to my question, you -- you go further than that, and you say, moreover, even without making it a condition precedent to getting the money, Congress can -- the government cannot intentionally select those people that it thinks are in accord with its views.     Right?     Isn't that what you said? Page 35       I'm not asking what the Court said; I'm asking what you're saying.       Problematic or -- or unconstitutional?       Okay.       Let me -- can I -- can I be sure --       -- I understand what you've just conceded in -- in your response to Justice Breyer? The government could require, as a condition to come into this program and become a partner with the United States, that the recipient not have the viewpoint of favoring prostitution?       Well, you said it's not a viewpoint thing.       I thought that's what you just said to Justice Breyer.       Him or me?     You have to choose. (Laughter.)       Does it say, "profess belief."     I was going to ask you about that.     That's not what the statute says.     It just says they have to have a Page 50 policy.       A policy.     Which means, I suppose, they have to tell their employees don't do anything to -- to foster prostitution, but they don't have to get up -- get up and announce publicly, we oppose prostitution, do they?       They can get all that without making you profess it, unless -- unless you consider the only -- only profession to be the assurance to the -- to your partner, the United States government, that you -- that you, in, fact oppose prostitution.       To tell the government. Okay.     That's -- that's the only profession you're talking about?       Oh, okay.
12-1036 +++$+++       Yes, but the Attorney General says that that's not what's going to happen here.    How do you square that with his statement that that money will not get to these people?      He says you can't -- he says you can't even identify those people.      What -- what do you do about this -- this language in the definition?    I haven't heard you explain it. It -- it says -- it means any -- mass action means "any civil action in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact." Now, they're not proposed to be tried jointly here on that ground.    They're being tried jointly on the ground that the suit is being brought by the attorney general under this State statute.      Yes, I understand that.      Sometimes, they try to catch everything, but the language they use doesn't do it.      You mean it's contrived legislative history? (Laughter.)
12-1038 +++$+++    It was not argued in that case that the statute didn't apply, and that's what you're arguing here.   You keep sliding into the First Amendment issue, which is not the issue on which we granted certiorari. We're only interested in whether the statute applies.   You can raise it, but we don't have to listen to it.   That's -- that's what I'm saying.   They don't say control begins at the green line. To the contrary, they say they have control over the whole installation. Do you deny that, that the -- that the commanding officer has the right to control the entire installation?   Because -- because the commanding officer agreed to that, because that's the term of the -- of the easement.   There may well be, but is there -- is there a difference in the authority of the commanding officer? That's what's crucial.   They're entitled to have it both ways. It's their base. And if that's the deal -- you know, take it or leave it, State. We -- we'll give you this easement, but the -- the terms are what we have said. What's wrong with that?   But if -- if your colleague is correct, that the green line marked the edge of the easement, it would be entirely proper not to -- not to arrest him for violating the base until he left the easement; that is, when he crossed the green line. It has nothing to do with the -- the commanding officer saying this is the only part of the installation that we care about.   It marks the end of the easement.   So we're back to the real estate test. I -- I thought that you were not relying on the -- on the exclusive ownership test. You are?   Oh, okay.   So you're defending the Ninth Circuit's?   Excuse me. What about the portion of the base on the other side of the road easement, where the government does have exclusive possession?   Is that okay? That's still part of the base.   Yes or no, under your theory?   That may be very bad, but is it bad because the government does not have exclusive possession of every --   You know, when you talk about the road, they've given an easement, so you can say, oh, yeah, they don't have exclusive possession. But the other side of the road, that vast tract, you are saying the government, what, does or does not have exclusive possession?   Then the word "possession" means nothing. You are -- you are applying solely a functional test. It only possesses that which it is using for military purposes. That is not a possession test. It's a purely functional test.   It seems to me a First Amendment argument and not an argument that goes to the scope of Section 1382.   So you are saying we should read the statute to say it only applies when it doesn't violate the First Amendment. Of course, we'd read it that way.   But not because it has anything to do with the scope of authority of the government. It's what the government can do. I -- I don't know how to read that -- that text, in such a way that it will avoid all First Amendment problems. There is no way to do that.
12-10882 +++$+++    So you want us to decide this case and establish the principle, the -- the very significant principle that where you have a -- a criminal defendant condemned to death for -- for murder whose scores are 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80, that's okay? That's all you're trying to persuade us of? I mean, I'm not very happy having to go through this in all future cases where you have somebody who has 69, 73, 74, 75, and 81. I mean, don't you have some more general principle, other than the particular scores in this case are good enough.   General Winsor, we --   -- we don't allow all factors to be considered, do we? Would -- would the State have been able to refute his assertion of mental retardation by pointing to the fact that he is the one who seized the young woman, who pushed her into a car, who drove the car with his accomplice following in another car, and who killed her, and -- and killed another -- and killed a policeman, too, later, I guess.   Could the State bring that in and say somebody who is mentally retarded enough -- so mentally retarded as not to be responsible and not to be subject to the death penalty certainly could not have pulled all of this off. This is not a person who is that mentally retarded, significantly mental -- mentally retarded. Could the State show that --   He didn't raise mental retardation until 10 years after his first conviction; isn't that right?   How has it gone on this long? 1978 is when he killed this woman.   General Winsor, maybe you should ask us --   -- that question, inasmuch --   -- as most of the delay has been because of rules that we have imposed.
12-1117 +++$+++    The car is still trying to escape. The car is not stopped and, you know, the driver with his hands up. The car is still trying to get out of this encirclement by the other police cars, right?   Is he trying to get away at that point or not?   Mr. Smith, I was  I was surprised to read what you said in your -- in your brief on page 25: At a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of the Petitioners' objective reasonableness. And that -- isn't that enough to decide this case?   You say that, even though what they did was arguably reasonable, right --   -- immunity does not apply?   We don't it to the jury about whether, you know, whether the police officers violated the Fourth Amendment or not. The rule is if -- if indeed there is no clear violation on their part, if they had no reason to know that what they were doing violated the Fourth Amendment, they are entitled to the immunity. And here you have that statement at a minimum, reasonable minds could differ on the issue of their objective reasonableness. Do you still believe that, that reasonable minds could differ on the issue of their objective reasonableness?   At a minimum. At a minimum. I mean it could be even worse.   I don't care what it's addressing. It's addressing a state of facts, that reasonable minds could differ on the issue of Petitioners' -- do you want to take that back?   I think you ought to take it back.   Such as? What?   They didn't block him. He got away. How can you say they had the ability to block him? He got away, didn't he --   That's too general a rule, and our cases hold that you cannot appeal to a very general rule to say the law is clear. You have to show that the law as applied to these circumstances was clear. And there's nothing about shooting out tires that I know of.   The danger is he is going to be going 100 miles an hour, okay, that the chase up to now has been the way your client's chase was, in which he endangered a lot of other people, forced cars off the road, and so forth. That's -- that's the -- that's the hypothetical. Okay. That person is about to drive away and continue that kind of public-endangering behavior. Can the policeman shoot or not.   No, no. There's nobody around, just -- just him.   There is nobody around. Can -- can they shoot at him to stop him from endangering the public again?   Of course, we -- you know --   You're just not willing to give answers. But we've been discussing this as though that's the question, what should the policeman do? But that's not the question. The question is, was there clearly established law that made it apparent that this was improper police conduct? That's the question. Not what is proper police conduct, but was there clearly established law that this was not proper police conduct? What's your best case for that?   So some of --   Was she trying to get out of the car when -- when he was trapped there and, you know, surrounded by the police car?   She didn't try to get out of the car. I mean, for all the police knew, she -- he -- she was a -- a cohort of his. He fled. Why was he fleeing, by the way? He just didn't want to -- didn't want to get a ticket for the broken headlight?   No -- I thought that there was some indication that he had drugs.   Yes. So that's probably why he was fleeing.   And she might have been a cohort of that. Do -- do -- are the police supposed to know that? She made no effort to get out of the car.   Well, I'd think you'd think pretty quick in a situation like that, where this guy has been driving you on the highway at 100 miles an hour, swerving into and away from police cars. Boy, I would get out of that car so fast.   Of course it's a factor, but is it a factor that your clients can take advantage of? That's the issue. I mean, maybe you -- you can demote the policeman who did that. Maybe even a lawsuit by -- by -- by the colleague in the car would be successful. But the issue is whether your client has any reason to complain about that, your client who caused the whole thing, who caused the shooting in the last analysis.   Okay. This -- this is a new principle. You think it is clearly established law, clearly established law, that you cannot shoot to kill a driver whose -- whose car is moving? Is that it?   Is that the principle you say is clearly established?   My goodness, they do it all the time. You watch the movies about bank robberies, you know, it happens all the time. Are these movies unrealistic? You cannot shoot to kill somebody in a moving car.   And that is -- that is not just your view. It is, you say, clearly established law.   And that's what Scott holds, that you can --   What does hold it? Sir, you are arguing that the law is clearly established. That's the case you have to make. You can't just get up here and say you shouldn't shoot at somebody in a moving car to kill. Maybe you shouldn't. What is the clearly established law that -- that policemen should have known?   Talks about it?   Talks about it?   What facts do you contest and we'll just subtract them from the facts that we consider. Which facts do you contest? That he was driving 100 miles an hour, swerving on the road, swerved towards police cars, almost cause another car to go -- that's -- you don't contest that.   That's not a fact. That's -- that's a conclusion. Whether the car was a -- was a danger is a legal conclusion, not a fact. What facts do you -- do you say are contested?   Right.   Okay. We'll assume no assaults. What else?   All right. We'll eliminate the ramming. What else?   Let's assume -- we'll assume he was not in danger. Okay.   But we -- we are still left with a very dangerous man careening down the road, who is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away to continue his careening. You can eliminate all those minor facts that you're contesting and it's still a very dangerous situation.
12-1128 +++$+++       But -- but you could say that about any declaratory judgment action.    You can say the person bringing the declaratory judgment action is seeking the relief.    And if -- if we follow what you said, that then the burden shifts in every declaratory judgment action.    And it clearly doesn't.    I mean, we - we've said time and again that the burden of proof normally does not shift.    What's different here?      It seems to me it is often the case in declaratory judgment actions that the defendant in the action cannot counterclaim.    I mean, it typically occurs when somebody doesn't want to be in breach of contract and -- and brings a suit to see, you know, claiming if I do this I won't be in breach.    The other side can't counterclaim because the person hasn't been in breach.    The whole purpose of the declaratory judgment statute is to enable you to sue before the other side has a cause of action against you.    That's the whole purpose of it. So -- so why should the fact that the other side doesn't have a counterclaim change anything? That's usually the situation.      But we are not dealing with the normal default rule.    We are dealing with a declaratory judgment statute, and we've said time and time again that it doesn't alter the burden of proof. And your response is:    Well, it does when the other side can't counterclaim.    And my response to that is: Usually the other side can't counterclaim.      Then the Declaratory Judgment Act doesn't change it; that's your position? What do you do about the res judicata problem?    Let's assume that we put the burden of proof where you want it.    Okay?    So this declaratory judgment action is defeated.    All right?    Nonetheless, they say:    Still and all, we are going to go ahead and not pay any royalties. And then you bring -- you bring an infringement action, right?      Is -- is the prior decision res judicata or are you going to have to relitigate the whole thing, but this time with the burden of proof on you?      Why not?    You never -- you never established that you're entitled to any -- any infringement damages.      No, you -- you would normally have the burden as -- as the person claiming infringement.      Of course.      Right?    So you'll have to relitigate the whole thing because you -- you never established that there was infringement.    In the declaratory judgment action, all you've established is that they didn't prove non-infringement.      So we have to relitigate the whole thing.      What's the alternative?      It's my hypothetical, okay?      So your answer is, Justice Scalia, you're right, but it doesn't matter very much. That's your answer, right?      Okay.      The Declaratory Judgment Act is addressed to potential coercion, not actual coercion.    That's the whole point.    You should be able to bring the suit before coercion is applied.    Now, it is true that you're not applying coercion right now, but what they're worried about is if they stop paying the royalties, you will apply coercion and the Declaratory Judgment Act is a way of getting this on the table before a court without their having to go into default and incurring all the penalties, but it is not intended to shift the burden of proof.      It does shift the burden of proof because if what they are worried about is your claiming infringement and exacting a penalty from them for their not paying the royalties that the agreement provides, okay?    That's what they are worried about. The Declaratory Judgment Act enables them to sue beforehand, before they incur liability.    That's its whole purpose, and its purpose is not to shift the burden of proof.      You can always say that in declaratory judgment actions:    That is not the situation we face.    The Declaratory Judgment Act posits a hypothetical situation.    It always does.      I am worried that you are going to sue me later.    You are not suing me now. That's not the situation I face.    But I worry that you will sue me later.      They don't want to -- they don't want to continue to pay royalties.    That's the point.    That's why they bring the Declaratory Judgment Act, so that the court can tell them:    You don't have to pay royalties because this stuff is not covered.
12-1146 +++$+++    Why? Why would it be unreasonable to give -- give EPA authority to regulate mobile sources and not authority to -- to regulate stationary sources, given that stationary sources have to be licensed in this fashion and it -- it produces all sorts of other problems? That doesn't seem to me irrational at all.   Yes, but the 34-year agency interpretation is not a statute.   And you are -- you know, you are saying, oh, rather than alter our 34-year interpretation, we're -- we're going to revise the provisions of the statute. I don't think that's a -- that's a good trade.   General Verrilli, you know, I don't have as expansive a notion of reading exceptions into a statute that are not there as Justice Breyer does. But assuming, just assuming that you can -- you can read exceptions, that isn't the issue here. The issue is whether you can read in exceptions unnecessarily when the absurdity in guestion doesn't flow inevitably from the statute, when the statute can be interpreted another way that would not produce the absurdity. Aren't you compelled where there is ambiguity to adopt the interpretation of the statute that does not produce absurdity rather than adopting the interpretation that produces absurdity, and then going around altering the provisions of the contract -- of the statute? I mean, to take Justice Breyer's bubble gum example, yes, I suppose it -- would you have to make an exception for bubble gum in the display window if the statute were subject to two interpretations, one of which would include display windows, and the other one of which wouldn't. It seems to me, of course, you would have to adopt the interpretation that didn't include display windows. And that's what is going on here. There's -- there's -- yes, there's absurdity but the issue is how is that absurdity to be taken account of? By simply letting EPA rewrite the very clear numbers in the statute, or else by adopting a permissible interpretation of the statute that does not lead to that absurdity. And I think that's guite a different guestion from -- from what we've been discussing.   In the -- you know, the argument against that is, no, that the statute evidences concern with ambient air guality and reguires that to be measured. And the agency acknowledges that you cannot possibly measure the effect on ambient air guality of greenhouse gases. So it is not clearly compatible with the statute to bring greenhouse gases into regulation.   I don't think so. I mean, it depends on what you mean by "unthinkable," General Verrilli. Is it   But what is supposed to be unthinkable, that greenhouse gases should not be regulated? Maybe that is unthinkable. But the issue is, is it unthinkable that Congress did not intend to regulate greenhouse gases when it enacted the current provisions of the statute?   Where have the sea levels risen other than Massachusetts? (Laughter.)
12-1163 +++$+++    Well, you know, once you -- once you have a statute that confers discretion on a district court, you don't expect uniformity of decision-making. It gives the district judge a broad -- broad discretion, and some will come out at the top and some will come out at the bottom. And they will all be -- be affirmed by the court of appeals. So what makes you think that -- that this statute, which clearly confers discretion, envisions uniformity --   -- on the part of the district courts?   It seems to me it quite clearly doesn't.   Well -- well, you -- you acknowledged that a lot of these cases -- probably most of these cases do not involve exclusively legal issues. Right?   And so in -- in all of those cases you're not going to get uniformity, because their -- you acknowledge that in -- in the nonlegal issues, there is discretion in the district court. So you're going to have some district courts coming out some ways, other district courts coming out the other way, and they will all be affirmed. So the -- it seems to me -- this does not strike me as an area where Congress expected uniformity.   You're -- you're creating uniformity in one narrow aspect of -- of this decision, that involving legal claims, but there are many other aspects of the decisions that will destroy whatever uniformity you're trying to achieve.
12-1168 +++$+++    This is not a protest case. These people don't want to protest abortion. They want to talk to the women who are about to get abortions and try to talk them out of it. I -- I think it -- it distorts it to say that what they want to do is protest abortion. If it was a protest, keeping them back 35 feet might not be so bad. They can scream and yell and hold up signs from 35 feet. But what they can't do is try to talk the woman out of the abortion. It's a counseling case, not a -- not a protest case.   Well, surely you could have a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or protesting within 35 feet. Isn't that more narrowly tailored? I mean, what this case involves, what these people want to do is to speak quietly and in a friendly manner, not in a hostile manner, because that would -- that would frustrate their purpose, with the people going into the clinic.   You should say yes. (Laughter.)   I don't understand it. It's a permissible purpose to say this is a safe facility, but not a permissible purpose to say this is an unsafe facility?   Is that --   I  I object to you calling these people protestors, which you've been doing here during the whole presentation. That is not how they present themselves. They do not say they want to make protests. They say they want to talk quietly to the women who are going into these facilities. Now how does that make them protestors?   This is testimony by the -- by the clinics themselves, right?   What's the alternative here?   Standing 35 feet away and yelling?   Is that the alternative?   To comfort these women?   They don't know who's going into the clinic.   Until you get to the area close to the clinic, you don't know whether passersby are going there or not.
12-1173 +++$+++    Wait, wait. Before you go, you really think the Court was saying, It will be an easement when that suits the government, but it will be something else when that suits the government?   I mean, it's either an easement or it's not an easement. You really think the -- the opinion meant to reserve the question whether it was an easement.   Did they give compensation to the people --   -- to whom they pronounced that?   That can't change the meaning of the 1875 Act.   It reflects a later Congress's understanding of what an earlier Congress did. We don't --   -- interpret statutes on the basis of what later Congresses think they meant.   People have done it.   But both of them want more Federal lands, that's surprising, right, both agriculture and --   What about adverse possession? Can't the -- can't the --   I would think if there's been no objection to these spaghetti strips of land, I don't think condemnation would cost the government a whole lot for that matter. What, you know --   -- what a spaghetti strip of land through --   Yes, but you should -- should know how much land the United States owns. It's -- it's incredible that -- that there's no record in the Interior Department or anywhere else of what land the United States own. You claim you own these thousands of acres, and you say we've not kept track of it. We just know where it's going to go, but we don't know what we own.
12-1182 +++$+++    Can I ask, until you propose your SIP to replace the FIP, right, the FIP remains in effect?   And you're bound by that until they approve your new SIP. How long does such a transaction normally take?   You think that's a guick process? I mean, as soon as --   If you'll have to develop a new SIP, that'll take you some time?   And then that SIP is -- is submitted to EPA, and -- and they chew on it for as long as they want, right?   And then maybe they will say, your SIP is good enough, and maybe they won't.   And that means the statute doesn't reguire you to do that, I assume.   I mean, when they say that, that -- that's an affirmation by them that the statute does not reguire you to do it, I assume. Is that your point?   Well, they have done the impossible here, haven't they? I mean, they have the transport rule. The only guestion is whether it should have come out sooner or later, right? The only guestion is whether it should have come out before the States were obliged to submit their SIPs.   You started to give us a second statutory reason. I was really eager to see what that was.   Would you finish describing the issue? I really didn't hear it.   Well, I think -- I think it would follow that if you did it for good cause to -- to apply the rule, you can do it for good cause to abolish it, not that you can do it by rulemaking when you adopt it and then used good cause when you -- when you abolish it. It would seem, to me, to sguare with the text.   "In the same manner"?   Amounts significantly attribute, right? It's -- it's amounts.   Yes, yes. Not conducts significantly.   It isn't contributions to nonattainment. It's the word "amounts." The statute prohibits activity within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will contribute significantly.   Okay. Amounts are amounts. I mean, it doesn't --  (Laughter.)   But the basketball thing is -- to make it parallel to what's at issue here, the guestion you should ask the coach, which -- which of the -- you lost 101 to 100. Which of the 101 points contributed most to your loss? (Laughter.)   It's -- it's the one that was the layup. I mean, he would not answer the one that was the layup. He'd say what do you mean? All -- all of the 101.
12-1184 +++$+++    Do you think Congress could not require the loser to pay -- in all cases?   -- in all cases?   I mean, if it can do that, there's certainly no First Amendment problem.   That's the English rule. It used to be our rule. I don't see how you can possibly say that it's unconstitutional to make the loser pay.   Mr. Phillips, their lawyers might well have given them different advice if they didn't know that, Hey, nothing to lose, given the test that the Federal Circuit has, you know.   Hey, I would give -- I would give the same advice. Bring the suit.   This guy is a possible competitor, sue him. Hey, there's nothing to lose.   If it goes to litigation, yes. But if -- if the alternative for the defendant is either, you know, spend $2 million defending or pay off the $10,000 that -- that the plaintiff demands to go away, hey, that's an easy call.
12-1200 +++$+++    So you -- you read me -- want me to read that -- that when a district judge refers the matter to a bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter an appropriate order, the bankruptcy judge can say, you know, I'm just too busy.   I'm on Easter vacation and I may hear and determine it, and I may enter appropriate orders, but I don't feel like it.   It doesn't say that it may refer. It says, "bankruptcy judges may hear and determine."   How do you bring the "may" over to the district court?   Then then the "may" that you're concerned with is the "may" in (a), not the "may" in (b) .   And what the other side says is that's very nice, but that's not what the statute says. The statute does not give the bankruptcy court the authority to enter a -- a simply recommendation for what has been defined as a core proceeding. For core proceedings, what the statute says is you'll -- is you'll determine it. And you're saying, well, it says that, but since it's been held unconstitutional, we're going to shift this over to the -- to the category in which they -- they can issue an order and recommendation. Where does that come from?   No, that's not my problem. My problem is -- is not why they don't have to enter an order and judgment. My problem is why they are authorized to issue a recommendation.   Where does that come from? They're not issued -- they're not authorized to issue recommendations for core proceedings.   Oh, really? I mean, can a district judge sort of -- you know, it's not terribly important because it's just a recommendation. So I'm going to refer it to my former partner, you know, my former law partner.   Yes, even with the consent of the parties.   To a special master.   But it has statutory authority to do that. There is no statutory authority here to refer a matter to a bankruptcy judge for nothing other than a recommendation, except for noncore matters.   So it can do that for core -- for those core proceedings that were not held unconstitutional under Stern, right?   It can just refer them and say just give me the eggs.   I don't need the bacon.   You don't have to determine it; just give me your recommendation.   It seems to me the dichotomy set forth in the statute disappears once you say "hear and determine" means either "hear and determine" or "hear or determine."   The whole dichotomy of the statute disappears.   I want to go back to your statement that the district court here has both original and appellate jurisdiction because it can recall the reference to the bankruptcy judge. Can it recall the reference after the bankruptcy judge has issued his decision in the case?   Has entered a judgment in the case?
12-123 +++$+++        I'm really -- I'm really confused.     You are saying there ought to be a remand here because the question is not jurisdictional, which is just what your friend says, right?       So the two of you are in agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong, we can review that.       That may well be, but --       -- you don't have to pay the penalty if you give us the raisins.       You mean they -- Is that right, they have to give the raisins?       Okay.     So --       -- that amounts to the same thing, your raisins or the penalty, right?       That couldn't be what the statute meant.     I think that's what Justice Breyer says. Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're going to take your raisins and then you can go to the Court of Claims and get your money back.     I mean, that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated. The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get your money back in the Court of Claims. Now, if you're raising a constitutional objection, that's something else.     That should be done in district court.     But to say that Congress contemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your money back.     That's a weird statute.       And you -- you think that's a close question?     You think that the way the statute is supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the government takes the raisins and every year, the grower goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for the raisins.     Is that the program that Congress anticipated?       I don't think it's close at Page 40 all.     That's a crazy statute.     Every year we're going to take raisins and every year we're going to pay you in the Court of Claims.     What's the purpose of that?       That's -- that's a merits question again.     I mean, it's not a question of whether you -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim. It's a question of whether you are going to win.       A bailee? (Laughter.)       Yes, I suppose a bailee could, a bailee of the car.
12-126 +++$+++ 
12-1281 +++$+++    We don't have a case involving this particular issue yet.   I  I think "happens" continues to mean "chances to be." We still use it that way. But we only use it that way when it is followed by an infinitive. "I happened to see him," it means a chance that I saw him. Or -- you know, 9/11, the destruction of the Twin Towers happened to occur on 9/11. But you wouldn't say -- you wouldn't say it happened on -- on 9/13, simply because it continued to be destroyed. I don't know what the OED examples that Justice Kagan referred to were, but I bet they -- they used "happen" followed by an infinitive, and I think we still use it that way.
12-1315 +++$+++    Excuse me. Congress cited what?   Well, that may just mean -- you know, where it is a defense, it is an affirmative defense that has to be treated the way rule 8(c) says. I don't think that rule 8(c) establishes that it applies in law, as well as in equity, and that's the question I want to ask you. How -- do you -- do you say that -- that laches was a defense available at law before the Federal Rules were enacted? Or do you say that courts continue to have the power to bring it from equity into law after the rules were enacted? And if the latter, why so?   They had -- they had been used in law before -- before the rules --   Excuse me. Did not dispute what? What?   Okay.   But you've said  I think you've said that -- that it would apply to ordinary statute of limitations. So if you have a six-year statute of limitations and you don't sue until five years after, you're subject to the defense, well, you should have -- should have sued sooner.   I  I share Justice Kagan's reservation about that. Could we limit our opinion just to rolling statutes?
12-133 +++$+++        I don't see -- I don't see how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal suit.     That happened for years before there was such a thing as class action in Federal courts.     Nobody thought the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be vindicated.       And I don't see why it's any different when you transpose the situation to the -- to the arbitration situation.       You -- you -- I don't understand.     You think they could have appealed on that -- on that issue?       Let me ask you.     Your effective vindicability principle depends upon a comparison with what you could do in Court.       It doesn't?       Yes, but if you couldn't do it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration agreement be -- be harming you?     I don't understand that.       Or in court.       You have to compare it to court.       If you couldn't do it in court, you don't have to be able to do it in arbitration, it seems to me.       They could write a treatise on it, maybe.       Suppose this class could not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal court.     Are you asserting that there is some arbitration principle that -- that allows you to create some new class?       So you have to make -- you have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal court, don't you?       It isn't.     So that any class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required.       But he wants a class.     What he wants in the arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf of a class, doesn't he?      Is -- is that what you asked for below, anything, class action or compensation or whatever?      That's what I thought. That's what I thought this case was about.    What's the question presented anyway?      Whether -- whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts invoking the Federal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim. Now, you're saying that -- that whether they permit class arbitration is not going to be decided on the basis of whether you could certify a class under Rule 23, but just what? And -- and -- and if it does depend on that, what is the Court supposed to do?     Before it can -- it can give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide whether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it? My goodness --       -- this is a very complicated procedure.       You should have said, "I accept," very quickly. (Laughter.)       Would that be the case even before Rule 23 was -- was adopted?       Even though you couldn't vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to vindicate it in arbitration?       I'm not even talking about a pure exculpatory clause.     I'm talking about the mere fact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to bring it in arbitration.     In a context in which it is also impossible to bring it in Federal court. And you would say, still, you must permit it to be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be brought in Federal court.       What -- what are the arbitration fees?     It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees. Do they include lawyers' fees?       Okay.     So I don't know, what do you --       So what are you comparing it to in court litigation?       A filing fee?       Excuse me.     They didn't get cert granted on that question at all.     As I pointed out before, they got it granted on whether the mere fact that the arbitration agreement did not permit class arbitration renders it invalid.       That's what I thought the question before us.
12-135 +++$+++        That's -- that's all he has to do is saying -- you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?       I mean, we -- we were concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company betting the company, right, on -- on class action whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration because class arbitration -- you know, will bankrupt the company and without an appeal to the court or -- you know, not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway.     And you're saying that, in effect, you do bet the company every time. So long as you leave it up to the arbitrator to decide whether there's a class action allowed or not, which most agreements probably do, he can find whatever he likes, right?     He can find -- so long as he says, I'm interpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly inconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's nothing the courts can do about it.       And you think that standard -- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to what the contract says, and the court has to accept that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.       Just exactly that?       What supports his decision? I mean, you -- you say that.     What -- what supports his decision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's the standard.     Did they agree to class arbitration? What -- what supports that?       I don't understand.     There is a distinction between all disputes and all actions relating to the dispute?       The top of page 6?       Yes.       But that's not enough.     As stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a plausible construction.     It's not enough that he said, I'm construing the contract.     I have looked at the terms of the contract and what the parties' said, and my construction of the contract is X. That's not enough. It has to be plausible.       Now, why is this plausible?       What's a magic 8-ball? don't know what you are talking about. I (Laughter.)       Did these other people agree to this arbitrator?     I mean, they might have said, this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say that -- that we agreed to class action.     We didn't agree to class -- I don't want this arbitrator. They didn't agree to this arbitrator.     Why should they be bound by -- by whatever he says?       How can they opt out if they've agreed to class arbitration?       Are you sure?     It seems to me if they've agreed to class arbitration, they've agreed to class arbitration.       How many have there been? Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?       Do you have any idea?       I'm sure there's been a number.     What's the number?       It could be less than 100?
12-1371 +++$+++    It wouldn't be the first mistake of course, right? It wouldn't be the first mistake Congress has made.   Even if they wouldn't, once again, Congress may have miscalculated. It may have thought that this language, which it -- which intended, as you have described, would cover a lot of State statutes. And as it turns out, it didn't. And that wouldn't be the first congressional statute that didn't achieve what it thought it was going to achieve, right.   So he was convicted of causing violent injury?   So we sort of have two extreme positions here. The government is arguing that the statute covers mere touching. That's one extreme. And you're arguing that the statute doesn't cover all bodily injury, but only what, severe bodily injury?   Why isn't there something in the middle? It doesn't cover touching but it covers bodily injury?   Yes, but you would lose, right? (Laughter.)   Soap in the eyes.   How about soap in the mouth? I've had that. (Laughter.)   Well, none of those things would be done intentionally, so they -- they don't scare me. But -- but I do think of a -- you know, a parent washing out a child's mouth with soap for -- for improper speech or a -- a mother pinching a child in -- you know, to bring the child under control in public. And that inflicts pain. It inflicts injury. And I worry about that being covered by -- by this Federal statute.   But I -- really you have no answer to Johnson, except that -- that statement was dictum. And it was -- the case did not have to define the precise amount of injury necessary, right?   I -- I assume that your point is it's a trap for the unwary, that -- that someone who has not really been guilty of violent action would not expect that he's covered by the -- by the prohibition on carrying a gun. He is not a violent person.
12-138 +++$+++    Why -- why are you complaining about the other party not initiating proceedings in the Argentine courts when, if you really wanted those proceedings to occur, you could have initiated proceedings in the Argentine courts?   I must say I don't understand that. When -- when you're appealing to a condition for the thing to occur and you can bring that about as -- as readily as the other side, it's -- dog in the manger comes to mind.   I don't think he conceded it. He conceded that that was your argument.   There's a subtle difference between the two. (Laughter.)
12-1408 +++$+++    What are you saying, "SUB payments"?   I'm not hip.   Why are they giving them the money, just out of love? I mean, they don't give it to me when I retire. They only give it to their employees when they retire. What -- what are they paying them for? Aren't they paying them for faithful and good past services?   No, they are -- they are just being generous?   Why don't they do that for me?   Was the earlier statute definition of wages for tax purposes, was that reenacted at the same time?   So you really have -- you call into play the principle that you should interpret a statute to make sense and not interpret any provision to be superfluous, right?   And you say that the government's interpretation renders (o) superfluous.   We'll ask him about that.
12-142 +++$+++        The jury decides all of this, right?       That's wonderful. Twelve -- twelve tried men and few -- and true decide for the whole State what the -- what the cost/benefit analysis is for a -- a very novel drug that unquestionably has some deleterious effects, but also can save some lives. And the jury's going to decide that?       The Feds didn't say to do the opposite.     They said -- they didn't say you have to drive in New Hampshire.     They say, you must drive on the right if you drive.     They don't require you to drive in New Hampshire.
12-144 +++$+++        Who -- who would appoint him?     The same governor that didn't want to defend the plebiscite?       I suppose -       You -- you've led me right into a question I was going to ask.     The California Supreme Court decides what the law is.     That's what we decide, right?     We don't prescribe law for the future. We -- we decide what the law is.     I'm curious, when - when did -- when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage?     1791?     1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted? Sometimes -- some time after Baker, where we said it didn't even raise a substantial Federal question?     When -- when -- when did the law become this?       When do you think it became unconstitutional?     Has it always been unconstitutional?       That -- that's not when it became unconstitutional.     That's when they acted in an unconstitutional matter -- in an unconstitutional manner.     When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit gays from marrying?       I'm not talking about the California Supreme Court.     I'm talking about your argument.     You say it is now unconstitutional.       Was it always unconstitutional?       I see.     When did that happen?     When did that happen?       Well, how am I supposed to know how to decide a case, then -   -- if you can't give me a date when the Constitution changes?       So it would be unconstitutional even in States that did not allow civil unions?       Okay.     So I want to know how long it has been unconstitutional in those -       It seems to me you ought to be able to tell me when.     Otherwise, I don't know how to decide the case.       50 years ago, it was okay?       I can't either.     That's the problem.     That's exactly the problem.       Yeah, but the rest of the country has been cautious.       And we're -- and you are asking us to impose this on the whole country, not just California.       So your -- your position is only if a State allows civil unions does it become unconstitutional to forbid same-sex marriage, right?
12-1493 +++$+++    As to the first, are there two buyers in your view?   Well, what does -- what does the person who's buying for somebody else -- he has to provide both names or just the name of the real buyer?   And both of them had to take possession, right?   But that's not the case here. The person who paid took possession, was authorized to take possession .   So there are two buyers and both of them have to be on the form.   Where's the straw buyer? I can understand you saying the real buyer is the person who put up the money.   Its current one. It used to have a different one.   Why is that  why is that any more horrible than the notion that as soon as I buy it I walk out of the store and I meet this guy in the parking lot, he says: Hey, that's a nifty looking gun there. How much did you pay for it? He says: You know, I paid 600 dollars. I'll give you 700. Oh, it's yours. Right? I can hand it to him, can't I?   So the notion that the gun would somehow get into the hands of somebody who -- you know, who wasn't registered or who couldn't buy it himself, I mean that's going to happen any way. What you assert does not stop that problem.   You wouldn't think of prosecuting him, would you? (Laughter. )   Before you go on --   -- I wanted to get back to the Al Capone hypothetical. As I understand Petitioner's case here, I don't think he's asserting that if Al Capone, if -- if he intended to transfer it to Al Capone, that his statement would not have been material. His position is, since I intended to transfer it to somebody who could lawfully possess it, the statement was immaterial.   Is that on the appendix to your brief?   I can't look at all these things because they are not in your brief. I really -- I really resent, especially in statutory cases, not having the statute in front of us. I shouldn't have to flip through your -- your brief to see what page you cite a little snippet from one section on.   This is a criminal statute. And -- and you're saying that when -- when I buy it and I told somebody I'll sell it to you later, that I am acting as an agent? Wow. It's a criminal statute.
12-158 +++$+++       So your answer is if -- if that unimaginable thing should happen, it would be okay?      All right.      I'd like to -- I'd like to explore that, your proposition that there's no daylight between the treaty itself and the implementing legislation. It seems to me there -- there's a lot of daylight between the two.    Let's take -- and I pick this example not because it's controversial, but because it relates to an area where the Federal government has never been thought to have authority, namely family law. There are no, you know Federal marriage, Federal divorce, Federal adoption.    It's all been State law. Let's assume that an international treaty is approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the president which requires States to -- to approve same sex marriage.    All right? Now, if -- if that were a self-executing treaty, same sex marriage would have to be approved by every State.    If it is not self-executing, however, it will be up to Congress to produce that result, and Congress would do it or could do it at least by having a Federal marriage law.    And then you would have to have a Federal divorce law and, I suppose, a Federal adoption law. I think there is a big difference between just doing it through a self-executing treaty and dragging the Congress into -- into areas where it has never been before. I think there is daylight between the treaty and requiring the treaty to be implemented in the fashion that you assert is necessary here.      I don't think it has to be the case.    I think there -- there's a great difference between requiring the states by a self-executing treaty to permit same sex marriage and dragging the Federal government or allowing the Federal government to enter into this whole field of marriage, divorce, adoption, family law, where the Federal government has never been.      Do horses eat potatoes?    I didn't know horses ate potatoes.      All of those quotes pertain to self-executing treaties.    Yes, there is no limitation on what -- what the President and the Senate can impose as a self-executing requirement, namely that the States must give back to British citizens property that they confiscated or whatever else.    But it's a different question whether a treaty can expand the power of the Federal Congress into areas that it has never been before.    That's a separate question.    And neither Hamilton nor any of the other quotes that you refer to address that question.
12-167 +++$+++  
12-17 +++$+++        But the Virginia citizens      And the out-of-Staters don't pay for the database.      And, besides, do -- do you -- is it the law that -- that the State of Virginia cannot do anything that's pointless? Only -- only the Federal Government can do stuff that's pointless? (Laughter.)      Or even for commercial purposes.    Don't you think if -- if those who created these government in the sunshine laws could have drafted them in such a way that inquiries for commercial purposes would not be allowed, but only those inquiries that are intended to look into the workings of State government and produce government in the sunshine, don't you think that they probably would have excluded commercial inquiries, if they could? But you can't tell which ones are commercial and which aren't.      You are saying that it's no more necessary for you to show that there's no commercial value to allowing out-of-Staters to do this than it is necessary for you to show that there is no commercial value to your not allowing out-of-Staters to hunt deer in Virginia.       You say that it's up to Virginia -      -- whether -- whether out-of-Staters can hunt for Virginia game.      And it's up to Virginia whether out-of-Staters can have access to the State's records, that they have no interest in, personally, under -- under this law.    It seems, to me, perfectly logical.       I didn't understand -- if that's your argument on it, I reject it as Justice Kennedy does.    I -- I didn't understand you to be arguing that there is no commercial value.      Yes, that's what I thought. (Laughter.)      You -- you can't say discriminatory regulation.    What about a tax?    I mean, you can't tax discriminatorily, and I wouldn't call taxation, in and of itself, a regulation of commerce,    would you?      Well, even though it's - even though it's not a regulation of commerce?      Okay.    I mean, I guess that's your argument, then.       We are talking about      There is not much that's as close to the sovereignty of the State as the possession and right to exclude people from its own records and its own documents, right?      So the -- the issue is can the State allow its own citizens, for purposes of seeing that the government is -- is being run on the up-and-up, have access to those documents, without letting the whole world?
12-207 +++$+++        Mr. Shanmugam, I -- I wouldn't have made the concession that you've made, that this case is about reasonable expectation of privacy. If there's no reasonable expectation of privacy, there's no search. But, here, there is a search.     You have a physical intrusion.     You -- you pull a guy's cheek apart and stick a -- a swab into his mouth.     That's a search, reasonable expectation of privacy or not.       Well, I thought you did.       He gave us one and two.     I have been waiting for three.     Will you drop the shoe? (Laughter.)
12-236 +++$+++        Could I -- I have been thinking about your last point.     Couldn't that last point easily be remedied by -- by simply our holding that -- you know, you -- you can't ride both horses; that if, in fact, you've litigated it through to a -- to a merits judgment in your favor, which presumably has stare decisis effect, you then cannot come back and say the suit never occurred because the filing was too late. I mean, we -- I think we're able to hold that, don't you think?       I mean, I agree with you it's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for the government to do, to win the case and get -- get stare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get lawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right? Page 44       We could make that up, couldn't we?       Sure.
12-246 +++$+++        Well, it would be up to the jury, wouldn't it?     The jury might well agree with Justice Sotomayor, that it doesn't prove anything that he answered a question, right?       The question is whether you can ask the jury to consider that.       He wouldn't say that.     He would say one of the indications of his guilt is that he refused to answer the question.     No prosecutor would argue that, that alone, would support a conviction, right?       That's the line you're drawing, between his -- his just not answering and his saying, I don't want to answer?       The latter can't be introduce to the jury, but the former can?       Why would you -- why would you draw that -- that line?       Doesn't the mere silence suggest, "I don't want to talk anymore"?       But I thought you said he didn't have to do that, if he didn't answer any questions, didn't you?     Isn't that what you said?
12-25 +++$+++        What is -- what is south? I don't have a compass here. (Laughter.)       It's not just that language.     It's "investigation in anticipation of litigation."     If I understand you correctly, you are saying investigation includes solicitation.       Isn't that your position?       I don't -- I don't think that is fair.     I think their position is, to harmonize (b)(4) and (b)(12), you have to interpret investigation, not to include solicitation, because, otherwise, you have a conflict, that (b)(12) prohibits solicitation, unless you have the consent; whereas, (b)(4), which says, "investigation," does not require consent. Now, the two exist in perfect harmony if investigation does not include solicitation, but there -- there is a discrepancy between the two if it does include solicitation.     And you have to say, well, this is an exception from (b)(12).       They're north of that line, (Laughter.)       I don't know which is specific and which is general.     I mean, that's the problem I have with that.       I don't understand what you're saying.     You're saying the State Bar requirements would have required you to say, are you interested in joining the lawsuit?       Yes.
12-3 +++$+++       It's sort of post-legislative history, which we usually don't pay attention to.    The -- the problem that I have is if - if the statute does not cover contractors', subcontractors', firing of their own people, what - what coverage does it have?    A subcontractor usually cannot fire somebody from the principal company that's traded on the exchange.      I don't -- I don't see how it can harass or threaten either if it's -- if it's an employee of another company -      -- that it has no power to fire.      But you -- you're -- you're eliminating the -- the principal contractors who might have that kind of power.    You say they're not covered.      Yes, yes, yes.      Including by accountants and lawyers.      How so if -- if accountants and lawyers are not -- are not contractors?      What does it mean that they're not regulated as contractors here?    Unless it means that contractor here does not include them.      It's a very sensible limitation.    Unfortunately, it's not there.      I assume you would say that that rulemaking would be ultra vires, if it took the position that the government's taking here, right?      But even if they did and they came out with a rule that reads just the way the government presented it today, you would say that that is an unreasonable reading of the statute, wouldn't you?      Who was it, counsel? (Laughter.)
12-307 +++$+++        It has not arisen very often in the past because in the past, when I was at the Office of Legal Counsel, there was an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel which says that the Attorney General will defend the laws of the United States, except in two circumstances.     Number one, where the basis for the alleged unconstitutionality has to do with presidential powers.     When the presidential powers are involved, he's the lawyer for the President.     So he can say, we think the statute's unconstitutional, I won't defend it. The second situation is where no possible rational argument could be made in defense of it.     Now, neither of those situations exists here.     And I'm wondering if we're living in this new world where the Attorney General can simply decide, yes, it's unconstitutional, but it's not so unconstitutional that I'm not willing to enforce it, if we're in this new world, I -- I don't want these cases like this to come before this Court all the time. And I think they will come all the time if that's -- if that's -- if that's the new regime in the Justice Department that we're dealing with.       Excuse me.     It's not your view.     It's the President's.     It's only when the President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can decline to defend it?     Or what if the Attorney General thinks it's unconstitutional?       Or the Solicitor General, is that enough?       Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General?       So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General, in his view, thinks it's unconstitutional?       Is that right?       Yes or no?       It's not what the OLC opinion said, by the way.       Didn't Chadha -- didn't Chadha suggest that Congress could have standing in -- in Chadha?       In Chadha, there was an argument that Congress had standing because what was at issue in the case was precisely a prerogative of Congress to exercise the one-house or two-house veto.       But that's -- that's the same in the example that he just gave you, that discrimination would have been visited on the same group, and you say there it's okay.       So you think that's bad as well, that all three of those have to be treated the same, despite State law about marriage.       I don't understand your answer.     Is your answer yes or no?     Is there a federalism problem with that or isn't there a federalism problem?       Well, it's just -- all these statutes use the term "marriage," and the Federal government says in all of these statutes when it says marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the State acknowledges them to be married or not.       Does it -- does it create a federalism problem?       Yes.       Well, it's not doing that, it's just saying for purposes -- just what it's doing here.     It says, for purposes of all these Federal statutes, when we say marriage, we mean -- instead of saying we mean heterosexual marriage, we mean, whenever we use it, heterosexual and homosexual marriage. If that's what it says, can it do that?       No, no, no, no.     It includes --       Why -- why are you so confident in that -- in that judgment?     How many -- how many States permit gay -- gay couples to marry?       Nine.     And -- and so there has been this sea change between now and 1996.
12-315 +++$+++    Where are you reading?
12-357 +++$+++        What -- what is -- I have a property interest in doing my job?     I don't know what that means.     I mean, just throwing words around.     You are calling doing a job a property interest.     Normally when I think of property, I think of something that can be conveyed.     Can I convey the -- the doing of my job to somebody else?       But I'm not talking about my labor.     I'm talking about my doing the job that the employer has assigned to me.       It's not my -- not my labor in the abstract.     Nobody is taking my labor away from me.       Can you cite me one -- one extortion case at common law -- or let me put it another way.     What is the closest extortion case at common law that you can allude to?       We -- we are using a common law term here, "extortion."       Whatever.     What's the closest that comes to this abstract, "the doing of my job is property"?       What -- what's the closest New York case?       Well, that -- that's the problem with your New York cases as well.     You -- you are focusing on property in another context, where the property is harmed, not whether property is taken. You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other common law case involving extortion where the property taken consists of somebody's doing his job.       I'm not sure that obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one and the same thing, I'm really not.       You are -- you are contradicting what you yourself said a little bit before, which is that property means the same thing for both provisions -       -- for both the obtaining and the harming.       But it doesn't mean the same thing for the harming because there is some property that can't be harmed.       Why is that valuable to me? Why is it valuable to me -- I can see how the job is valuable to me.     I get paid to do the job.     But why making one recommendation rather than another is valuable to me?     I don't think it's valuable to me.       It's only because I'm an honest person that I want to make the proper recommendation, but to say that it has any economic value that I recommend A rather than B?     It's -- it's totally neutral whether one is -- is more economically valuable than the other.       That's all very true and an honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give the right advice rather than the wrong advice.       Oh, I see.     I see.       Is what -       Was that one of the choices the jury had?       But not the obtaining of property.       That's true.     Not the obtaining the property, right?       What do you think would be covered by coercion that wouldn't be covered by the Government's extortion theory here? Give me an example of -- of coercion?       Well, for example -       Why -- why isn't that property?     Why?     You know, my -- my choice of marrying whom I want, why isn't that as much property as -- as my ability to -- to perform my job the way I want?       A lot of people marry for money. (Laughter.)       Well, it -- it at least makes available the argument that you don't have to go this far, that there are other provisions that would enable you to get to this person.       So why -- instead of inducing us to define property so broadly that it's unrecognizable, as far as I am concerned -       We're talking about property for purposes of extortion, the common law crime of extortion.       I don't think property is property.     I think property can -- can have a -- a different meaning with -- with regard to various provisions of the law.     And -- and the provision of the law defining extortion brings with it a whole baggage of -- of common law cases.     And that may well be different from the word "property" used in some other Federal statute that does not invoke the common law of extortion.
12-398 +++$+++        Well, well, well, well, this is something I was going to ask you.     I -- I assume that it's true that -- that those abridged genes, whatever you want to call them, do exist in the body. That they do exist.     You -- you haven't created a type of gene that does -- does not exist in the body naturally.
12-399 +++$+++        Do you apply a "best interest of the child" standard to a termination of parental rights?       I mean, can -- can -- I know a lot of kids that would be better off with different parents.       It sure is.     And do you know of any State that -- that applies best interest of the child standard to termination of parental rights as opposed to adoption?       Aren't there Federal definitions of approvals of tribes?     Not every group of native Americans who get together can call themselves a tribe.       And isn't one of the conditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not of voluntary membership?       I'm quite sure that's right.     So I think the hypothetical is -- is a null set. I don't think it ever exists.       Is my recollection correct that -- that he had offered to -- to marry the mother, and she rejected that?       Well, that -- that was after she had rejected his offer to marry her, no?       I don't know why you make that concession.     I mean, your client has been deprived of parental rights.     I do not know that -- that it is traditional to decide whether a parent will be deprived of parental rights by assessing what is in the best interest of the child. That seems to me quite -       -- extraordinary, not normal.       It says that, doesn't it? A parent is -- is the -- the biological parent.       That's what it says.       Wait.     I didn't understand. Citizenship, who has acknowledged citizenship?       Okay.     I understand now.       That's a very strange way to put it.     I mean, just -- just in passing in the sentence, that "the continued custody."     I mean, you would think if that's what they meant, they would say, "where the child" is -- "is within the custody of a parent, comma, no termination of parental rights may be ordered, in the absence of a determination," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It doesn't say that.     It says, "No termination may be ordered in absence of a determination, including testimony of a qualified expert, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional." When it's -- when it's framed that way, I am -- I am inclined to believe that the "continued custody" means looks to the future, the continuing custody by this person in the future.     To read into it the fact that -- that the whole provision only applies to someone who is then in custody of the child, that's very strange.     That's -- that's not the way somebody would write a provision like that.
12-414 +++$+++        Well, that's true, but - but you -- you have the duty, or -- or counsel for the defendant has the duty to show that counsel did not do that.     It's -- it seems to me you are putting the burden on the other side to -- to prove that the -- that counsel knew all this.     And that's not the way -- that's not the way the game is played.       I don't know that it's so strange to make the prosecutor -- to make the prosecution submit an offer that can no longer be accepted.     I mean, it doesn't seem to me any more strange than to make the prosecution submit an offer where the situation was at the beginning.     You do this, and I will -- you know, I will prosecute.     The quid pro quo was you avoid the possibility of conviction. But here, she's already been convicted.     She had a trial -- you know, by 12 fair, impartial jurors, and she was guilty.     That's -- that's what the jury found.     So it seems to me just as strange to make the prosecution, now that we know she's guilty, submit - submit that prior offer. So, I mean, it seems to me quite weird, in any event.     So one -- one incremental weirdness is -- is not so bad.
12-416 +++$+++        You can't -- you can't possibly figure it out, can you, without assessing the strength of the patent?  Isn't that crucial to -- to the conclusion?  I -- I believe that the And to say you can consider every other factor other than the strength of the patent is -- is to leave -- leave out the -- the elephant in the room.
12-417 +++$+++       I think -- I think the government is -- you and the government are fighting simply because the government is being principled.    The word of the statute is "clothes."    And nobody would consider eyeglasses or a wristwatch or some of this other specialized equipment to be clothes.    I mean, the word is what it is. And -- and I mean, it's wonderful to say, we can eliminate all the problems by, you know, saying everything is clothes, you know.    Everything, no matter what, wristwatch, eyeglasses.    Well, yes, it makes a - a lovely world.    But it does not adhere to the words of the statute which says "clothes."    Doesn't that mean anything?    Everything is clothes.      Well, if it doesn't matter, why make a liar out of us?    You know, why -- why make us say something that -- that everybody knows is not true, that everything you put on is clothes.      Earrings, eyeglasses, whatever.      You -- you cannot get that very precise limitation out of the word "clothes."    You just can't.    And say it's protective gear for work, it's not other protective gear.    Okay?    It's only those earrings you have to wear for work, otherwise, earrings are not clothes.    Ah, but if they're required for work, they become clothes.    It doesn't make any sense.      Are there no non-unionized employers that -- that have to confront this problem, and they have to pay -- they have to pay for work time, no?      Yes, and everybody else has to pay for the changing time, right?      It is, so you -- so you have the same issue there, don't you?      I don't know.      You want us to say it's incidental instead of de minimis.      What -- what's the consequence of calling it incidental?
12-418 +++$+++        You don't have to go that far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice Alito just gave.     This is not a statute which only requires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs around the military installation.     This requires him to register anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of Alaska where -- it's just not this case. And even -- even if you would allow that, Page 35 and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable connection to the power to regulate the military, to say wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different question, isn't it?       We've never -- we've never held, have we, that what the Federal government can itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and Proper Clause.     Aren't there two different -- what is necessary and proper for the Federal government itself to do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the Federal government to require private individuals to do.
12-43 +++$+++       That -- that's a way of estimating future value.    I -- I don't know that anybody values a company that -- that is sold on the market by saying how much money did they make in the last 2 years, and we are going to multiply that by 9.    You look at what people were paying you in the market.
12-462 +++$+++    As I understand your argument -- correct me if I am wrong -- he could be terminated without reasonable cause if he happened to be from a State or if the suit was brought under the governing law of a State, which imposed this obligation of good faith as a matter of law. The State says, regardless of what the contract says, even if it says, in its sole discretion, without any obligation of good faith, even if it says that, as a matter of law, there is an obligation of good faith. As I understand your case, you acknowledge that, in that State, he would simply be out of luck.   He would have no cause of action because this is, obviously, not an interpretation of the contract; it is -- it is an imposition of a State reguirement.   Okay. I just --   Wow, somebody's really been given a raw deal -- you know, that's still going to be possible, even if we rule for you here. It depends on what State he's from, right?   Some do; some don't. Some do; some don't.   Ms. Rosenbaum, in -- in our decision in this case, do you think we should apply the presumption against preemption of State law?   But the whole purpose of the ADA was to preempt State laws. I mean, I can understand applying that presumption to other statutes, which say nothing about preemption. The whole purpose of the ADA was to deregulate airlines, was to say there was going to be no Federal regulation, let the free market handle it, and there be will be no State regulation. And you want us to apply a presumption against preemption to that statute?   Would this contract produce a different result if it did not contain the words "in its sole discretion"?   Well, you'd -- you'd you'd still apply the very same doctrine of reasonableness, right? So the words "in its sole discretion" become superfluous.   Yes. I guess different States will treat that differently as well, right?   I find -- I find it hard to believe that you're doing nothing but interpreting a contract when you -- you give it the same outcome, whether it says "in its sole discretion" or does not say "in its sole discretion." I -- I find it hard to grasp how what you're doing in that -- in that case is simply interpreting the contract.   Why does -- it relates to prices. Even if you get credit for miles from staying at certain hotels, it still has the effect of lowering the price for your airline ticket. And, likewise, if you can use your freguent flyer miles to get cheaper hotel rooms, that effectively lowers the price of your airline ticket, doesn't it? I mean, it doesn't seem to me to make any difference whether -- whether the only thing you get from the -- from the freguent flyer mileage is -- you know, is airfares or other goodies. They -- they are all price.   I'm sorry. You are talking about a situation where you can assign your -- your mileage to somebody else who can get the hotel room?   The person who gets the discount for the hotel room is the person who bought the airline ticket, right?   What you say would apply to other contractual obligations of the airlines, right? So, if the airline says you have to get off the plane if the flight attendant tells you to do so, there is going to be a good-faith obligation attached to that, so you can challenge -- challenge those decisions in court?
12-464 +++$+++        Why?     Why do we have to decide it that way?     I mean, I don't like casting into doubt the judgment of the grand jury, but why couldn't we say that, when you're taking away funds that are needed for hiring a lawyer for your defense, you need something more than probable cause?     Couldn't we make that up?       And then say due process requires something more than probable cause?
12-484 +++$+++        Why did they -- why did they include it in a separate section?     If they knew that, why did they have a separate section on retaliation?       I understand that.     Why did they do it, if they knew it was already included?       No, I really don't understand -- I didn't understand the law to be that. You mean if -- if an employee files a discrimination claim, and then is fired -- let's assume there is no other reason, except retaliation; he's fired for filing that claim -- he has to prove not only that he was fired in retaliation for filing, but also that his claim was valid? Is that what you are saying the law is?       I thought that's what you were saying.     I thought that's what Justice Alito's question asked.       In his hypothetical, he did.     Justifiable retaliation, as far as I am concerned. I mean, the employer files a frivolous claim to embarrass the employer.     He can't erase that from his mind.     That's one of the reasons he fired this guy.     And you say, oh, if that's one of the reasons, no matter how frivolous or anything else, he's liable under the law.       I don't understand that. Do you understand that?       But -- but not under this statute.     What I'm concerned about is the text of this statute, which simply destroys your argument that there's no difference between retaliation and race discrimination. Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(A) limits remedies where a defendant acted -- and this is a quote from the statute -- "for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a) of this title." It -- it separates out 2000e-3(a), retaliation, from the other aspects of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin discrimination.       Sir, the statute says what it says.     It doesn't matter when Congress put it in there.     The statute has to be read as a whole.     And, if you read it as a whole, this provision clearly separates out retaliation from race discrimination.       Period.     I mean, it doesn't -- I don't have to psychoanalyze Congress and say did they really mean it, blah, blah, blah.     It's there in the statute.     They didn't take it out.     The statute still makes a clear distinction between the two.       It might be a good idea, though, and -- and, if so, Congress can do it, right?       I mean, the issue is whether this statute does it or not.     The fact that nobody has ever done it before, what difference does that make?       Excuse me.     I don't understand.     Say it again?       Right.       Yes.       You -- you talk about Congress as though it's a continuing body out there, the same people, and would the same people that did this do that.     They are not the same people.     I don't know what Congress it was that passed this particular act versus other anti-discrimination acts.     Some of them may have been Democratic Congresses, and others may have been Republican Congresses. To -- to assume that there is one Congress out there that -- that has to operate logically in all these areas, it seems, to me, unrealistic.     And -- and the best thing we can be guided by is, simply, the text that Congress adopted, however the makeup of that Congress happened to be.       But the maxim that you don't add words where you don't need them doesn't - doesn't help your case.     It hurts your case because, in the other provision that was carried over from the prior law, you -- you were making a nullity of the -- the addition after referring to discrimination on the basis of race, of -- you know, retaliation.
12-515 +++$+++    So you think Congress really wanted the States to have power to stop illegal gambling on Indian lands, but not to have the power to stop illegal gaming on State lands? Is that -- is that the law you think Congress wrote?   Why would anybody want such a -- such a disposition?   Well, you think that rule would apply even when, at the time the statute in question was enacted, there was no belief that there was tribal immunity on State lands?   I thought that was just on reservation. You think that was off reservation as well?   Kiowa was later, of course.   You think they read Puyallup that closely?   I see.   But he says that, if they arbitrated, when they tried to enforce the arbitral judgment, you would assert sovereign immunity.   Well, I mean, that's not an answer.   That -- that statute was based upon judicial decisions that had -- had already held that.   Took it upon itself to accept the Executive's determination of how it ought to play out?   Who made these Indian tribe sovereign? Was it Congress?   I mean, you are appealing to -- you know, other branches' determination. Who decided that Indian tribes are sovereign?  sovereign?   The Constitution by in the Commerce clause Who pronounced them to be This -- this Court. This Court. But -- So I assume that this Court could also determine the scope of their sovereignty.   We do virtually nothing as a matter of common law. We do virtually everything on the basis of the Constitution or statutes. I don't think that that's much of an exception.

12-52 +++$+++        What about the price of the storage?     Are you challenging that?       You've just told us anything that significantly affects the transportation service is covered.     And I think what your brother's argument is, is that this significantly affects the service, whether he can collect for the storage after -- you know, after the -- after towing it by -- by selling it, and by selling it on terms that are not so onerous as to impinge upon his -- his ability to run the business.       He's worried that it'll be preempted.       And he didn't -- he didn't mention Cambridge, did he?       I don't think so.       Yeah, you're both from Boston, Massachusetts. Page 36       I think maybe -- maybe we have to make it up, what the limitation -- I mean, you're quite right, everything's related to everything else.     And we've had trouble with the same -- the very same words with ERISA, and -- and started off trying to give it its -- its apparent meaning, "related to," and we finally concluded you can't do that. So what do you want us to make up?     What kind of a limitation do you -- (Laughter.)       Related to -- related to -- related to the movement of the property.     That's the problem.     It's the "related to" words.       I don't understand what you just said.     Say it again.       Service where?     Service Page 42 where?       Storage, ah.     I see.       How do we discover that? Do we look into the city council hearings or what?       No, I want to be able to look at the law and say the law is preempted or the law isn't preempted.     Don't tell me -- you know, the purpose of the law is this or that.     That's not something I am able to do. Page 44       Yes, that's factual.     But whether the intent of the city council was this or that is not factual.       I thought that is what you meant.      I thought so at the time. (Laughter.)       So it would depend upon how severe the consumer protection law is, is that right? If it's a consumer protection law that really whacks the tow truck operator, that would be different from a moderate, benign consumer protection law?     We have to examine each consumer protection law on its own, is that it?
12-536 +++$+++        And that does not -- that does not evoke any gratitude on the part of the people? I mean, if gratitude is -- is corruption -- you know, don't those independent expenditures evoke gratitude? And is -- is not the evil of big money -- 3.2 million, an individual can give that to an independent PAC and spend it, right?       That line eliminates some of the arguments that have been made here, which are arguments against big money in politics.     There -- big money can be in politics.     The thing is you can't give it to the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, but you can start your own PAC.     That's perfectly good.     I'm not sure that that's a benefit to our political system.       What if Boeing does it?     I mean, you know -       You think, no problem?       That's fine.     They're regulated.     That's the law, but the question says - what the question is directed at, given that that's the law, isn't the consequence of -- of this particular provision to sap the vitality of political parties and to encourage -- what should I say -- you know, drive-by PACs for each election?     Isn't -- isn't that the consequence?       I think we do.       You say -- you say it's $3.5 million.     If you assume somebody that gives the maximum to every possible candidate and party he can contribute to throughout the United States, 3.5 million. Just to put that in perspective, how much money is spent by political parties and PACs in all elections throughout the country -       -- in one election cycle?       Do you -- Do you have any idea much?       1.5 billion.       And what about PACs?       Oh, but that was a lot in the last few elections, wasn't it?       And -- and what about newspapers that -- that spend a lot of money in endorsing candidates and promoting their candidacy.     I suppose -- you know, you -- you have to put in that money, too.     That is money that is directed to political speech. When you add all that -- add -- when you add all that up, I don't think 3.5 million is a heck of a lot of money -       -- spread throughout the country.       General Verrilli, it seems to me -- it seems to me fanciful to think that the sense of gratitude that an individual senator or congressman is going to feel because of a substantial contribution to the Republican National Committee or Democratic National Committee is any greater than the sense of gratitude that that senator or congressman will feel to a PAC which is spending enormous amount of money in his district or in his State for his election. I mean, it seems to me the latter is much more identifiable, and there is nothing in the law that excludes that.     So apparently, that's not too much of a risk.       It is what it is, though.
12-547 +++$+++        He would have been able to raise it.     There's a lot of question about whether it would have been successful because, if it had gone up to the Michigan Supreme Court -- the statute was in effect during his first trial?       He could have raised it, but, if it went up to the Michigan Supreme Court, it would have had the same result as here.       And your only -- your only defense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise.     But I don't see how it's a surprise if the Michigan law has been, as -- as the Solicitor General of Michigan has described it, that -- that there's a clear tradition. If -- if the statute addresses the area, the courts will not -- will not supplement it by -- by common law additions. Did he not know that?       Why do you say it was firmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion by the solicitor general that there is no case which -- which acknowledged and held the defense of diminished capacity?       Is that wrong?       What -- what case -       -- lets the defendant off on the basis of diminished capacity?       What case has a holding - a holding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or mitigates the crime.       Or -- is that correct? Wouldn't -- wouldn't the supreme court have done that if it -- if it thought that at least -- at least it was arguable?       Mr. Mogill, as -- as I understand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to show that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you say it was; but it has to have been -       -- what you say it was.       And it -- there was an avulsive change by the supreme court.       It's -- it's hard to believe that, given -- given the clear text of the statute.       Now, if -- if a prosecutor raised that objection, knowing that the court of appeals would -- would reverse the exclusion, right -- I mean, it's clear what the court of appeals would have done, right?       And, once the court of appeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with that error, could -- could the defendant be retried?       Because he's -- he's convicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's -       That's right.       Could he be retried?       Well, then -- then you would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor.       But he could get an -- an interlocutory appeal on that?       Okay.       Was that -- how often was it mentioned in intermediate court opinions?       Four mentions in the supreme court that say what?       Yes.       Have we ever held that a State law has been determined to be X, simply because intermediate State courts have uniformly held it to be X?     Never mind assumed it to be X, have held it to be X?       It doesn't mean it's right.       You have to show it's right.       That it's the law.
12-562 +++$+++        But it doesn't just say partnership items.     Yes, "A court in which jurisdiction a petition is filed shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items."     But then it goes on, "The proper allocation of such items among the partners and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item."       What -- what can that possibly mean when you're talking about the applicability of any penalty?       That penalty is going to be applicable at the partner stage.       So what?       But it is in addition to partnership item.     You say, oh, you can't do that because it would add to partnership item.     But the statute does not say "just partnership item."     It says "partnership items, the proper allocation of such items, and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount."       It's in addition to partnership items.       And -- and it's -- it seems to me, not enough to say, well, if you interpret that third part to go beyond partnership items, you're destroying the statute.     I don't think so.       When would you not have to do that, if you are applying the third item, "the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to adjustment to a partnership"?       That will always require you to go down to the partner level.       Couldn't the government have pursued this, instead of saying -- you know, it's a sham partnership, just -- just -- couldn't the government simply have said that the partnership overstated its basis?       Now, I have a second question, which I asked your friend as well.     Is he correct that, if we rule for you, each partner may have a different result because different courts will find this to be a sham or not to be a sham?       Well, but why -- why wouldn't -- couldn't one court say I don't think it's a sham partnership?       I didn't get the question. If -- if what was -
12-574 +++$+++       They didn't really injure a person in State B here.    I mean, these people were in Georgia when the injury occurred.      So you're really arguing for a very broad principle.    Whenever there is an intentional tort, you can be haled into court at the place of residence of the person against whom the tort is committed.      No, that's what I thought you were saying.      Was the money here in Georgia the whole time?      Was it still there in that locker?      Well, you could say that about whatever rule we adopt.    Once we adopt the rule, when -- the defendant will know that if he violates that rule, he's going to be hailed into court.      I mean, it's sort of a self-fulfilling point you're making.      But you are libeled wherever it is published.    You don't have to be there where it's published.    You are libeled wherever it is published.      So -- so you could say that Calder, far from being an expansive decision, was a narrowing decision.    It said, you know, there's jurisdiction not necessarily everywhere where the libel was published, which is where the injury occurs, but there is jurisdiction only in California, where these other connections exist.      Except it's harder for you to establish that the injury occurred in Nevada.      But our jurisdiction cases have not been based on where you expected to be sued. You could expect to be sued anywhere if the State says you are going to be sued here. Our cases have focused on whether the State has jurisdiction, whether the State has enough connection with it to assert its power; not the expectation of the defendant, but the power of the State.    That's what's going on here.      That's your new test, just whether you could expect this to happen?
12-609 +++$+++        But Kansas decided the constitutional question, and we can't send it back unless we reverse the Supreme Court of Kansas.     So you say we're going to dodge the constitutional question? How can we?     I think it has been decided by the Kansas Supreme Court.       On what basis can we vacate?     We can't vacate a decision, unless there's something wrong with it.     What's wrong with it?       That's -- that's error?     I mean, I understand it's general policy you don't reach a constitutional question unless you have to, but I've never heard of the proposition that, if a court unnecessarily reaches a constitutional question, it can be reversed, that we can send it back and say, don't reach the constitutional question.       I don't think so.     Kansas decided the constitutional question.     We took the case in order to decide that, and I think we have to decide it.       Of course, there is nothing unusual about saying, if the defendant introduces certain evidence, he has to forfeit some of his Fifth Amendment self-incrimination rights.       It happens every time the defendant chooses to testify.       He need not testify, but if he introduces that evidence, he must submit to cross-examination and has to incriminate himself.     And this is, it seems to me, quite similar.     He need not introduce the evidence of the psychiatrist, but if he does, he has to forfeit his Fifth Amendment right not to talk to a psychiatrist.       I understand that.     But it's still -- it's still the same -- the same correlative system playing -       That the defendant does one thing, he has to accept what goes along with it, and that includes waiving or forfeiting his -- his right not to incriminate himself.       That's not getting into the defendant's mind.       It's only the psychiatrist who can get into the defendant's mind when he is -- when he is raising a mental capacity defense.       When you say as the price for putting on his defense, you mean as the price for introducing the testimony of a psychological expert?       No defendant can introduce any psychiatric evidence.     That's a good deal for the prosecution.
12-62 +++$+++        I disagree with all that, by the way. (Laughter.)       I assume that the statute is one that permits 10 days, right?   It's sort of an unusual statute, but, if the hypothetical is in the real world, the statute provides -- you know, 10 days to life, okay? And the judge thinks 10 days is okay.     I think that's the hypothetical.       I think you are saying it doesn't matter if they are advisory --       It is reversible error, is it not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without considering the factors in 3553?     That's reversible, isn't it?       Mr. Feigin, I'm under the impression -- more than the impression I know -- that the Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the guidelines retroactive. Can it only do that for revisions that -- that lower the -- the suggested penalty?     Or can it do that for revisions that increase it as well?       Only for lower, okay.       Because, if it could increase it, then it would be violating, according to your -- your friend, the Ex Post Facto Clause.
12-682 +++$+++        Why -- why doesn't the Fourth Amendment violate the rule you're saying -- or the 14th Amendment violate the rule that you're proposing?     I mean, I'm -- I'm a minority and I want laws that favor my minority.     Not just in university; everywhere.     My goodness, I can't have that through the normal legislative process.     I have to get a constitutional amendment to do it, right?       Well, so I guess -- I guess that on this subject of equal treatment of the races, we can eliminate racism just at the -- at the legislative level, can't we?       And you can't change those rules by normal legislation, correct?       So if you're a minority that wants favored treatment, you're just out of luck.       No, but the constitutional amendment is not the ordinary political process.       It's not a racial classification.     You should not refer to it that way.       It's the prohibition of racial classifications.       Every prohibition of racial classification is itself a racial classification?       Well, if that's how you're using racial classification, I thought it meant, you know, it's directed at blacks or Asians -       -- or -- no.     In that sense, the 14th Amendment itself is a racial classification, right?       In that sense, the 14th Amendment itself is a racial classification, no?       My goodness, I thought we've -- we've held that the 14th Amendment protects all races.     I mean, that was the argument in the early years, that it protected only -- only the blacks.     But I thought we rejected that.     You -- you say now that we have to proceed as though its purpose is not to protect whites, only to protect minorities?       Right.       And unless that exists, the 14th Amendment is not violated, is that right?     So if you have a banding together of various minority groups who discriminate against -- against whites, that's okay?       Do you have any case of ours that propounds that view of the 14th Amendment, that it protects only minorities?     Any case?       Your opponent says otherwise.     He says that minority students have taken tougher courses, they have been better qualified to be admitted, and all sorts of other benefits.     So it's certainly a debatable question.       You're changing your answer, then.     Your answer to the Chief was it does depend and now you are saying it doesn't depend on whether it benefits minorities at all, it's just whether it places a -- a greater burden on minorities to change it.     Which is it?       One or the other?
12-696 +++$+++       And atheists.    Throw in atheists, too. (Laughter.)      What about devil worshippers? (Laughter.)      Your point is that it coerces, it's bad because it coerces?      If there is -- if coercion is the test of the Free Exercise Clause, why do we need a Free Exercise Clause?    If there's coercion -- I'm sorry -- of the Establishment Clause, why do we need the Establishment Clause?    If there's coercion, I assume it would violate the Free Exercise Clause, wouldn't it?      So it seems to me very unlikely that the test for the Establishment Clause is identical to the test for the Free Exercise Clause.      This is coercion?    He says, you know -- he says, "May we pray," and somebody doesn't want to pray, so he stays seated.      Mr. Laycock, it seems to me that you're missing here is -- and this is what distinguishes legislative prayer from other kinds -- the people who are on the town board or the representatives who are in Congress, they're citizens.    They are there as citizens.    The judges here are not -- we're not here as citizens.    And as citizens, they bring, they bring to their job all of -- all of the predispositions that citizens have. And these people perhaps invoke the deity at meals.    They should not be able to invoke it before they undertake a serious governmental task such as enacting laws or ordinances? There is a serious religious interest on the other side of this thing that -- that -- that people who have religious beliefs ought to be able to invoke the deity when they are acting as citizens, and not -- not as judges or as experts in -- in the executive branch. And it seems to me that when they do that, so long as all groups are allowed to be in, there seems to me -- it seems to me an imposition upon them to -- to stifle the manner in which they -- they invoke their deity.      You want to pick the groups we're going to exclude?      The Baha'i, who else? These -- these groups are too small to --      Yeah, the atheists are out already.      Okay.    So who else?    I mean, you suggest -- you say just the vast majority is all that we have to cater to.      Okay.    Good.    Got that. Number 1, atheists.    Who else?      Well, that's -- that's - that's really part of the issue, whether they're undertaking a government function or whether they're acting as citizens in a legislative body, representative of the people who bring -- who bring to that their - their own personal beliefs. I think the average person who -- who -- who participates in a legislative prayer does not think that this is a governmental function.    It's a personal function.    And -- and that's why we separate out the legislative prayer from other kinds of prayers.      If you had an atheist board, you would not have any prayer.      I guarantee you, because it is a personal prayer that the members of the legislature desire to make.      That's not a prayer. That's not a prayer.      "How many of you have been saved?"    That's not a prayer.
12-71 +++$+++        And enclosing your driver's license number is that immense barrier, right?       That's what's keeping 40 percent of eligible voters away?       I still think that's a relatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the driver's license, then you can use your naturalization certificate.       Well, you can say that about any certification procedure that, now and then there will be a mistake.     I mean the fact that there is one person where -- where the computer spit out the wrong number or something, that is the basis for rejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes?       Is that conclusive or can that be challenged?       Excuse me, they may require it.     It doesn't say they must require it.     So it leaves it open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to Page 38 require some materials that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility?     Isn't that -- isn't that what the language means?       May means may.       No, no, no, we're talking about -- right now we are talking about the consequences of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may is may.     It does not even require the Commission to include within the form everything that's necessary for the State to determine eligibility. Now, why would Congress ever create such a system where the Commission need not require what's necessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State cannot, cannot require anything further than what the Commission says?       It says what you only may require.     It doesn't say what you only shall require.       Is all that stuff required by the Vote America Act?     All that stuff?       Just the first thing you mentioned for us.       And the rest is -- is what?       Not anything else that they want.     Not anything else that they want.     But what is, in the words of the statute, necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant?     It's clear that the statute intends the States to be able to do that.     And you say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has -- has required its -- its own proof and the State wants a different kind of proof.     The proof the Commission requires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen.     This is proof?       This is not proof at all.       Under oath is not proof at all.     It's just a statement.       Mr. Srinivasan, the problem that I have with that is that the provision you're alluding to says that -- not that the State shall  not Page 52 that the commission "shall" require the information necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that it "may" require only that information.     Now, is it conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission may not require some information that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but that the State may not require it either? Is that a conceivable disposition of Congress?       You think "may require only" means shall require only?     Is that -- is that your submission?     "May require only" means shall require only?       It would not be a problem if the State could require it.     It would not be a problem.     When -- when the commission fails to do what -- what enables the State to assess qualifications, the State will do it.     No problem.       Yes.     And since you believe that "may require only" means "shall require only," in judicial review, the determination before the -- the Court would be whether indeed this information is necessary to enable the State to assess the qualifications, right?       And the district court here certainly thought that was necessary.     So you're going to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to Page 57 be -- the next time somebody does challenge the Commission determination in court under the Administrative Procedure Act.       You got to stop saying the Commission approved of it.     2-2 is not approving.     You could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.       I'm sorry.     I'm sorry.
12-729 +++$+++        They don't have to provide benefits at all, do they?       And if they do, they do it on their own terms.       Why wouldn't equitable tolling apply if you don't have enough time to prepare the court suit?     You have just a month, let's say, and it's not your fault because you pursued the administrative proceedings vigorously and promptly.     Why wouldn't it be?       So these seven people, nine people -- how many were there?     Over 40 years, they probably had a way out?       Do you have any position on whether the executive can prescribe when -- when suit must be brought?       They're not going to do this for a lobby of nine people, are they?       I thought that this contract required exhaustion of administrative remedies before you can sue.     Isn't that in the contract?       So it's not a judge-created doctrine.       I mean, we create it in other instances where -- where there are agency, you know, requirements to go through the agency, and we - we make it up.     But here it's -- it's in the contract, isn't it?       So we are not as entitled to fiddle with it as much as we are when it is our creation, I suppose.
12-751 +++$+++ 
12-7515 +++$+++       So Congress -- Congress supposedly knew that and -- and could have written a statute so that you're -- you're liable if you are a contributing cause of -- of the death.    It didn't do so. It said -- it says it has to result in the death. And -- and I take that to mean at least, at least but-for causality.      Why -- why should "result in" not -- not mean but-for causality?      Why?      Why -- why does "result in" refer -- refer to what -- what we do in the common law? I mean, I apply common law rules when -- when Congress adopts a common law crime, yes.    It -- it brings along the -- the soil that goes with that crime, right?    But this is not a common law crime, and -- and Congress used the English language "results in," and I would take that to mean causes.      It depends on what you mean by substantial.      Opposing counsel says substantial means that it would independently have sufficed.      If that's what you mean by it, we'll all cheer.    But -- but I suspect that's not what you mean.      That's not what was found in this case, right?      That -- that's what you call a substantial factor?    That all contributed to the outcome?    The one grain of heroin would -- would -      Well, then -- then you don't agree with that -- that stuff that you just read point.      Well, what is substantial? What do you think is substantial?    10 percent, 20 percent -      5 percent, what?      I agree with you the language -- their position now is not that it's enough that it's an important factor.    Rather, and I would like to know your view on this, your opposing counsel contends that the courts and commentators who use the "substantial factor" terminology mean by "a substantial factor" a factor that would by itself have been sufficient.      Because of that imprecision, some poor devils will have to go to jail for a longer period than otherwise, you know.    Tough luck.

Contractual obligation, whether only those two at common law would apply to strict liability torts. There's disagreement on that point. If you're absolutely clear that that's what the 0 common law did, but I don't think that's what the common law did.   Not for strict liability torts   What does -- what does (b) require? Does it require inducing an infringement or inducing an infringer?
12-79 +++$+++        Well, wait.     And -- and if that's -- if that's wrong, you acknowledge you don't win?       All right.     Okay.     So what difference does it make?       And you really don't agree with that anyway.
12-794 +++$+++    It doesn't demonstrate anything of the sort. It just means that he didn't object.   Maybe he was a very bad lawyer. Who knows? We're -- we're going to determine our law on the basis of whether a government lawyer made an objection or not?   At most, it shows that he didn't think that there was anything wrong with it. Does that mean we have to think there was nothing wrong with it?   Okay.   He's trying to help you, counsel.   What about remorse? Wasn't remorse at issue?   Well, whatever. I mean, the jury doesn't have to take that into account. Isn't it one of -- one of the factors?   Right.   It is, but you have to go beyond saying I believe that. What you have to say to prevail here is, not only do I believe it, but no reasonable juror -- no reasonable jurist could possibly believe otherwise. Now, do you want to say that?   No reasonable jurors could say otherwise?   And you think that made the difference, that the jury would not have condemned your client to death, had it not been for the fact that they drew an adverse inference from -- they knew all the horrific details of the crime. They had heard all of your mitigating evidence. And you think what -- what tipped the balance -- or at least we think it plausibly could have tipped the balance, is -- is this failure to give the no-adverse inference instruction?   Really?   Well, what

It seems an awfully -- awful waste of counsel's time and client's money to be litigating about which court you ought to be in, and it seems to me to avoid that, the lines ought to be clear.    And it doesn't seem to me that the line, you know, whether there is a significant State interest involved or not, is a clear line.    You can argue about that in almost any case.    So I'm disinclined to use that kind of a -- of a test along with any others. Why can't we just limit -- limit Younger abstention to the three categories discussed in NOPSI, and say, that's it; no more?      Any purely civil case that raises that kind of an issue can arguably be subject to Younger abstention; is that right?
12-820 +++$+++    I think they had it in mind, not just the interest of children, but the interest of parents. It's simply not true that, in all cases involving children, the paramount interest of the child governs. That's not the case, or else, we would remove many children from their parents in this country.   Parents have rights.   And that is one of the things that this treaty considers.   Justice Sotomayor is from New York.   I think your answer to Justice Kagan's question has to be no, or else I don't understand what we're doing here.   But you say -- I don't understand what you're saying. Give us an example.   You just don't want to say no. It seems to me your case requires you to say no, and it's no help to me to say, well -- you know, there may be some exceptions that I can't describe. Tell me the exceptions if there are any.   Yes.   Under 13, right? Is that the discretion you're talking about?   And I  I assumed from your brief that that was not the reading you were giving it. And that is not the reading it has to be given, frankly. I read it the other way, "shall order the return unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled." I assume that to mean in which case you shall not order the return. Isn't that the way you've been reading it?   Oh, it is not. Okay. Well, then, gee, we don't have a lot to argue about here.   Of course.   Ms. Moskowitz, what do you do about Article 13 in that case, which begins, "notwithstanding the provisions of" Article -- "of the preceding Article 12, the judicial or administrative authority requesting is not bound to order the return of the child if the person" -- blah, blah, blah. That says to me that, under 12, you are bound, and you're telling me, well, you're really not bound under 12. You have discretion anyway.   I, frankly, didn't understand that that was your argument in this case, and it -- it puts the whole case in a quite different light.   What's the government's position on -- on this question we've just been discussing, whether Article 12 is absolute or whether there is discretion even within Article 12, even though specific elements of discretion are contained in Article 13?   Why doesn't the context include Section 13, which -- which lists specific reasons why you can depart from 12? I mean, it seems very strange to say, and in addition to that, there's a whole pot load of other reasons within -- within 12 itself.   You would expect all the signatories to this treaty to come up with essentially the same exceptions, under -- under what you say is -- is the interpretation of Article 12?   I mean, it seems to me it just makes that article impossible to apply consistently country to country.   Have they exercised it have they exercised it, that discretion which they say is there?   Have they exercised that discretion not to apply the -- the mandatory requirement of Article 12?   I'm talking about foreign courts.   There's always -- isn't there always abduction? As your friend has pointed out, the whole treaty only applies where the child has been abducted, so you say, oh, well, there's a special exception to the rules of the treaty where the child has been abducted, but that's what the treaty applies to.   You know, I have one more question. At the end of the day, now that I understand the government's position, I don't see any difference between your position and -- and the position of -- of the Petitioner here, except that he wants to call it equitable tolling, and you want to say we can take concealment into account under Section 12 --   -- and not apply the absolute rule, where there's been concealment. I don't care whether you call it equitable tolling or not.
12-842 +++$+++    Well, that makes it a lot harder for me because I thought you just looked to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. And anything that is executable in this country under that, you can get information on to try to execute abroad. But you are saying, oh, no, it's more than that, it's stuff that you couldn't execute on in this country, but that some foreign countries will let you execute on. What am I supposed to do, look at the law of all of these countries?   So it includes military assets, diplomatic assets, everything?   Military assets?   No. I'm saying it is within the scope. It does -- it is those limited military assets that you cannot execute on in this country. And you are saying, well, so long as we can do it abroad, we --   Let's assume -- let's assume that New York has an exemption from -- from levying on property. It says homestead, you can't levy on homestead. But Florida does not have that exemption. Can you, getting a judgment in a New York State court, seek to discover what homestead property the defendant has elsewhere?   Come on. I'm doing the hypothetical, okay? And my hypothetical is the discovery is what homes do you own in other states?   The same language as the New York statute --   -- which exempts those homes.   Okay?   And you think you can levy on those homes --   -- in Florida even though New York wouldn't let you do it?   It's a judgment limited to property other than homesteads. You take that judgment to Florida, it doesn't expand. It's the same judgment.   But not from -- not from homesteads.   When you say you can't execute on homestead property, it means any judgment in New York excludes homesteads.
12-8561 +++$+++    Yes. Well, now -- not because tort law has developed that, I mean, I frankly don't agree with what you say modern tort law is supposed to allow, and -- and Keeton -- you know, doesn't really establish that that's what the courts now do. But even without agreeing with that, can't I find that that is the system that this statute intended to impose? I mean, we're dealing here with a question of statutory interpretation. So the question is not what does modern tort law allow, but the question is what, reasonably, could Congress have meant by this statute?   Because I'm not going to go along with you on -- you know, modern tort law. I think that's nonsense. I don't think it's true.   Well, you don't deny but-for. I haven't understood your submission to be that there need not be but-for cause here.   Well, you're -- you're confusing whether there's a specific amount of harm caused with whether it is easy to measure that harm. The -- the tort cases you refer to are cases in which there is a result produced that is not severable. You can't say this person is -- you know, accounts for this much of it, such as pollution, all the pollution there. The stream is polluted. That's quite different from this case where -- where this -- this young woman has been subjected to psychological harm because of thousands of people viewing her rape. Now, this -- she would be subjected to less psychological harm if it was just one person or ten people or a hundred people. In other words, each person increases the amount of her psychological harm. It is severable the way the tort cases you refer to are not. And so why shouldn't the question in this case be simply he caused a certain incremental amount of psychological harm to -- to this woman and he should pay for it and it's up to the district court to decide what the proper amount of that payment ought to be.   I understand.   But they're certainly not using your theory. Even though it's not plucked out of the air, they're certainly not using your theory.  Yes. So they're using some theory.   And you have no idea what that is and can't suggest one, right?   And that's wonderful and -- you know, I -- I want to go along with you. This is a bad guy, and -- and he ought to be punished, and he ought to give restitution, but there is such a thing as due process of law. And what you're saying is -- I have no idea how much he's going to be required to turn over, whether it's going to be -- what was it in this case, $3 million?   I have no idea what he's going to be socked with, and that's not what we usually do with criminal statutes.   You just can't say leave it up to the district judge -- you know, and they all come out different ways, but who cares, it's -- you know, so long as it's within some --   Well, Justice Scalia -- -- some reasonable amount. Post Booker -- That's just not the way we do law.   That's because the statute says so. It says you get from -- you know, 10 to 20 years, okay? But the statute here doesn't say -- you know, you'll -- you'll get between this and this, whatever the district judge likes. It doesn't say that. It says you -- you should compensate the victim for what -- for what you've caused her.   We have a fudge factor here? Can a -- can a district judge use what he calls a fudge factor -- this is a criminal statute. It's not a tort case.   We're going to be liable for a fudge factor. (Laughter.)   He had two pictures. He did not distribute at all. He was not a distributor, right?   He was just convicted of possessing two pictures. And -- and the statute doesn't even require intentional possession, just knowing possession, right? He could have gotten them by accident. He knew he got them, but he never took them off of his computer, but he's still guilty of the crime. So I -- he's guilty -- he's guilty of the crime. But to sock him for all of her -- all of her psychiatric costs and everything else because he had two pictures of her? Congress couldn't have intended that.   Like Justice Sotomayor and like the government here, I think, even if there is a proximate cause requirement, it has been -- it has been met, once you adopt the aggregate offense notion. But I wanted to ask you about Subsection (F). My -- it doesn't seem to me that you -- whether or not you read the proximate cause element in (F) into (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), it seems to me what you have to read into (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) is the portion of (F) which says, "any other losses suffered by the victim as a result of the offense." "Of the offense." Is it only (F) that is limited to the particular offense, and (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) means those -- those items that come from anybody else's conviction?   So he should contribute to the payment. You're saying he contributed to the harm, but he makes 100 percent of the payment. That doesn't seem to me to make much sense.   They don't say from that person.   This is subsequent legislative history? Is that what this is?   Even those that like legislative history don't like subsequent legislative history. (Laughter.)
12-872 +++$+++        Yeah, but that's not what the Seventh Circuit held.     I mean, that -- that may well be, but we're asked to review a holding by the Seventh Circuit that, even if you aren't covered, even if you're not exempt, you still have a 1983 claim.     That's - that's why we took this case. And now, you're -- you're telling us we should not review what the Seventh Circuit held.     And that would, presumably, remain the circuit law, right?       Counsel, I'm trying to - trying to see how -- how many of these arguments that you have made before us about why -- why we can't get to the holding of the Seventh Circuit, how many of them you made in your brief in opposition.     I mean, we -- we don't like to dismiss a case as improvidently granted, and -       -- only when the -- when the case is before us, counsel suddenly finds all sorts of reasons why we shouldn't have taken it in the first place.     You should have told us that before we took it.       Well, I read your brief in opposition as -- as going exclusively to what your unfortunate brother barely had a chance to argue; that is, the merits of the case.     That -- that's what your brief in opposition addressed, and here, we end up spending most of our discussion on -- on other stuff. I -- I don't -- I don't like to encourage that.
12-873 +++$+++    How do you -- how do you sguare that with the statutory provision that the purpose of the law is to prevent unfair competition? Unfair competition, not unfair trade practices. Unfair competition.   Did you answer his guestion? I'm still left with a lack of understanding of how the disparagement of the -- of the composite product is automatically a disparagement of your chip.   I am, too, because I'm sick of it.   I understand. But why should it be "arguably"? "Arguably"? I mean, under the APA, you are dealing with suits against the government, and it's just funny money at issue. But, when you have private suits, you can drag somebody into court simply because you are arguably within the zone of interest protected? I'm not happy with that.   It isn't whether the interest is reasonable. It's -- it's whether it was the type of interest that the statute sought to protect. And -- and the term "zone of interest" is a better expression of that concept, it seems to me, than "reasonable interest." I mean -- you know, that's my objection to the reasonable interest test.   That may be better   "Arguably" could refer to factual matters; that is, you -- you are within the zone of interest if certain facts are established. And, if you don't establish those facts, you are not. That's how I've always understood the "arguably." I don't think it means -- you know, "close enough for government work." It doesn't mean that. It means you -- you are within the zone of interest if, indeed, these facts that you have asserted exist.
12-895 +++$+++       Why -- why do you say - you say in context, it was okay.    What -- what context?      That's it?    Just that?    "In order to aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that the defendant willfully and knowingly associated himself in some way with the crime."
12-9012 +++$+++    Yes, it's under --   -- 3664, which is quite a different thing.   You brought this in. JUSTICE BREYER. I brought in a certain   Well, why should the defendant here subsidize the banks playing the market? That's what you are saying.   The bank is playing the market. It says, yeah, we could sell it for so much now, but, yeah, it may go up. And you're saying that, you know, he's paying for the bank's roll of the dice.   Well, it's not just more complicated. It's a question of, I guess, who has the burden. As I understood, what you are proposing is you get the sale price, but it's -- it's available to the defendant to show that the sale price was unreasonably low because of gamesmanship on the part of the bank or some other reason, right?   Yes.   You would prefer that to the other formulation, wouldn't you?
12-929 +++$+++        Just volunteer witnesses? Are they just going to walk in the courtroom and say, I'd -- I'd would like to testify? (Laughter.)  or the other's, aren't they? Exactly. Surely, they're one side's  What kind of -- what kind of proceedings do they have there? (Laughter.)       Don't -- don't put me in the group that thinks you can use forum non conveniens. When -- when you have a forum selection clause for a State court and suit is brought -- attempted to be brought in a Federal court -- I mean, if it's in the Federal court, that is the most convenient court -- I mean, let's say it's in -- in a different State where all the witnesses are. I think it's very strange to say that, because there is a contract provision requiring it to be brought in a State court, this court is an inconvenient court.     I -- do you know that the doctrine of forum non conveniens has ever been used that way.       It should have been a Virginia court to make that decision, instead of your friendly, down home Texas court.     And that's -- you know, that was why the forum selection clause was put in there.     It doesn't seem to me such a stretch as you think it is to say that the venue is improper when you have agreed that venue would not lie in this Court.       So the -- the question is Is it improper when it's been waived?     Is it improper for a court to acknowledge venue when the party has - has said I -- I cannot -- I cannot bring my suit in this court.     I don't think it's a terrible stretch to -- to call that improper venue. However theoretical it may be, venue is - is decided by -- by statute, of course it is.     But people may waive it, and when people have waived it, I don't know that there's a great interest in -- in saying that, nonetheless, the venue remains proper. It seems to me you've given it away, and it ought to be -- it ought to be the -- the court where the parties agree that suit would lie that would decide these -- these change-of-venue questions. The provision need not be absolutely dispositive, but to the extent it isn't, that is a call that -- that ought to be made by the jurisdiction that the parties agreed to.     The whole litigation ought to begin there.     They shouldn't have to litigate this change of venue provision in a court where the parties agreed they would not appear. It seems to me terribly unfair.       Why is that?     Why is that? Why can't the Court, where you agreed to be sued, apply 1404?       I wish. (Laughter.)
12-930 +++$+++    But under  under her theory, the -- the petition is -- is still coming from the same person. Under yours, it would be coming from a different person. How can you -- how can you even know that that person now wants this -- this -- this new adult to come in, much less go ahead without a petition from that person?   You're going to file a petition in that person's name, without that person's consent?   And you're saying that this automatically gives the consent of that parent?   Well, you must be if it can automatically convert.   If I understand you, the -- the parent will be deemed to have filed a petition for admission of this now-adult, right?   And -- but the parent can withdraw that petition?   All of this flows from the word "automatic"?   Well, this is all upside down. I thought it's the Agency that we deferred to. If it can be read in the way the Agency wants, we affirm the Agency's position.   You're saying that that's not true, that if it can be read the way the court of appeals would like it to be read, we must affirm the court of appeals on it.   I never heard of that proposition.   That would depend entirely upon how much weight you want to give to the word "automatically." I frankly find it hard to think that all the things that you say are going to happen flow from the word "automatic." And once you have a more narrow view of automatically, it isn't -- your holistic argument does not carry the day, and you're left with an ambiguity that, it seems to me, we would defer to the Agency on, not -- not to the Ninth Circuit.   How can you possibly qualify for B, without qualifying for A? How can you retain your original priority if you have not been converted to another category?   That's quite impossible. The two are obviously conjunctive and not dysjunctive.   Well, all that proves is that you need either automatic conversion or the filing of a separate petition. But you obviously need either one or the other of those two --   -- before the -- the B part, "the alien shall retain the original priority," makes any sense.
12-9490 +++$+++    But not necessarily drunkenness. I think there -- there are a lot of people that get tickets for reckless driving who have not served jail terms for driving drunk. The two are far from synonymous.   And  and between the, what, 50 and 75 percent, they've stopped people without just cause.   Or they've  they've troubled people who shouldn't have been troubled.   Well, reckless driving always does, whether it -- whether it's the consequence of inebriation or not.   So a simple call saying, boy, this guy -- you know, he cut in, in front of me. He's changing lanes too frequently --   -- that -- that enables the policeman, without observing any of that reckless driving, to stop the car further down the road.   Of course, this call didn't say, I think the guy was drunk. It just said, somebody drove -- you know, drove me off the road.   Right? So this isn't  it isn't a call that says there's a drunken driver. It's just a call that says somebody drove irresponsibly, right? And that's enough to stop them.   Okay. Really irresponsibly, okay?   Really irresponsibly.   It wasn't a report of drunk driving.   Somebody ran me off the road. Somebody was driving really irresponsibly.   That's enough to stop him down the road.   What about cutting me off too quickly, you know?   Cuts right in front of me. Really ticks me off. (Laughter.)   I think it's an entirely different case if the tip -- if the tip here was -- you know, I was at a party, this guy got in his car, he should not have turned the key on in that car, this guy is really drunk, you should stop that car on the road. I think that's totally different from somebody just saying, this guy swerved, or this guy drove me off the road. You're -- you're just making the assumption that -- that every -- every one of those incidents demonstrates a drunk behind the wheel, and I just don't think that's true.   You don't think that a teenager standing on a street corner with a couple of other teenagers with a gun in his belt represents a threat to public safety?   No? All right.   Yeah, but that -- but that second danger -- you may have a drunken driver on the road; that danger can be eliminated by following the car. You don't have to stop the car right away. You can follow it and if, indeed, the driver seems to be driving erratically, then you can stop. You'd have probable cause. I don't think you have to automatically allow a stop in order to prevent all of the horribles that are going to arise from drunk driving. Follow the car. If he's behaving like a drunk driver, then stop him.   That is so remote. I mean, it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a broad rule that is contrary to what we normally do for searches and seizures because, now and then, it would seem, to me, very rarely, before the police can stop the drunk driver, he kills somebody. I mean, I suppose that could happen now and then but it's pretty fanciful.
12-96 +++$+++        That will always be true forever into the future.     You could always say, oh, there has been improvement, but the only reason there has been improvement are these extraordinary procedures that deny the States sovereign powers, which the Constitution preserves to them.     So, since the only reason it's improved is because of these procedures, we must continue those procedures in perpetuity.       Is that the argument you are making?       I thought that was the argument you were just making.       That's a different argument.       Hundreds?     Hundreds? Dozens?     What.       Right.       Well, maybe it was making that judgment, Mr. Verrilli.     But that's -- that's a problem that I have.     This Court doesn't like to get involved in -- in racial questions such as this one. It's something that can be left -- left to Congress. The problem here, however, is suggested by the comment I made earlier, that the initial enactment of this legislation in a -- in a time when the need for it was so much more abundantly clear was -- in the Senate, there -- it was double-digits against it.     And that was only a 5-year term. Then, it is reenacted 5 years later, again for a 5-year term.     Double-digits against it in the Senate.     Then it was reenacted for 7 years.     Single digits against it.     Then enacted for 25 years, 8 Senate votes against it. And this last enactment, not a single vote in the Senate against it.     And the House is pretty much the same.     Now, I don't think that's attributable to the fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this. I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.     It's been written about.     Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes. I don't think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act. And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless -- unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.     You have to show, when you are treating different States differently, that there's a good reason for it. That's the -- that's the concern that those of us who -- who have some questions about this statute have.     It's -- it's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress.     There are certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now.     And even the Virginia Senators, they have no interest in voting against this.     The State government is not their government, and they are going to lose -- they are going to lose votes if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act. Even the name of it is wonderful:     The Voting Rights Act.     Who is going to vote against that in the future?       We looked behind it in Boerne.     I'm not talking about dismissing it.     I'm -- I'm talking about looking at it to see whether it makes any sense.       But that's true in every State, isn't it?       I mean -- you know, I don't think anybody is contesting that it's more effective if you use Section 5.     The issue is why just in these States.     That's it.       Do you think all of the noncovered States are worse in that regard than the nine covered States, is that correct?       Every -- every one of them is worse.       It's not just a fair one, it's the crucial question.     Congress has selected these nine States.     Now, is there some good reason for selecting these nine?
12-98 +++$+++        Yes, but that doesn't answer the question.     I mean that portion, according to North Carolina, is one-third.       Yes, but what the State says is the law.     I mean, the State says one-third is for medical.       So you need, ultimately you need an adjudication.     You have to leave it either to a jury to decide what percentage of the total award is -- is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding. Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really for medical.     You know, they may say 10 percent is, but who believes that?     You -- you need a proceeding. That is awfully time-consuming.     And -- and as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be very accurate.     I don't think a jury determination is going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score. And I don't know how you go about determining how much of a settlement is attributable to -- to medical expenses versus other things, especially when the settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical expenses.       How do you do that?       I don't understand.     What do you adjudicate?     What is the issue in the adjudication?     How much of the award should have been allocated to medical expenses, or how much of the award was, in fact, allocated to medical expenses?     Which is the issue?       It seems to me it should be the latter, shouldn't it?       That's right.     How much was allocated, right?     It doesn't matter what ought to have been.     The issue is what proportion did the parties in fact allocate to medical expenses, right?       And they say 1 penny.     How are you going to contradict that?       No, no.     But that's --       You know, putting -- putting it in the discretion of the court, as you say is done in the workmen's compensation, is quite different from what you're proposing here.     That seems to me quite workable -- you know.     The -- the court hears the evidence and he decides how much should be reimbursed within -- within the court's discretion.     But here, you're -- you're asking a court to decide how much of a recovery or how much of a settlement was attributable to -- to the medical portion.       That's a totally different question.       But it would be the defendant who's -- who's -- who's jiggering the system, I mean, not suing for the medical portion simply because the defendant knows that at least some of that portion, if not all of it, would -- would go -- would go to the State.     So, in a situation, such as yours, where the total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed.     And that seems to me a real, I don't know, gaming -- gaming of the system.       Excuse me.     I have a -- I have a theoretical problem right at the outset.     I mean, what the statute forbids is asserting a lien on recovery that is for medical expenses.     And you're telling me that the States aren't even trying to find out what portion of the recovery was for medical expenses. They're looking to determine what proportion should have been for medical expenses. How does that tie in with the -- with the prohibition of the lien?       So -- so you're saying that the State can, in making this determination, in fact take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by determining how much should have been allocated to medical expenses, right?       So you're messing up the lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it.       I'm not sure that HHS has -- has authority over -- over how a State recovers. I don't see that it's part of the administration of the statute committed to HHS.     So I -- you know, I admire you're not citing Chevron. (Laughter.)
12-99 +++$+++       Mr. Messenger, could - could all of these things that the employer gave to the union be included in a finally-negotiated collective bargaining agreement?    Couldn't that CBA say that the union shall have the ability to approach employees on the site, that the union shall have access to the employee list of the employer -- and what else, what's the third -- and that the employer will not -- will not seek to undermine the union?    Could all of that be included in a CBA?      Yes.    And I suppose -- I suppose that would also -- it would also follow if - if -- with no indication in the text, you simply exclude organizing -- the organizing part of labor law.    I guess it would mean that the -- the union can cut a deal with the employer that if the employer gives them a freehand and -- and assists them in -- in organizing, the union will promise not to -- not to seek a raise in wages or not to seek insurance coverage or whatever.    I guess that would also be part of the organizing campaign, right, so it would be okay.      Well, benefits -- benefits to the employees always benefit the union.    I mean, that's -- you know, that's automatic, it seems to me.    I don't understand how you say that this is just a gift statute and there doesn't have to be any, anything on the other side, no quid pro quo.    You say it's perfectly okay if the -- if the employer allows the union to come on his premises to recruit members, but it's not okay for him to agree, to agree to do so?      I don't understand what that means.      And what if the employer does not oppose the union, he neither speaks against it nor for it?    Is that giving something of value to the union?      It has no meaning to say you agree to something when you're not getting anything in return.    You can promise something without getting anything in return.    But to agree?    I think that means, you know, I won't do it in exchange for something else.      But if it did happen, you'd say it would be a violation.
12-992 +++$+++    Mr. Feldman, what about -- what about a statute that says the plaintiff shall recover, as part of his damages, attorneys' fees? What do we do with that, for purposes of 1291?   Absolutely clearly?   So it is clear, is it not, that the criterion is not whether it is part of damages?   Because, if that were the criterion, Budinich would have come out the other way.   Essentially, it doesn't matter whether it's merits or nonmerits.   For purposes of -- for purposes of this rule.   I don't know how else you can read it.   "As a general matter." But -- but the case acknowledges that that's not always true, and the holding says it doesn't matter when it's not true, they will still be treated as -- as separate, even though they are damages, we're not going to treat them as damages.   Yes, but Budinich acknowledged that some of these fees are not costs. It acknowledged that.   I don't understand the difference between "deeming" and "being." When the statute deems it to be costs, they are costs. They are costs.   But we said in Budinich that they are costs, even when the statute makes clear that they are damages. I mean, we're saying it doesn't matter what the statute says, and I don't see why it should matter what the contract says.   I don't want to have to go through this in every case.   Okay. So limit it to attorneys' fees, as the rule does. That's a pretty clear line. Attorneys' fees -- you know, you -- you have to file right away. Anything else, it can extend.   I don't care about this case, frankly. I care about the rule that we're going to be adopting.   I wouldn't be saying that. I would be saying there's attorneys' fees and there's stuff other than attorneys' fees. Merits doesn't matter.   Well, if they're worried about it, they could always appeal and withdraw the appeal later.   If they -- if they don't get the amount, right?   Are you -- are you sure that, as a general matter, contractual provisions do not make attorneys' fees costs? I've seen a lot of contracts that say -- you know, shall recover costs including -- including attorneys' fees.
13-115 +++$+++    Counsel, do you acknowledge that -- that the issue here is whether the law was clearly established? Do you agree with that?   I'm not saying whether you believe it is. Is that the -- if you find it wasn't clearly established, do you lose, is what I'm saying?   Okay. Now, how can it be clearly established if we have never held that there is a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation? We've never held that, have we? How can you possibly say that the violation here is clearly established.   Oh, it is pernicious. But is there a Bivens action for it? The Constitution does not create a cause of action for this. 1983 doesn't cover this. We invented it out of -- really out of nothing, and we have not extended that to First Amendment violations up to now.   Well, regardless of whether it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument that was made below and here, that the violation here was not clearly established.   Well, okay.   That's a good point.   That's a good point.   You're the farthest thing from a security expert if you don't know the answer to that one. (Laughter.)   I don't think the government has conceded that.   I don't think the government conceded that at all.   Excuse me. I'm not sure. If you stop a car because you think the participants in it were coming back from a protest against President Bush, is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case, if that's your allegation? The only reason the car was stopped was because of the viewpoint that these people have. Is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case?   Yeah, I would think so. And you think that so long as you make that First Amendment allegation, it doesn't matter if you have a broken taillight.   Wow.   You might get only limited discovery, but --
13-132 +++$+++    I think he inverted two and three, but --   But you're not willing to limit -- you're not willing to limit your position to searches that either are in order to protect the officer or in order to preserve evidence or, number three, in order to find evidence of the crime of arrest. You're not willing to limit it that way? You would say whatever is on the person, you can -- you can search.   But that gets you into the arrest for, you know, for not wearing a seat belt, and it seems absurd that you should be able to search that person's iPhone. And you can avoid that if you -- if you say, look, in the vast majority of cases, this is not going to be a problem, unless the officer can reasonably be looking for evidence of the crime of arrest. That will cover the bad cases, but it won't cover the -- you know, the seat belt arrest.
13-193 +++$+++    Well, but the criminal prosecution isn't all that they're complaining about. They're complaining about having -- having to be dragged through this same -- this same proceeding next time in the midst of an election campaign, and however minimal the finding that is ultimately made may be, they are going to be subject, for sure, to that proceeding in the next election campaign. And I don't care if all the commission says is, you know, there is some reason to believe that they were lying. Even if it's that minimal, you are forcing them, and it is pretty sure that it's going to happen because somebody will complain, the candidate they are criticizing, you are forcing them to go through this procedure in the midst of an election campaign, right?   Their organization is not an anti-Driehaus -- is that his name, "Driehaus"?   That's not what they are about. They are about opposition to the abortion funding portion of the Affordable Care Act and they're going to make the same, the same contentions against anybody else who runs for office who has voted for that Act, whether it's Driehaus or anybody else.   The mere fact that a private individual can chill somebody's speech does not say, well, since a private individual can do it, you know, the ministry of truth can do it. That's not -- that's not the law.   Yeah, what? I can't understand what that would be. It has to be really false. Is that it? (Laughter.)   Do you think that the allegedly false statement here was a false statement of fact?   There's a good argument on the other side. But it's an argument over a fact, isn't it, whether this person was responsible for the Affordable Care Act. I mean that was the charge, you know, that this person made the decisive vote, right, in the --   But by voting -- by voting for that Act.   Yes.   You  you make the statement, and then, you know, you can litigate it on the basis of whatever the Ohio Supreme Court says. Right?   I mean, let's litigate whether it's factually inaccurate or legally inaccurate, right? It's a lawsuit.   Yes, we are. But I mean, we're talking about whether this law imposes limitations upon the freedom of speech. And if you say whenever you do it, you are going to have a lawsuit, you're going to be hauled before this commission. You may have a good case, you may not have a good case, but you have to justify yourself to this commission before you can -- before you can make the assertion.   He really lost, didn't he? (Laughter.)
13-298 +++$+++ 
13-299 +++$+++ 
13-301 +++$+++    So you would reverse the district court here if the district court -- you're -- you're not defending what -- what the court of appeals said, that you're entitled to a hearing in every case whenever you -- you say improper motive. Yes, you have -- you don't defend that.   The "we" is who? The "we" is the Tax Court?   Whose words are you repeating?   Okay. So it's the Tax Court that's talking?   Just to be clear on what you're -- what you're asking us to do. You want us to affirm the judgment on -- but on a different basis -- well, on -- you do not concede it's a different basis. But the reason you want us to confirm the judgment -- affirm the judgment below is that, in your view, it would be an abuse of discretion for the district court not to have the -- the hearing.   It would be an abuse of discretion not to do it on the facts of this case.   And what normally happens if you say no?
13-316 +++$+++    You do indeed, but you extend Federal law enormously into the kind of stuff that we've usually left to the States.   Give an explanation rather than a response.   Criminalizes what? I didn't --   And that would be one of them, if you -- if you accept a check, right? If -- if you promise to paint the house, you have no intention of doing it, so it's fraud, and -- and you accept the check. That's it. You're under the statute, right?   But wait. I thought -- I thought you said earlier, and -- and I was going to ask you about that, that he does not have to personally receive bank property.   He just intends that bank property be given to somebody.   Yes.   Absolutely.   But he's -- he's not obtaining the bank's money. You -- you read to obtain -- a scheme or artifice to obtain, you read that for anybody to obtain. I would read it to mean for him to obtain. But that's not how you read it. And you say that's -- everybody reads it the way you do?   Why don't you try the rule of lenity. Why don't you try the rule of lenity?   If -- if we adopt your fallback position, does (2) do anything that (1) doesn't do? I mean, if you made -- if you made your false or fraudulent representations to the bank, surely you intend to defraud the bank.   Excuse me. You have -- you have to posit his expectation that the check will be honored, don't you?   Exactly.   And if it's a scheme that -- that's making alterations that no reasonable person would expect the bank to honor, it seems to me you're out of luck.
13-317 +++$+++    Did we refer to Section 203 --   -- in connection with that dictum?   I think maybe we didn't know about it, as the parties here seemingly did not know about it. I don't think it was cited in the briefs.   Of course. But -- but to act on the assumption that the courts are going to do what they've been doing is quite different from approving what the courts have been doing. As I understand the history of these things, there was one side that wanted to overrule Basic and the other side that wanted to endorse Basic, and they did neither one. They simply enacted a law that assumed that the courts were going to continue Basic. I don't see that that is -- is necessarily a ratification of it. It's just an acknowledgment of reality.   Mr. Boies, you've said that -- that a lot of class certification motions are denied. I had thought that your friend said that that is very rare except in the Second Circuit.   Did I hear that wrong, or --   -- is he wrong?   Mr. Boise, you and I both agree that the PSLRA assumes Basic. Now, we differ on, you know, what that means, but it does assume it. What -- and -- and so those previsions would -- would sort of be useless if Basic were entirely overruled. What if we adopted the professors' -- what, Basic writ small, if -- if we adopted their approach, would those provisions of the PSLRA still be effective?   All right.   If the -- if the SEC brings a fraud action, can it -- can it rely on the -- on the market theory, fraud-on-the-market theory?
13-339 +++$+++    And therefore -- and therefore it should be repealed, not and therefore should be covered by the Federal statute.   Anyway, as the government argued, it doesn't matter. It's not a matter of terminology. It's a matter of reality. It's a matter that these two things, whether they were given different names in 1986 or not, are quite different things. And do you -- do you deny that they are quite different things, and that therefore the statute may apply quite differently?   Well, then you stumble into the difficulty that Petitioner pointed out, or maybe it was the government pointed out. (A)(1) does not refer to two statutes of limitations. It says if the applicable limitations period for such action as specified in the State statute of limitations provides a commencement date which is earlier. Now, you know, if they were really covering two different, or envisioned that in some States you had two statutes of limitations, it seems to me they should have phrased it differently: If the applicable limitations period or periods for such action as specified in the States' statutes of limitations provide -- provides a commencement date or commencement dates, something like that. It's all in the singular.   But, you know, the statute does not refer to your cause of action, so it's hard to say that the period refers to -- it refers to is the period that you are trying to get around. It says if the limitations period for such action, that is, any action brought under -- any action brought under State law. I think to read that as applying to whatever limitations period is asserted by -- against a particular plaintiff, I find it hard to read it that way. It seems to me they're referring to a limitations period for the action that exists under State law, regardless of what is alleged in the particular complaint. Anyway, I -- I think you got a real problem with the singular versus plural phrasing of number (1).   Yeah, except they are both applicable to this cause of action. They -- both of those periods are applicable. You run afoul of one of them, but not of the other one. It doesn't mean they're -- they are not both applicable. Anyway, this is -- this is -- it is angels on the head of a pin, isn't it? (Laughter.)   But the more you talk about horribles that could happen, a State could say, with respect to the special cause of action for creating harm to individuals by hazardous waste, the statute will begin upon discovery and it will last for 3 months. A State could do that, right? And that would comply with this law, wouldn't it? A 3-month statute of limitations. All the Federal law refers to is when the statute commences. But it -- it still is left up to the State to say how long the statute can be, isn't it?   No, no.   You can answer "yes" or "no" to that, I think. The State can make the statute of limitations as short as it wants so long as it commences upon the discovery.   So I can -- I can imagine a lot of horribles that can occur with that, just as you can imagine horribles that occur under the other system.
13-354 +++$+++    It's more than pre-Smith.   Plus --   Okay.   Where  where is that in RFRA? I mean, what -- what factor of RFRA do you fold that in under? Is -- is that part of the compelling State interest requirement or -- or substantial burden requirement? Where -- where is it in RFRA?   If -- if they wanted you to balance -- balance the interest of the religious objector against the interest of other individuals, they -- they made no reference to that in RFRA at all.   They said unless the government has a compelling State interest.   But that wasn't the basis for -- for denying the claim. The basis was that the government has to run a uniform system that applies to everybody.   And you can't argue that here because the government has made a lot of exemptions.   It was an individual making a profit, right?   He was running a business for a profit, and that was the point of -- of Justice Alito's question, right, which I think you understood.   Not a single case in which it was denied exemption, either. All you're saying is --   -- that there are no cases.   Not on the ground that it was a for-profit enterprise. There is not a single case which says that a for-profit enterprise cannot make a -- a freedom of religion claim, is there?   Right.   Whoever controls the corporation. Whoever controls the corporation determines what the party --   So don't make them sign a piece of paper.   You're talking about, what, three or four birth controls, not all of them, just those that are abortifacient. That's not terribly expensive stuff, is it?   Except that they passed RFRA after that. That made a lot of sense. But the question is they passed RFRA after that.   That's okay for not-for-profit corporations to do that with respect to all of their employees, and some of them are pretty big operations --   -- that's okay there?   They can make -- you allow them to make this religious objection, don't you?   But they don't have to pay for it, right?   And you could set that up this way, that these people don't have to pay for it.
13-369 +++$+++    If that's -- if that's what it held we wouldn't have taken this case. I thought we took it because it had some really extravagant language.   I mean, it's one thing to run away from that language, as your brief does. It's another thing to deny that it exists.   Would this patent be valid if the concurrence's approach prevailed? It wouldn't work, would it? It would not work. The mere fact that you spaced it somewhere where the hands can touch it would not necessarily produce the result, would it?   That's all the claim said.   Right.   Whereby. Whereby. I would read that as saying so long as you put the spacing at some point where the hands can touch it and they are not touching, that will produce the result that the signals will be equalized. That's how I would read the claim.   No, no.   No. Yes, I understand that, but that's not what it says. It doesn't say space the electrodes in such a manner that the signals coming from each side will be equal and you'll have to do this by trial and error. That's not what it says. It just says, you know, keep the electrodes apart. They have to be apart so that the hands don't touch, and on the other hand they can't be outside the scope of what the hands grip. That's all it says. Whereby, if you do that, the signals will be equalized. That's -- that's how I would read it. It wouldn't work that way, would it?   Let the record show that the Justice is holding his fingers in the air. (Laughter.)   You know, I can understand that if the claim said that. If the claim said, you know, fiddle with it until it works. But it doesn't say that. It just says, you know, spacing, and I would think so long as there's space, they don't touch, and they're no more than the widths of the hands, it'll work. It doesn't say that. I don't think the "whereby" is -- is an invitation to experiment. But the other case you were talking about, tell us more about it. It just said a high angle.   There's never more than one correct construction. Even -- even when there is there isn't. I mean, we always have to come up with an answer. And the patent office has to come up with an answer. It means this or it doesn't mean this. Have you ever heard of a court that says, well, you know, it could mean either one of these?   It's a tie. (Laughter.)   So then you win all the time.   There is no such thing as ambiguity, because there is always a right answer.   When do we ever decide a case in which we would not say that our result is appreciably better than the result we reject?   Well, it's still close, but not appreciably better. If it's not appreciably better, we would have to say it's a draw.   Well, I think the test you're giving us is not much of a test, it really isn't. It seems to me it says so long as there is a right answer, everything else is wrong.   How big is appreciable?   You don't know.   -- subject to being read, not overread.
13-461 +++$+++    That may well be, but it doesn't contradict the Chief Justice's question. I mean, you're just saying that by doing it this way you don't violate the copyright laws. But his question is, is there any reason you did it other than not to violate the copyright laws?   Mr. Frederick, your -- your client is -- is just using this for local signals --   -- right now. But if we approve that, is there any reason it couldn't be used for distant signals as well?   Possibly what? There is possibly a reason, or it could possibly be used?   What would the difference be. I mean, you could take HBO, right? You could -- you could carry that without -- without performing.
13-483 +++$+++    So your -- your position is you cannot speak as a citizen if -- if your speech consists of disclosing material that you knew as an employee. Why is that true?   Yes, but this is not an official job duty. It's just a matter that I know of because of my job. Why does that mean that when I disclose that, I am not speaking as a citizen?   No, I'm just --   I'm just talking about facts, no opinions, just facts. But I learned those facts on the job as an employee, and I -- is it your position that whenever you are reciting those facts, you cannot be speaking as a citizen?   Where  where -- where did you get this notion that the First Amendment only applies to the expression of views and not to the conveyance of -- of facts?   All of us can be protected from knowing certain facts and that would not violate the First Amendment?   So the government --   -- can presumably prohibit anybody teaching, what, economics, the facts of -- of economics?   The facts of World War II.   I don't know where you get it from. I've never heard of this distinction, the First Amendment protects only opinions and not facts. I've never heard of it.
132, Orig. +++$+++         Before you get to that --        While we are on 7(C), I'm not clear on how you are reading that last section. Is the last phrase -- "relating to the enactment of this compact" -- is it your position that that phrase is joined not only with the immediately preceding words -- "the laws of the party States" relating to the enactment of this compact -- but that it also refers back to compliance with the conditions and requirements of this compact relating to the enactment of this compact?        It certainly isn't grammatically compelled, but does it make any sense?        Conditions and requirements relating to the enactment of the compact?        Well, why didn't you withdraw?    I mean, all this is very good.              You had that absolute right to withdraw, but you didn't withdraw in -- when was it -- '97.                You went on for 2 years, still as a member of the compact and still subject to obligations under the compact.                How could it be said that you were taking all appropriate steps?   What is the language -- all --        Yes.        You took no steps at all. You took zero steps.        Why didn't you withdraw?        They had no benefit from the compact for those 2 years?        Well, you are not arguing impossibility, though.     I mean, the other side --        Did North Carolina continue to fund the authority during this interim period?        So it didn't do nothing during this period?        You have the authority still in existence, right?        Don't they have any employees?        So somebody has to be keeping the authority alive, right?               Who did that?        So -- wait, wait, wait. You said all the Commission funds were for prior expenditures.        Oh.
134 ORIG +++$+++              He is asking about under this thing.   Forget about the Commerce Clause.            And it's obvious what the purpose of the hypothetical is.             You're saying that to give you the right to wharf out does not mean that you can use the wharf for any purpose that's contrary to the police power prescriptions of Delaware. That is reasonable enough. Well, what if one of the police power prescriptions is you can't have a wharf?                Now, you know, can you flatly contradict what Article VII says?               And I really think you ought to give that one away. (Laughter.)              It was a wharf that didn't go beyond a low-water mark?              What did they do, jump onto the land? (Laughter.)             So a wharf that is just ugly is okay.   Your answer to Justice Souter is, Delaware can't say no more wharfs.               If I understand you correctly, Mr. Frederick, you say that the -- that the police power of Delaware, despite Article VII, includes the power to require you to get a license before you can wharf out from the New Jersey Shore?               In other words, Delaware can say no you can't wharf out unless, you get a license from us, despite Article VII.               Of course it goes beyond the boundary.   If it --               If the other side of the boundary you don't need Article VII.                     New Jersey can allow anything to be done up to -- up to the low water mark, but you're saying that despite Article VII Delaware can say no, you cannot wharf out until you get a license from us?                Oh --                You've just read Article -- Article VII out of the Compact.                It gives nothing to New Jersey.               That's fine.        They can do it.               So long as it pays.                Excuse me.       New Jersey does not have full property in the shore of the Delaware?                Well, then that's no basis for distinguishing.       What else is there?               I don't understand that. It's up to Maryland what's a concern.                    If Maryland doesn't want any water taken, why isn't that a valid exercise of Maryland's police power?               You don't even acknowledge that.   You deny even that.          You have said that Delaware can prevent the wharfing out and say you can't wharf out unless you get a license from us.             Wait.       He is not done.    As a matter of police power, however, they can do anything?
137, Orig. +++$+++        But we're dealing here with a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact that article V(A) says appropriative rights to the beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River System existing as of January 1, 1950.     Appropriative rights not to diversion, not to diversion for beneficial uses, but appropriative rights to the beneficial uses, which is defined -- which is defined in the compact to say "that use by which the water supply of a drainage basin is depleted when usefully employed." And it could have said diversion, but it didn't say that, and I notice that the Government's brief uses -- seems to use the words interchangeably, "depletion" and "diversion."     They're not interchangeable.     They're defined quite separately in this thing.     And besides which I find it implausible that Montana signed on to, well, we don't know how much water we're going to get; it depends, you know, upon how much stuff was -- was flowing back before, but we're not guaranteed that that will be flowing back again. You combine those two things, and I -- I - what do you do about that definition?       That's not how it's defined.       Well, that's fine.       Why don't you emphasize both of them?       I'm willing to emphasize both, but you can't write out the "depleted" out of the -- how does your definition of "depleted" differ from - from "diversion"?       Is the diversion for a beneficial use the same thing as a depletion?       No, but, I mean, to -- to do that, the definition would have read:     The term "beneficial use" is defined to be that use by which the water -- that use "for which" the water supply of a drainage basin is diverted for useful employment by the activities of man, and that's not what it says.     To the contrary, it makes a clear distinction between "depletion" and the previous definition of "diversion." I just -- I was trying to give that stark difference some effect in the later section V(A).       Okay.       Where -- where -       What part of V(B) are you talking about?       The point of measurement shall be below the last diversion?       For -- exactly.     I mean, there it talks about diversions for beneficial use and not depletion for beneficial use.     I mean, I think that's something different.       Oh, so when -       It is fair.       The person who doesn't get it, gets it. (Laughter.)       Well, hydropower would - would not constitute a diversion.       Well, but that -- that's a diversion.       It means the taking or removing of water when the water so taken or removed is not returned directly into the channel of the Yellowstone River.     So if you have a mill race, the water comes through the mill race, goes right back; it's -- it's not even a diversion.     You don't have to qualify as a beneficial use.       Why doesn't it use "diversion" if it means what you say?       Of course it's quantified. I mean, the whole purpose is you can't take any more than you were taking before.     It has to be quantified somehow.       A mill race is not -       A mill race is not a diversion.       Not under the definition.
138, Orig. +++$+++           Yes, I think all FERC said is -- is that nothing in its license would -- would require allocation of water by -- by North Carolina. And that's quite different from whether -- whether a severe reduction in the water that Duke can use would -- would affect the -- the nature of the license given by FERC.          And is it automatic then? Is it automatic then?     Or is it just that, when that condition is met, the Special Master can permit the intervention?          And, also, how helpful the intervention will be to the management of the case.          And, of course, the Special Master's determination of that is not final.             It's ultimately up to us.          But it is a discretionary intervention you are arguing for, not a mandatory one.          Do you think the same -- the same test applies to the appropriateness of naming a private party defendant, as you would urge for intervention by a private party defendant?          Well, in -- in deciding what's equitable as between the two States, I guess the -- the Court, ultimately, and the Special Master, initially, will have to decide what uses of water by one State or the other are not equitable uses --          -- and go beyond what is reasonable.    So I don't see how you could decide the case without deciding whether especially particularly massive uses are appropriate or not.           Dead losses to South Carolina.          And I guess it depends on what you mean by the water in dispute.              If the main gravamen of the complaint is interbasin transfers, they -- they occupy a huge proportion of that.           Did -- did the decree only apply to taxing these particular companies?                 Could the -- could the State have taxed other companies after the decree issued?           Is that yes or no?          I -- you say yes, it would have general applicability.
11-398 +++$+++ 
11-400 +++$+++        What do you think we --       -- meant in -- in those -- those dicta in -- in several prior cases, where we've said that the Federal Government cannot be coercive through the Spending Clause?     What -- what do you think we were -- give -- give us a hypothetical.       Okay.       But anything else, so long as you --       -- you have to have -- you're talking about situations where they have to locate their statehouse in some other city --       -- and they have no choice. But short of that, they can make the State do anything at all?       You can't imagine a case in which it is both germane and yet coercive, is what you're saying.     There is no such case as far as you know.       I wouldn't think that that's a surprise question.     I mean, you know --       Hey, I can't think of one. I'm not blaming you for not thinking of one. (Laughter.)       I would have thought there was a serious political strain -- constraint on the individual mandate, too, but that didn't work. What you call serious political constraints sometimes don't work.       Of course not.       The smaller it, is the bigger the coercion.       The smaller what you're demanding of them, the bigger the coercion to go along.      And who wins?       Could never do it or wouldn't?       It's your prediction. Okay.       Are you willing to acknowledge that the Administrative Procedure Act is a limitation on the Secretary's ability to cut off all the funds; she can't do it if it -- if that would be unreasonable?     Are you willing to accept that?     I wouldn't if I were you.       Indeed, part of the discretion is to cut off all of the funds.     That's what the statute says, and I think --.       I wouldn't worry a lot if I were you.     I don't know of any case that, where the Secretary's discretion explicitly includes a certain act, we have held that, nevertheless, that act cannot be performed unless we think it reasonable.     I don't know any case like that.       Yes, when there's just a general grant of discretion, it has to be exercised reasonably.     But maybe Justice Breyer knows such a case.       All right.     Give it to me. (Laughter.)       May it do so? Doesn't the question come down to this -- maybe you can answer this "yes."     But isn't the question simply:     Is it conceivable to you, as it was evidently not to Congress, that any State would turn down this offer, that they can't refuse?     Is it conceivable to you that any State would have said no to this program? Congress didn't think that, because some of its other provisions are based on the assumption that every single State will be in this thing.       Now, do you -- can you conceive of a State saying no?     And -- and if you can't, that sounds like coercion to me.       So, what do you predict? If you predict the same, that 100 percent of the States will accept it, that sounds like coercion.      They'd have to bail out of Medicaid, you're talking about --      -- not just -- yes.
12-1226 +++$+++    I assume that you disagree with the Petitioner -- the Petitioner's proposition that when you take these three classes, namely, off the job -- I'm sorry, on-the-job injuries, ADA injuries, and the -- what was the third one?   Yes, yes, getting disapproved as drivers by DOT. There's almost nothing left. That's -- that's what --
12-1497 +++$+++    And what does the word "offense" --   What does the word "offense" mean in that provision?   In that provision, what -- what does the word --   It's a criminal offense, right?   It wouldn't make any sense in Title 18 unless the offense they're referring to is one -- one of the criminal offenses of Title 18.   Read the provision again, would you?   Where -- where did that appear?   Okay. That's all I needed to know.   What Congress was that?   And that's -- where does that appear?   Two -- two Senate committees or just one Senate committee?   And that's the Congress.   I mean, all that's true except --   -- except when you're dealing with an old statute that used to be clearly criminal, and it seems to me that at that point the burden -- when that statute is expanded -- the burden is on you to show that it's been changed from the criminal to the civil --   -- to include the civil. And, you know, that's a different burden from what you expect.   Well, were they --   Were they district courts? Four district courts? Is that it?   And did Congress know about those?   Ah, ah.   Who urges the word "offense"? That's the limitation that is urged, which is normally used to connote a crime.   And I don't think that changes --   -- if you put the word "any" in front of it.   I'm not sure the government will agree with that, as you confidently predict, but I guess we'll ask the government. But I think --   I think you're saying that if somebody brings a suit and is -- and loses, the government is -- is thereby precluded from joining a later suit. Right? The government is.   Yeah.   Right.   Right.      We'll see what the government thinks of that.   Well, whoa, whoa. You can say that it limited it or you can say that it -- it showed -- it showed that the word "offense" in that statute was being used to mean a criminal offense, right?   It could. I acknowledge that sometimes you can say "offense" and it means civil, sometimes you can say that it means criminal, and sometimes you can say it means both. But what that language did in the original statute was to make it clear that the word "offense" in this statute was being used in a criminal sense. And I don't think that that implication is eliminated by simply taking out the -- taking out the "now indictable" language, which could have been eliminated for a very different reason; and that is, to show that it -- it operates prospectively.   But there would be no other reason for eliminating the word "criminal"; whereas, there is a very good other reason for eliminating the phrase "now indictable."   Mr. Stewart, before your time runs out, what -- what is the Government's position on the -- on the point raised by counsel for Respondent; namely, if there is a dismissal of -- on the merits of a -- a civil action, is the government barred from later bringing a different action on the same claim?
126, Orig. +++$+++    Well, you could say the same about contracts. I mean, no -- nobody is saying that disgorgement is not a remedy for contracts, right?   The problem is what should be the conditions under which disgorgement is imposed. Does it reguire an intentional violation or not? That's -- that's all the debate is about here.   What does the Restatement base that on? Did they just make that up? Are there are a lot of cases that say that?   Just because the Restatement says it, we -- we've got to believe it? How many cases are there that impose disgorgement where there is no intentional violation, but property rights are involved. Do you have a lot of cases?   That's not enough for normal contract disgorgement, is it?   You need intentional violation, don't you?   Exactly. And -- and you say there's an exception where it's property rights involved. And I'm asking you what cases do you have for that? You see, I don't -- I don't -- I don't think the Restatement can change our law by just saying something by consensus of law professors.   Are there cases that -- that have established that rule?   Ms. O'Connell, we've -- we've had a lot of compact -- water compact cases before this Court. I mean, a lot. Can you give us one case in which we have imposed disgorgement even -- even for an intentional violation?   And the second guestion is How many for an unintentional violation?   Minus something, right?   For an intentional violation.   But we've never done it, have we?   So it's dictum, right?   Well, wait. A lot of contracts -- my goodness. Eguity courts adjudicate contract rights sometimes.   So, I mean, the -- the issue is whether normal contract principles apply, whether they are the principles dealing with law or the principles dealing with eguity. And disgorgement is an example.   And normal contract principles say an eguity court will not give disgorgement unless there's an intentional violation. So I don't think your appeal to eguity carries the day at all.   And the -- it went on to say how -- how you will determine whether there is such water supply.   It went on to determine that.   Through a formula.   And they agreed to that formula, right?   Let's assume two parties -- I come into an antigue store and I see this -- this item of furniture that I like, and I talk it over with the -- with the owner, and I say, you know, let -- let's come to a fair price on this. He says, yes, that's what I want to do, too. Let's have a fair price. And we write it down. It's going to be a fair price. And the fair price is $200. Okay? It turns out this thing is worth more than $200. Okay? But both the antigue dealer and I know that this is a game of rolling the dice, that -- that the risks you take when you buy and you sell antigues is that it's worth more. And that's the same risk here. The parties knew that this formula would not be entirely accurate and they agreed to a fair price, that is, none of this water should be counted. But they said the way to figure out whether this water is coming in or not is this formula. Why shouldn't they be held to that formula? That -- that was the deal.   Well, that -- well, that's just like saying the parties can amend this contract, right? I mean, those procedures take the consent of each one of the parties. So that amounts to saying nothing except what is obvious and would be the law even if it were not said, that the parties, by mutual agreement, can amend the contract. Does it mean anything different from that?   Was the appendix included in it when it was submitted to Congress?   That was just added afterwards?   Does disgorgement and injunction -- do the two go together?   If it's inappropriate to issue an injunction, is it always inappropriate to reguire disgorgement? Are they both looking to the future, so that if there is no realistic possibility of future violation, you cannot issue an injunction and you should not reguire disgorgement? Is that a correct statement?   I'm not sure you've answered my guestion. You say it should not be used as a future tool. So it can be used even though it's not being imposed in order to deter future action.   Can you get in a normal contract case both your damages and disgorgement? I always thought you were put to the choice.   You either sue for your damages or you sue for unjust enrichment. Can you do both? You get your damages plus the other guy's profits.   One --
13-1010 +++$+++    Is there a practice on this -- on this subject?   Okay, I'm not talking -- I'm talking --   -- about in the industry.   Yeah, but Sixth Circuit we can't rely on because of Yard-Man.   So -- so in a way, you would expect the union to give this away so -- so it can get higher benefits for the people that are still in its bargaining unit, wouldn't you?   Well, that's a cynical   Right, right.
13-1019 +++$+++    Well, let's go back to the ( language you quoted. The commission is unable to obtain an agreement acceptable to it. To obtain an -- do you acknowledge that it is obliged to try to obtain an agreement acceptable to it --   Yes. Now, is it possible that you are trying to obtain an agreement acceptable to you when you do not tell the other side what that might be?   You just say, you know   You have to make me an offer. That's not -- that's not difficult to find out. Did you make an offer or not.   No, not necessarily. I mean, you could --   -- draw a line somewhere, but -- but if the other side says the EEOC never made me an offer, I had no idea -- no notion of what I had to agree to.   We don't have adopt a good -- we don't have to adopt a good-faith standard. We -- we could simply say that if you are really trying to conciliate, there are a few things that you got to do. And one of them is to make an offer. Is that difficult to figure out?   Ms. Saharsky, I don't even agree with you about the incentives. I think, as the other side points out, there is considerable incentive on the EEOC to fail in conciliation so that it can bring a big-deal lawsuit and get a lot of press and put a lot of pressure on this employer and on other employers. There are real incentives to have conciliation fail.   Do you disagree that they can publish it in the New York Times if they want?   Right.   Right.   Because that isn't credible.   That's not publishing it in the New York Times, is it?   That only cuts your own argument. I mean, you're -- you're worrying about their -- their publishing it, and then you say they have no incentive to publish it. But if they want it published, they can publish it in the New York Times. They don't have to bring a lawsuit to do it.   You say that, but it didn't say that it shouldn't be public. They said it shouldn't be use in court proceedings. That's quite different from saying it shouldn't be public.   So why do you say the opposite?   That's the world. That's the world. There's always litigation over -- over stuff. I mean, you -- you want to be exempt from any litigation over whether a particular standard has been met or not?   That's extraordinary. That does not exist in this world.   That is fine. And if you don't like that, if you're worried -- number one, this Court could set forth standards one, two, three, four, five; you have to do this, this, this, and this. I would prefer not to do that. And if you leave it to the lower courts to do it, each lower court is going to have a different -- a different set of things. But the remedy for that is -- is at your hands. As the other side said, you could issue rules which say, this is an informal process, but what it consists of is, number one, we give you notice of what the -- what the offense is; we sit down with you to discuss settlement of that; number three, we make apparent to you what our offer is for settling the matter, and whatever other rudiments of conciliation the agency believes in. What's wrong with that?   So if we tell you it's it's judicially reviewable -- suppose we just decide it's judicially reviewable and remand for the agency to issue rules?   But I thought Justice Breyer said you have to make the phone call if your letter says it's going to make the phone call. I thought Justice Breyer believed that there are some rudiments.  We're just talking about what the rudiments are
13-1032 +++$+++    Am I correct that Colorado is the only State that seeks to do this with respect to out-of-State sellers?   I cannot imagine that the other States have not piled on with this thing if it is -- if it is so essential to the tax system and if there are no problems with -- with doing it. My goodness.   No. I understand.   But the fact that it's it's a one of a kind gives me some pause. This is certainly a -- a very important case because I have no doubt that if we come out agreeing with you, every one of the States is going to pass laws like this.   And all sellers will also have to be providing this information.   Let's assume I am a not -- not-for-profit -- an unpopular not-for-profit corporation that has members who don't -- who don't want their identity known because hurtful things will be done to them. And I make a sale which would -- would be exempt from Colorado's laws if indeed it was made by a not-for-profit organization to one of its members. And Colorado demands from this organization the names of its members. And you tell me that cannot get into -- I'm claiming a First Amendment objection to turning over the names of my members, and you tell me that cannot get into Federal court.   It can't be that central if no other State has it.   How central can it be?   Let's  let's assume a State law that gives the State taxing authority a lot of money for new computers, and somebody challenges that law on some State ground, whatever it is. Would that challenge -- on some Federal ground. Would that challenge not be able to be brought in Federal court because the computers are going to help the tax service to get more delinguent taxpayers and, therefore, you are restraining the collection of taxes?   Why not?   Can it make the -- the foreign seller collect the tax?   Well, that is sort of strange. It can't make them collect it, but it -- it has the power to compel them, non -- non-State citizens, out-of-State people, provide the information, assist in the State's collection of the tax? I don't know why --   I don't know why the one and not the other.   But you know that we accept minuscule, minuscule percentage of appeals from State supreme courts. And as a practical matter, these challenges in State supreme courts, if they're -- if they're ruled in a manner that -- that violates Federal law, they're not going to come up here -- 90 percent of them aren't going to come up -- more than 90 percent. So it is important that it begin in Federal court when -- especially when what is at issue is the selfish State's assessment and collection of taxes. I mean, there is a real incentive on the part of the State government which includes the State courts to, you know, to find the tax not paid.   Well, for collection, yes.   Restrain means impede?   Isn't restrained a synonym for impede? I -- I thought restrain means to stop. You restrain somebody, you prevent that person from doing what he wants to do. But you're using it to mean, you know, whatever impedes the collection of the tax. It doesn't make it impossible, it doesn't stop it. It just -- it just impedes it.   It's the means of what let's posit a State law that reguires all taxpayers to use only a single bank because it will be -- one bank named by the State because it will be easier to levy upon all -- upon all accounts. It makes it a lot easier for the State. They just go to that bank and take your bank account. Okay? This is challenged as being a taking, okay, and the party tries to get into Federal court with that Federal challenge. Not possible, right? Because this facilitates the collection of the State tax and therefore to prevent that facilitation is to restrain the collection of the State tax and therefore the suit has to be brought in State court; is that right?   Yes, it is. That's the whole reason --
13-1034 +++$+++    It doesn't say more than tenuously related to. It says related to. Where are you smuggling in the "tenuously"?   Do you, please -- do you think that if we apply a modified categorical approach and focus in on the conviction here which was for a sock? Do you think a sock is more than tenuously related to -- to these Federal drugs?   Right. That's why I'm proposing modified categorical approach. He was convicted of having a sock and you think that's more than tenuously related to these Federal drugs.   You said the second, didn't you?   She said it.   You wouldn't want that swept into this statute, would you?
13-1041 +++$+++    Well, even for that period. I assume he'd have to prove that he relied on the regulations.   If he went ahead and did this without any knowledge of the regulation, he would not be in good faith reliance on a regulation, would he?   Again, unless it is adding procedures if you acknowledge that this is an interpretative rule.   So it is absolutely essential to your position and to Paralyzed Veterans that this change has to be regarded as a substantive rule, right?   And if we disagree with that, you acknowledge that Paralyzed Veterans is wrong.   You're -- you're saying that what the question presented boils down to is whether an interpretative rule that radically modifies a prior interpretative rule is a substantive rule. That -- that's what you say the question presented boils down to.
13-1074 +++$+++    It isn't just that phrase. It's other language that is just lifted verbatim from the two prior Acts. And you add to that the fact that the purpose of this statute was to eliminate the exception in the Tucker Act for torts. The --   That was the obvious purpose of it, so they -- they repeat the language of the Tucker Act and say it applies to torts. One would think that the same limitations that applied to the Tucker Act continue to apply.   Well, it seems to me that is incompatible with what I thought your position was, that it depends upon congressional intent. So we can just ignore everything you've argued up to here. It doesn't depend upon congressional intent because we can give those words meaning that the Congress did not give them at the time. You have to pick one argument or the other.   Are you -- are you going to be bound by -- by what the Congress at the time believed it was enacting or not?   Well, that may well be, but --   Look, there are a lot of statutes, perhaps most statutes, that are not explicit. That do not use the magic language that you insist this statute have. And when that happens, we don't just sit back and say, well, in that case, it's up to us. We don't say that. We have certain rules that -- that determine what the presumptive intent of Congress was. And I don't care whether each individual member of Congress or, indeed, any single one of them had that in mind. They ordinarily don't. But we have rules, one of which that is very strong, is that when you adopt the language from another statute -- especially when it is in the same area, and this is the same area as the Tucker Act, it is eliminating the Tucker Act exemption for torts. When you have the same language and it has been -- that language has been interpreted by the courts uniformly over a period of years to mean a certain thing, we will presume that that is what Congress had in mind when it used the language. Now, if you're asking us to abandon that rule and just sit back in -- in any case when the legislative history doesn't say anything and -- and make up what we think should be the best answer, that simply is not the way we've proceeded.   You think man means women, right? Never mind.   You know, I don't find the -- the existence of -- of those exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, so persuasive, because unlike the Tucker Act, the Tort Claims Act refers to State law, so you have to make exceptions unless you're going to suck in everything about State law, procedures and everything else. So, you know, it's sort of apples and oranges. The fact that those exceptions are there are explicable not because Congress didn't think jurisdiction meant jurisdiction in the narrow sense, but, rather, because having referred us to State law, they had to make some exceptions from State law.
13-1075 +++$+++    Mr. Rosenkranz, so I understand you, are you arguing that tolling applies to the presentment provision even though it doesn't apply to other provisions?   Is it possible for us to hold that?   I don't know what you mean by "refreshes congressional intent." We have a fairly rigid doctrine that repeals by implication are not favored. And are you saying that intent was "refreshed" so that even if Congress originally thought this was jurisdictional in the narrow sense, it now no longer is because of the adoption of the presentment provision?   You -- you contradict the Government on that point. I'm sure the Government said just the opposite.   Well, you say they are later cases but they didn't say the law has changed from what it used to be; did they? Didn't they purport to say that the court of claims had always had that power?
13-1080 +++$+++    That's the big problem here, regulatory authority. As far as I'm concerned, that's the big difficulty. Why is this an exercise of regulatory authority when all it does is enable an investigation?   So for -- I mean, for that purpose, what difference does it make whether it's a governmental entity or not, so long as it is operating on a for-profit basis and is giving -- is given the last word on some regulatory matters that disadvantage its competitors, there's a violation of due process. I -- I don't see how it makes any difference whether you call it governmental or not.   You have to posit that the energy department manufactures bulbs.   And that it keeps the profit from the bulbs on its own. It doesn't have to go deposit it in the treasury. So the -- so the -- it is a profit-making entity and it prescribes standards, as Justice Breyer suggested, that harms other people. That would be a parallel to this.   Well, he said the metrics and standards for the first time made it realistic that there would be enforcement of that reguirement.   No. I think -- I think you can allow a private party to bring an enforcement action.   I mean, even if they just said an enforcement action shall be commenced if Amtrak reguests it. I think that would be perfectly constitutional.
13-1174 +++$+++    But these statutes do not speak of consolidation of cases, they speak of consolidated proceedings. Where -- where do you get the notion that the cases have been consolidated? And if that notion were true, surely the consolidation must terminate when one of the cases is dismissed, how can it still be consolidated when it's dismissed and the other, and the other cases are proceeding.   It makes a big difference.   Mr. Waxman, have you made this argument before, did you make this argument in opposition to the petition for certiorari, namely that there was no final judgment here.   But aren't   Yes, but that's quite different. You were defending the proposition, I thought, that the Second Circuit said that there had been no final judgment in this case. Not in the consolidated cases but no final judgment in this case. And I don't read that -- that order on -- on Page 2A as saying anything other than that there's not been a final order under -- under 1291 because all the cases have not been disposed of.   Well, I -- that's a very strange way to read that.   Given the opinion of --
13-1175 +++$+++    Is it  is it your position that there is no instance in which this statute and the -- the implementation of it would be constitutional?   Seeing the light on doesn't prove anything unless you know that the hotel has not registered the person who is in the room.   And --   They -- they -- they could fill in. While he's running off getting his subpoena, they fill in who was in that room.   I don't understand.   He has it in his pocket?   All you're asking for all this litigation is just that the one who wants to inspect it, just pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to him and that makes it all okay.   He could say the same thing without the subpoena.   They're not entirely private records --   -- they're records required by law to be kept and you are not objecting to that at all.   Would you -- would you you've constantly said that one of the objections that the hotel owner can make is that you want these records for enforcement of the criminal law, right? You say that's bad.   But the whole purpose of this thing is to enable the criminal law to be enforced, isn't it?   Well, I think there may be an exception to that principle where the whole purpose of the scheme is to enable the detection the criminal activity.   And then the objection would be the whole scheme is bad. You cannot require them to keep books because its whole purpose is to detect criminal activity. But that's not what you're arguing. You're saying, they can keep the books in order to detect criminal activity, but if they request the book in order to detect criminal activity, it's bad.   That doesn't make any sense at all.   Well, what is -- what is the argument?   I have a problem imagining tranquil hotel owners. It's not what I associate with owning a hotel.   How many of these Courts' precedents involves a business that has been treated like a public utility? I mean, there are requirements for hotels, how big the room has to be, how many people you can put in the room, even in -- in many locations, how much you can charge for the room. The hotel owner is not like the -- like a private business. He is a regulated provider of -- of public services that has traditionally been regulated closely over the years.   My goodness.   Once again, you're not complaining about the privacy interests of the guests. That's not your complaint here.   Well, that means it's true. (Laughter.)
13-1211 +++$+++    So it can be taken away from the jury you're saying? If -- if no jury could possibly find tacking appropriate, the Court could issue a judgment as a matter of law.   Of course you -- you need some predictability for a judge for disallow a jury verdict as a matter of law, right.   I mean, you've got to admit there is some predictability.   Would you repeat what you said about the -- the other defenses, laches and what else?   And those are still available on -- on remand?
13-1314 +++$+++    No, no, no, not -- not if the same thing violates the Constitution. I mean, just because Congress agrees with a State that they can do it, does that make it constitutional?   The objection here is a constitutional objection.   Can the second clause be used to revise the first clause? That's what we're talking about here. The second clause can certainly -- Congress can do something on its own, but can Congress use the second clause to revise what the first clause says?   Whatever the State calls a legislature suffices under the -- under the Federal Constitution; is that right?   I mean, suppose the State says the courts are -- are the legislature. Will that suffice under the Federal Constitution?   Give me -- give me one provision of the Constitution that uses the term "legislature" that clearly was not meant to apply to the body that -- of representatives of the people that -- that makes the laws.   All I want is one provision of the Constitution that -- that clearly has your meaning. And I looked through -- through them all. I can't find a single one.   Oh, it's this one. This is the only one.   The consensus definition, although you cannot give us a single instance in the Constitution in which it is clearly used, in which the consensus definition was clearly used? I don't think it was a consensus definition at all. You've plucked that out of -- out of a couple of dictionaries.   It was referring to --   Okay. Let's say -- let's say that "legislature" means the body we normally can think of as the legislature; however, at the time, there was no such thing as the referendum or the initiative. So when the dictionaries referred to "the power" -- "the power that makes laws," it was always the legislature. It was never the people at large, because there was no such thing as -- as the referendum. Now that there is such a thing as a referendum, what about saying, "Okay; 'legislature' means what everybody knows a legislature is, plus the full citizenry, which is a level higher of democracy"? But what we have here is not a level higher of democracy. It's -- it's giving this power to an unelected body of five people that, you know, that -- could -- could that body -- as it's -- as it's constituted here, two of them are elected, or selected, by the majority party, two selected by the minority party. What if -- what if Arizona decided all four would be selected by the majority party?   Would that be okay?   "Legislative process" there means the process in the legislature.   What it takes for the legislature to enact a law.   Once  once you assume "legislative" refers to legislature, your whole argument for Smiley just disappears.

13-1371 +++$+++    It isn't the "unavailable" word that's the problem. The problem is unavailable on the basis of race. You can say "unavailable" a million times, but the statute reguires that it be made unavailable for racial reasons. And you're saying, no, it doesn't have to be; it could be unavailable simply because you use some other nonracial reason, which is stupid, right? That's, that's your argument. If it produces a result that is -- is not -- what, I don't know -- that the races have to be in the same proportion as they are in the general population. Right? I mean, that's what you're arguing.   No, no, no, no. Racial disparity is not racial discrimination. The fact that the NFL is -- is largely black players is not discrimination. Discrimination reguires intentionally excluding people of a certain race.   So let's not -- let's not eguate racial disparity with discrimination. The two are guite different, and what you're arguing here is that racial disparity is enough to make -- to make whatever the policy adopted unlawful, right?   I think your case would be stronger if there had been no court of appeals that had -- that had favored disparate impact. Then -- then you couldn't possibly argue, well, that was put in just to eliminate the erroneous judgments of these courts of appeals in -- in certain areas, anyway. It would be better if no court of appeals had said that --   -- and Congress had enacted these --   That was very persuasive.   What -- what rule you select depends on what affect that will have on racial -- racial use of the facility.   You select on the basis of what affect it will have on race.
13-1402 +++$+++    What would the basis be, the Administrative Procedure Act? It -- it has a provision exempting from review action committed to agency discretion by law. And I think what the government is arguing is that this -- you know, this law commits this stuff to the discretion of the consular officials and the State Department.   What about someone who wanted to marry the immigrant? Not yet married, but say you're depriving me of marital bliss. I want to marry this person, and I can't do it. Would that be enough?   It would be unconstitutional, then, for Congress to eliminate the provisions of the current immigrations law which says that if -- if the wife or the husband is in this country, the spouse can come in. It would be unconstitutional for Congress to say we -- we have immigration quotas for certain countries for certain things, and whether you have a husband or wife in this country has nothing to do with whether you get in. That would be unconstitutional.   It's facially -- it -- it -- you -- you would have to say it's unconstitutional, wouldn't you? If your argument in this case is correct, that would be unconstitutional.   The husband may choose   -- not to appeal. The husband may choose not to appeal. He has a death wish, or whatever, and he doesn't want to appeal. Why would the wife not be able to appeal?   Is that right?   A conviction eliminates your -- your marriage? Is that -- you don't have to get a divorce, you just have to get convicted? That's a good deal. (Laughter.)   Maybe there are more incentivized spouses than there are incentivized law professors. Don't you think that's possible?
13-1487 +++$+++    Why -- well, why do you say that constructive possession only consists of being able to decide where they go? Why isn't it constructive possession to be able to decide who gets them for later transfer? Why doesn't -- why isn't that an exercise --   -- of  of dominion over them to some extent?   I want so-and-so to sell them. I -- I don't know why that isn't exercising dominion and control. It seems to me you're drawing a very artificial line. You only -- you -- you can only exercise dominion and control when you determine where they end up, but I -- I don't see that that comes within -- within the term "constructive possession."   I'm not saying it doesn't make sense. I mean, it may make a lot of sense and may be a very good policy had it been written into this statute. But you're building this whole -- this -- this whole palace upon the word "constructive possession." And I don't see how constructive possession makes -- makes that distinction. It really doesn't.   I don't think it's harder at all. He's deciding where they go for sale. Why isn't that exercising dominion and control?   Why isn't that exercising dominion and control? I mean, he says, I'm not going to propose anything. I'm going to let the Federal government have them. Why isn't that exercising dominion --   Yeah, but he doesn't -- he doesn't have to get anybody to approve the buyer. I think what Justice Kagan is saying, it's -- it's a lot harder to say you have dominion and control when you have to come before an eguity court and say, Please, may I, you know -- please may I have -- have the gun given to my best friend or to somebody else. That doesn't sound much like dominion and control to me.   Is this --   Well, that wouldn't --   Can -- can he pick the firearms dealer?   But the mere fact that his wife has them is not enough --   -- for constructive possession.   But you say that in this context, the mere fact that a friend of his would have them is enough for constructive possession.   Why is that?
13-1499 +++$+++    Unless it's a thank you note.   I mean, once you say you can send a thank you note, what -- what you've just said is not true.   Don't be too intimidated.   Really? A judge -- a judge can't campaign, you know, I'm going to be tough on crime?   Why? That's good responsiveness, I thought.   Ah, okay.   If you -- if you write a thank- you note, you are not a mendicant. You are not going around holding your hat out asking people for money. But you're not relying on that, are you? You're not relying on the judicial dignity --   -- the dignity of the office that is held or sought? That -- that's -- that has nothing to do with Florida's rule.   Where did we say that? I don't -- I don't know the case that says that --   That it's only bad if the restriction is so great that you cannot broadcast your message reasonably?   What law? That's -- that's the only test, you -- you can have all sorts of campaign restrictions so long as they do not prevent and we're going to sit in judgment about whether they prevent the candidate from --   What -- what case are you referring to?   All the First Amendment requires is not that you have unlimited capacity to speak, but that you -- you be able to speak a reasonable amount. Is that -- that what the First Amendment demands?   As much as we think is reasonable -- we, the judges.   Broadly stated as you stated it, I think.   That could be either because lawyers expect judges to respond by favoring their cases or it could be that lawyers care more --   -- about who the judges in the courts are; isn't that quite natural?   I ' d be surprised if the statistics were any different, but it doesn't show any corruption whatever. It just shows that lawyers want good judges and care more about it than the average citizen does.
13-212 +++$+++    Why do you say they are an exception to the Fourth Amendment? They just don't violate the Fourth Amendment. I mean, the Fourth Amendment covers certain things and it doesn't cover other things. The things that it doesn't cover are not -- not -- not exceptions. They're just things not covered.   Well, but that -- that presumption is -- is simply not -- you don't believe that presumption, do you?   There are many more searches conducted without a warrant than with a warrant I -- I bet. I mean, any automobile search, any inventory search, any -- any search of -- of businesses. All sorts of searches are conducted without a warrant. But you still believe that a warrant is the rule and everything else is the exception. I think it may be the opposite, actually.   Well, you can say the same thing about a cigarette pack that -- that has cocaine in it.   Or -- or a gun.   Right.   And why not the phone. That's exactly the question.   Do you have a reasonable -- our rule has been if you carry it on your person, you ought to know it is subject to seizure and examination, and that's been the rule.   And you can open the cell phone and see whatever's in it. So if you carry around a cell phone that isn't encrypted or whatever, you know, you -- you -- you get what you -- what you should have expected. That's -- that's been the rule. If you are arrested, we -- we can seize it and examine it.   I understand. But you so you're arguing for a new rule. The rule right up to ! now has been you can -- we can seize it. We can examine it totally. If it's a book, we can read every page of the book. You want a new rule for cell phones, right?   At all? At all?   You've observed different people from the people that I've observed. (Laughter.)
13-271 +++$+++    No, I'm not sure. It may be an exaggeration to say it -- it falls squarely within the exception given to the states. This is not a state regulation of prices. It's -- it's state regulation of a practice that affects state prices, retail prices, but also affects wholesale prices. It's a little different.   They have power over the transactions that you are complaining about, the transactions that are the subject of the suit.   But -- but wait --   The gravamen of your complaint is the fiddling with the reporting.   That is the antitrust violation, that conspiracy to report false amounts and to make false sales. There is no doubt that the Natural Gas Act places that within the control of the commission. They -- it does have the power to regulate those transactions and to punish violations of those transactions.   Oh, I'm sorry. The reporting. The -- the essence of the conspiracy that you are complaining about in the antitrust case, the actions that you are complaining about in the antitrust case, are actions that come within the jurisdiction of the commission.   Right.
13-352 +++$+++    But, but, but, but. The board has to decide whether the trademark as applied to particular goods is confusing. Once you say it's as applied to particular goods in a particular area of commerce, isn't that the same as saying has used whether it causes confusion?   But even in use what causes the confusion will be the resemblance. I don't care if you just add on -- tack on "as used." The problem is the resemblance between the two marks in every -- in every situation it seems to me.   And this evidence could not have been introduced before the board.   To be sure it was not introduced, but could it have been introduced before the board?   Well, would you give me an example of -- of a situation in which the use is confusing but the resemblance is not?   To be put on shoes?   Well, I'm asking for an example where there is a confusing use, but not a confusing resemblance.   Before the board, you are talking about.   Okay, never mind the board. Doesn't the court that is deciding whether this is an infringing use, doesn't that court have to decide whether that use is confusing by reason of the resemblance?
13-433 +++$+++    Cutting grapefruit for the judge would be a separate principal activity.   I think you hire them to wear proper attire. Of course, you do. You could hire a policeman to wear police uniforms --   No, that's not part of their job as a warehouseman. That isn't what they are hired for. Policemen are hired to look like policemen and act like policemen. And people who argue for the Solicitor General are hired to speak like lawyers and dress like members of the SG's office. I think that's the difference between a principal activity and something that's postliminary or preliminary.   Just as the employer does not hire somebody to check in, that's not the job. I want to employ you to check in? Of course not. So also, an employer does not hire somebody in order to be inspected when he leaves. I don't see how you can call it a principal activity.   And it's not indispensable to the taking care of the material in the warehouse. It's indispensable to -- it's important to the employer and he requires it just as he requires punching in and punching out. But that doesn't make it part of the job.   Well, that's true, but so is punching in and punching out.   What if the employer says I have to take a particular employer-owned trolley to get to the place where I work?   Suppose the employer has enough stations that it just takes a minute to go through. Would you still be making the argument that that's compensable?   Gotcha. Okay. Five minutes?   Is waiting to put on protective gear compensable?   Say it -- say it again?   No.   Unless it's covered by the Portal-to-Portal Act. And the Portal-to- Portal Act is an exception to that.   The notion that if it is compensable work it's covered, there is an exception to -- there's an exception to what the employer requires. He can require some things and yet not be liable for, under -- under the Act, to pay for those things. That's what the Portal-to-Portal Act is about.
13-435 +++$+++ 
13-502 +++$+++    Well, viewpoint discrimination is quite different from content discrimination. And you are trying to reduce our rules against discriminating on the basis of content to a rule against viewpoint discrimination.   I mean, ideological signs, that is a content category, and there is as much a First Amendment right to give somebody directions as there is to speak about -- about being green or whatever else. Is there no First Amendment right to give somebody directions?   They sure do, but is there a First Amendment right for these other messages or not?   And political signs are there almost all year, on the rights-of-way. You talk about clutter. What if somebody doesn't like politics, and he says politics is spinach. I want ideology. I would like ideological signs on the right-of-way. You say, I'm sorry, you are wrong, we think politics is more important, because we are politicians and we're on the city council. (Laughter.)   So your defense to a First Amendment complaint is, what, the State made me do it?   It makes a lot of sense if you believe in the First Amendment.   If you believe that neither the State nor the city is entitled to say politics is really important, as opposed to music.   Whatever that is. Whatever that is, right?   Well, maybe you think that, but the guy who doesn't like politics and likes ideology doesn't think that.   So we're -- we're supposed to sit here and say, oh, political speech is the most valuable and you can allow that, but ideological speech comes in a close second, and then what? Then directional speech or whatever else?   I don't want to do that. I don't think you should want any governmental official, even -- even a judge, to do stuff like that.   What is content-based in a constitutional sense, as opposed to content-based in a non-constitutional sense?   That is viewpoint-based, not content-based.   You want to eliminate content-based as the criterion and make it viewpoint-based.   Is there -- is there a difference between the function of the sign and the content of the sign?   I frankly can't grasp that. What is it?   Doesn't its function depend upon its content?   Poetic?   Poetic?
13-517 +++$+++    Why -- why is that the -- I mean, would we make an exception to normal hearsay rules where racial bias is the issue?   I don't think so.
13-534 +++$+++    What do you do about a State supreme court that sets the ethics rules for the legal profession, including what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law? And let's assume the State has a reguirement that all members of the State supreme court have to be lawyers. What do you do about that?   I'm not talking about the Virginia Bar. I'm talking about the Supreme Court of Virginia.   Are you going to say the Supreme Court of Virginia has to be actively supervised?   They are all lawyers.   Really, really? You are going to have a review board composed of non-neurologists deciding de novo whether a particular person should be admitted or a particular rule should be adopted?   I don't want that. I want a neurologist to decide it.   What about ex-dentists? They're -- they're no longer practicing. But they're all dentists and they have a lot of dentist friends. They're sympathetic to the profession of dentistry. Are you going to give them a pass?   Okay. Okay. Do you really think that the financial interest of the individual members of the board is going to be significantly affected? Of each individual member of the board? My goodness. I -- I find that hard to believe.   Well, I mean, the guestion that follows is: What if all of the members of the board have to refrain from the practice of dentistry during the year that they serve? And you're saying you don't know what the answer will be to that? What the FTC will say to that? I know what the FTC will say to that.   You have very long sentences, so it's very hard not to interrupt you. I -- I don't agree with your first point. I don't see that there's an immense difference between establishing the -- the standards for a profession and excluding an individual from the profession. My goodness. What -- what is a more obvious restriction of competition than preventing somebody from competing? I -- I don't see how you draw that line. Well, it's one thing to say that so-and-so can't practice, but it's another thing to -- to say that tooth whitening is -- is part of the practice. It seems to me they both involve anticompetitive decisions.   That's because what they're promising to do is to serve as faithful private counsel. If they were being sworn in to an agency and promise to execute their duties in accordance with law, it would be guite different. And that's what's happening here.

13-604 +++$+++    Counsel, maybe you have the answer to all the questions I was asking of -- of Mr. Fisher. And -- and I guess the answer is you haven't argued that point, right?   You did not -- you did not assert in your -- in your brief or you haven't asserted it in oral argument, thus far, anyway, that even if it did constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy did not have to be exclusion of the evidence, and that remedy is indeed subject to reasonable mistake of law, and therefore, the decision has to be affirmed. But you didn't make that argument. You want to put all your eggs in the basket of whether it's a violation of Fourth Amendment. Am I right about this?   Okay. I'm sorry to waste so much of our time.   Excuse me. I mean, that just doesn't wash. Yes, in other cases we just decide the -- the right and -- and don't have to decide the remedy, but this is a case in which, unless -- unless the remedy is exclusion, there's no basis for us to set aside the judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Unless -- unless the remedy is exclusion. It seems to me that's part of the case to reverse. If -- if we can't say that, we have no business reversing. But if it hasn't been argued, I guess we can do that. I guess.   How -- how does the statute read here? What are the exact words from the statute.   That -- that seems to be what it says.   Well, I mean, that applies to all rear lamps, the stop lamp and all the other lamps.   So -- so it has to be plural. If it's going to apply to the stop lamp and all the other lamps, of course, it would say lamps.   But that includes the stop light and any other lights. Okay. A stop light, the turn lights, the back-up lights. So you had to use the plural for those other provisions.
13-628 +++$+++    If it -- if it is within Congress's -- if it is within Congress's power, what difference does it make whether it antagonizes foreign countries?   And this may be one of them. So --   -- the mere fact that it upsets foreign relations doesn't prove a thing.   Not necessarily.   General Verrilli, if we agree with the Petitioner, we do not have to confront the constitutional question whether the President has exclusive power over recognition. If we agree with you, we are going to have to grapple with that constitutional question, right? So maybe you want to talk about it.   But if it does, then their argument is going to be it does amount to a -- if it does contradict it, then Congress is making its own judgment about recognition. You have to confront that. Are they entitled to do that? I don't see how you can avoid that question.   War making is an executive function, too.   Well, you see, I -- I pick up this passport, and it says place of birth, Israel. Do I know whether this person was born in Jerusalem or in -- in Haifa?   So how does it -- how does it advertise to the world that -- that the President is contradicting himself? All you know is that the person was born in Israel. It could have been anywhere in Israel.   But it is not a communication contained in the passport itself, is it? You're just saying that -- that this -- this piece of legislation advertises to the world what the situation will be, but -- but you're not compelling the President to -- to say that this individual was born in Jerusalem and we're going to say he was born in Israel, because you can't tell that from the passport.   I know that some of them do. I know that some of them do.
13-6827 +++$+++    I don't understand what you just said.   Right, right.   Why do you need record testimony on -- on a guestion such as that? If -- if you're claiming if he escapes, he can shave off his 1/2-inch beard and thereby alter his appearance, and the -- the response is, well, just take a photograph of him before he grows his 1/2-inch beard, why do you need that evidence on that point? It seems to me it's -- it's obvious. What prevents you from taking a photograph before he grows the 1/2-inch beard, which can then be distributed to police departments if he escapes?   This is not an evidentiary matter at all.   Mr. Curran, I'm not sure what your position is. I -- I thought earlier that you had pretty much abandoned the concealment justification for the policy. Do you -- do you still -- and were relying upon the identification justification.   You think something can be concealed within a 1/2-inch beard.
13-684 +++$+++    For rescission, you mean?   Am I correct the government says rescission has taken place if the borrower is right and it has not taken place if the borrower is wrong?   No, no, no, no. Not if the lender disputes. If in fact the notice has been given, the rescission is ineffective. I think that's the government's position.   As I understand your case, you're -- you're drawing a distinction between exercising the right to rescind and obtaining rescission. Is -- doesn't your case hinge on that?   That -- that the notice is simply an exercise of your right to rescind, but rescission does not occur until there's the exchange that the common law?   What about the Board? You mentioned the Board. Are you going to say anything about Chevron?
13-7120 +++$+++ 
13-719 +++$+++    Do you think it's -- it's constitutional for Congress to say that certain minor issues or what it regards as minor issues shall not be appealable for any reason whatever? So even if it's decided you're going to do it for a plainly improper reason, like religion or race or something, still and all it ain't -- it ain't worth our trouble, right? Could Congress do that?   You don't think Congress did that here.   I think you're going to lose then.
13-7211 +++$+++    Mr. Oldham, some of my questions to -- to your opposing counsel suggest that ineffective assistance of counsel is mistake by mistake. That there are here three claims of ineffective assistance, not just one. Maybe that's so. What do you do with this case where the -- the trial court finds two instances of ineffective assistance, the State agrees that those two are valid. But appeals on the ground that it was harmless error, that the cumulative effect of those two mistakes was not enough to change the outcome of the trial. The defendant, on the other hand, wants to raise the issue that there was, indeed, a third instance of ineffective assistance, and then if you combined all three, there would have been sufficient harm to enable setting aside the verdict. What do you do with that case? There -- there the three separate instances have sort of been combined into one where -- where the issue is the harmful effect.   Okay. So you would allow that one to be -- to be raised without a cross-appeal.   So long as it -- it would -- or at least so long as it's argued that that would produce the incremental effect of reversing the judgment.   The first two were thrown out on the grounds that there was no error; right?   Not on the ground that the effect was not harmful enough to warrant setting aside the judgment.   No. It's superfluous in the sense that it is unnecessary to the judgment. He got the judgment, he won it. The trial was set aside. The conviction was set aside, he got a new trial. And he's saying, oh, there are additional reasons why I should have gotten a new trial. I'm not going to listen to that. That's absurd. You got what you wanted. Now go away. (Laughter.)
13-7451 +++$+++    Is there any other provision of Federal law that has a lesser penalty than 20 years that could have been applied to this -- this captain throwing a fish overboard?   And that's it?   There is nothing lesser than that?   You know, frankly, you come here, and, yeah, he only got -- what did he get, 30 days or something?   But he could have gotten 20 years. What kind of a sensible prosecution is that?   Is there nothing else you -- who -- who do you have out there that -- that exercises prosecutorial discretion? Is this the same guy that -- that brought the prosecution in Bond last term?   No, I'm not talking about Congress. I'm talking about the prosecutor. What kind of a mad prosecutor would try to send this guy up for 20 years or risk sending him up for 20 years?   Well, if that's going to be the Justice Department's position, then we're going to have to be much more careful about how extensive statutes are. I mean, if you're saying we're always going to prosecute the most severe, I'm going to be very careful about how severe I make statutes.   Or -- or how much coverage I give to severe statutes.   Well, that makes it okay. That's fine. I mean, you know, that explains how it happens. It doesn't explain how it makes any sense. (Laughter.)   Well, not only that, 1519 -- 1512 only applies for use in an official proceeding; isn't -- isn't that right?   Yes. And this applies to any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States. Is the knowingly reguirement of 1519, does that apply to that portion of the statute or does it only apply to altering, destroying, mutilating, concealing, covering up, or falsifying? Do you have to know that it is within the jurisdiction of a -- of a Federal agency?   Wow. Then it's really   In this case, it's not a problem.   Is there such a thing as an intangible object? I'm trying to imagine one.   Object not meaning purpose.   I don't think you would get a polite answer to either of those guestions. (Laughter).
13-854 +++$+++    To take what first?   I guess a deed is a private document that's -- has public effect, right? It prevents certain people from trespassing on the property that is conveyed, and I suppose that could be construed in the various courts that reach different results. So the mere fact that -- that this binds the public is -- is not conclusive.   So what do you want the district court to do? Do you want the district court, nonetheless, even though what it finds is not going to be given any deference, do you want them to listen to witnesses?   Or to take at least written testimony where there's what you say is a rare scientific question comes up?   Even if it's going to be decided by the court of appeals, why should the -- why should the district court have any witnesses at all?   So this district judge should not have even taken this testimony; is that it?   Why? Why?   If you're right, we'll say the same thing. I mean, you could call that deference if you like, but --
13-894 +++$+++    And he was successful.   They called off the cancellations.   I'm a little concerned about your acceptance of the hypothetical that the whistleblower doesn't blow the whistle to anybody except the Soviet Union. Do you really think that that's what the statute means when it says to take or fail to take or threaten to take personnel action with respect to any employee because of any disclosure of information which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mis -- don't you think it's implicit in that he's disclosing it to somebody who could remedy the problem as opposed to an enemy?   Mr. Katyal, are there criminal penalties for violation of -- of this statute?   Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's what they all had in mind. I had no doubt of that. (Laughter.)   Does -- does Congress vote on the conference report?   The whole -- the whole House? Each separate House?   Did the Senate vote on that, Mr. Katyal? Did the Senate vote on the Senate committee report?   And did the Senate committee vote on the Senate committee report?   No, they don't.   I thought you were relying on text. I thought you were relying on the difference between law and law, rule, or regulation.   It's not just purpose.   Thank you. I was worried for a minute.
13-895 +++$+++    I thought it was a lot of trouble to redo a plan. Is it not a lot of trouble?   If that turns out to be wrong, I guess you're still not guilty of using race. You're still trying to comply with Section 5 as opposed to being racist; right?   Don't you have to use race to comply with Section 5?   Is there any way to comply with Section 5 without using race?
13-9026 +++$+++    You know, I thought that was the case, which is why I didn't understand Justice Breyer's guestion where he said the amiable bank robber says, would you please step --   Yeah, I'm going to walk into a bank robbery where they have about --   Of course that was unconstitutional, right? The -- imposing the death penalty for this.   For even -- even kidnapping, you know, taking the person away when you're fleeing. It was unconstitutional to apply the death penalty, so we really don't -- don't have to take that into account, I suppose.   Well, if we were going to apply it I guess what we would apply is was there significant fear or trauma induced? I mean, that's -- that's what the statute's about. Threatening people, causing them such excitement that they may have a heart attack, as happened here. I don't know that the distance is what is de minimis. It's how much you put the person in fear, I suppose.   It's a very bad statute.
13-935 +++$+++    Besides -- besides Stern, he means.   But -- but you say that's always going to be the case, that you need an Article III proceeding whenever the bankruptcy trustee determines that something belongs to the debtor and is in the bankruptcy estate and some other private party says, no, it belongs to me. That always has to be litigated in an Article III court?   Is that what you're arguing here?   And I suppose the constitutional provision authorizing Congress to establish a uniform law of bankruptcy does not authorize Congress to establish bankruptcy courts that can decide questions which would normally be decided by Article III courts.   There's very little difference --   That's just contract law, isn't it? I mean, they're just enforcing the parties' contracts.   But --
13-975 +++$+++    Excuse me. Was -- was able to be timely, which means if all of that comes in 5 days before the deadline, it is still able to be timely? I thought they were given 30 days to decide whether -- whether to go forward or not and you're saying it's enough if before the 30 days has totally expired, they -- they can figure out what the city council decided.   I don't understand -- I don't understand what you're saying, it reguires a written decision. Okay. And the city council here issued a written decision to the phone company saying, we have decided to deny your reguest. Now -- and you're saying that is not a written decision, you have to wait until the minutes are written up. So, what, were they lying when they said, we've decided?   And it's ineffective unless that exists. So that what was given here in writing was not a decision, but what? A we intend to decide when the minutes are finally written? A prediction? What was it then --   -- that the phone company got?   It hasn't been denied yet. You're saying it's not denied until the minutes are written --   -- which is, you know, God knows when.   Well, you shouldn't send anything out then because according to you, there has been no decision. You shouldn't send out a notice that we've decided.   That's what you ought to do.   Well, they said that before the vote. We don't know why they voted. What -- what's the big deal of having a city council say, we deny this reguest for the following reasons: One, two, three? That would be very clear; there'd be no problem at all.   Counsel, you -- you spoke of the -- the statutory reguirement of a denial letter. Where -- where is that?   Right.   That's not the denial letter. That's what you're referring to as the minutes. You say it's the minutes that comply with that.   Yes, and constitute it.   There's no reguirement of a notification letter, whatever. There's just that provision that any decision shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence. So why are you imposing this obligation of a denial letter on these poor, ignorant council members? (Laughter.)   I'm taking it as it's written. You're making up a denial letter. There's -- there's no reguirement of a denial letter. So if, indeed, the decision is the minutes, you -- you don't have to do anything until the minutes are published.   I suppose you have to give a copy of the minutes to -- to -- to the loser.   Everybody else like you thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right? Is -- is that a unigue perception that -- that you have come to, or is it generally thought that you have to have a denial letter?
13-983 +++$+++    And the minimum penalty is what? A fine, right?   Counsel, lest we define deviancy down, I don't -- I don't agree with the proposition that in -- in -- well, intramarital disputes people make physical threats to the person of the other. I think that's rather unusual.   Even -- even in the heat of -- of anger.   And the third point is that if the first two are correct, this language is not worth a whole lot any way, right?
13-9972 +++$+++    What's the heartland of routine traffic stops? You have a minute criteria? What is it, half an hour?   What is it? What is it? I want to know what it is so I can complain when it's longer. (Laughter.)   How many minutes when there are three people in the car?   I mean, you've got to pick a minute. Don't you have to pick a minute sooner or later to decide these cases? !   And pick a minute.   What more do you need? There are three people in the car and he's stopped for a broken taillight.   Suppose you have a police department that -- it's in a small state, they have -- every -- every police cruiser has a -- has a canine, and they make it just -- just as common to, you know, to check on the -- the license plate, call in to see if a person has any -- any prior convictions. So, also, they always take the dog around the car.   It's a routine part of of a traffic stop.   Including the time for the dog sniff.   Ah.   Why not? Why not?   That -- that's what a routine traffic stop is for that jurisdiction.   Because that takes only two minutes and that's not unreasonable, right?   Big deal. The dog walks around the car for two minutes. That's --   It can prolong it a little bit.   I didn't understand --
14-103 +++$+++    What about other statutes? I was thinking the same thing, there are other statutes that provide -- that undo the American rule, and they say you're entitled, if you're victorious, to reasonable attorney's fees. Do they usually include fees for getting the fees?
14-114 +++$+++    Of course it could be. I mean it may not be the statute they intended. The guestion is whether it's the statute that they wrote. I mean, you know, there -- there -- there are no provisions in the statute that turn out to be ill -- ill-considered and ill -- ill-conceived.   There are no statutes that make no sense.   If that is the case, every statute must make sense and we will -- we will twist the words as necessary to make it make -- that can't be the rule.   Of course not.   Where is that possible.   I mean, you acknowledge that all of what you're saying only applies where there are alternative readings that are reasonable. You pick the one that will do all the things that you say.   But, but -- if -- if it can only reasonably mean one thing, it will continue to mean that one thing even if it has untoward conseguences for the rest of the statute. No?   Answer me in principle. I mean, is it not the case that if the only reasonable interpretation of a particular provision produces disastrous conseguences in the rest of the statute, it nonetheless means what it says. Is that true or not?   Well, I disagree with that. You have a single case in which we have said the provision is not ambiguous, it means this thing, but, Lord, that would make a terrible statute, so we will interpret it to mean something else. Do you have one case where we've ever said that?   What about -- what about Congress? You really think Congress is just going to sit there while -- while all of these disastrous conseguences ensue. I mean, how often have we come out with a decision such as the -- you know, the bankruptcy court decision? Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that -- that takes care of the problem. It happens all the time. Why is that not going to happen here?   I -- I don't care what Congress you're talking about. If the conseguences are as disastrous as you say, so many million people without -- without insurance and whatnot, yes, I think this Congress would act.   This is not the most elegantly drafted statute. It was -- it was pushed through on expedited procedures and didn't have the kind of consideration by a conference committee, for example, that -- that statutes usually do. What -- what would be so surprising if -- if, among its other imperfections, there is the imperfection that what the States have to do is not -- is not obvious enough? It doesn't strike me as inconceivable.   There were senators, were there not, who were opposed to having the Federal government run the whole thing, because they thought that would lead to a single-payer system, which -- which some people wanted. And the explanation for this provision is it prevents -- it prevents the -- the Federalization of -- of the entire thing.   That's -- that's certainly a plausible explanation --   -- as to why the provision is there.   Well, you're -- you're putting a lot of weight on the -- on the -- one word, such, such Exchange. Such -- it seems to me the most unrealistic interpretation of "such" to mean the Federal government shall establish a State Exchange. Rather, it seems to me "such" means an Exchange for the State rather than an Exchange of the State. How can the government -- Federal government establish a State Exchange. That is gobbledygook. You know, "such" must mean something different.   The word "such" means not -- not just the Exchange that the State was supposed to set up, but it means the State Exchange.   No. You -- you have to say it means the State Exchange. You have to -- your case hinges on the fact that a Federal Exchange is a State Exchange for purposes --   It met -- it met the requirements of the regulations you say, but do the regulations track the statute?   Do -- do they give the State authority to -- to say whether or not these -- these conditions have been met?
14-15 +++$+++    When you say it's clear -- it's clear to exclude a 1983 claim, but it's not clear to exclude the claim that you're bringing --   -- why is that?   Excuse me. Are you asking us to send this back to the agency?   Well --   But you don't want us to send it back to the Federal agency so they can tell us whether you're right or wrong about the number?   They approved the methodology. They didn't approve the number. That's what you're challenging here, not the methodology. You agree with the methodology. You can't at one and same -- at the same time agree that this is a primary jurisdiction case and yet not ask to send it back to, to the Federal agency.   Which is it?   I see. It's too late for that now.   HHS has not said $80. It has said the methodology. If you think $80 is not in accord with the methodology, according to Justice Breyer you should send it back to the Federal agency --   -- under primary jurisdiction but you didn't ask for that and you still don't ask for it.   If I understand your position, it is that the Federal Government could create a system in which it's for the Federal agency to decide whether the State has complied or not. It can do that. It just has not done so expressly here, right?   And you say it cannot do so impliedly. !   I think they're -- they're asserting that under our standard there -- there is no private right of action unless it is created by the Congress and we do not have implied rights of action. Now, you -- you want to create an implied right of action here. I -- I don't know why that isn't implicit in the scheme. Congress did not give a right to the providers. It -- it provided a remedy through the Federal agency.   That may well be, but it seems to me it's -- I am able to say that -- that when Congress wants the scheme that you desire, it creates a private cause of action. It has not created a private cause of action here and, therefore, it impliedly does not want the scheme that you desire.   Can CMS go into court as you say? I thought -- I thought what CMS can do is to -- is to simply refuse to fund the program.   Is that right? Do you know of any cases where that's what CMS does instead of -- instead of using the coercive power it has to simply cut off the funding? I thought that was its only remedy.   It's had that power but never used it.
14-86 +++$+++    You were about to tell us what the EEOC's theory of the case was. I was eager to hear that. Could you tell us what you think their theory of the case was?   I don't understand what you were about to say. Would you finish your thought?
