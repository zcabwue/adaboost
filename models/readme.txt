INSTRUCTIONS

To generate variables for predictions, run

    python scripts/scdb_copy.py

This uses the SCDB, found in data/SCDB_2015_01_caseCentered_Citation_trimmed.csv as well as transcripts of all Supreme Court oral arguments 2005-2014, provided by Courtcast and located in data/questions, to prepare a CSV file containing all variables needed for model generation, found in data/feature_table.csv.

To make predictions, run:

    python scripts/run_model_boost.py
    
To replicate Figure 1 from the paper, run:

    python scripts/run_all_models.py

Producing the python results takes less than 5 hours on a Windows 10 laptop with 2.8Ghz 4 core processor and 12 Gb of RAM.

Table 1 is not generated in code, and is simply a presentation of numbers from previous work.

To replicate Table 2, the decision margin comparison table, and Figure 1, the interaction plot, from the main text, run "court_prediction_replication.R".

To replicate Table 3, the prediction exercise results from the paper, run "predictions.R" -- this code takes less than 2 hours on a Windows 10 laptop with 16 Gb of RAM and a 2.8Ghz, 8 core processor. 

Appendix Figure 1, the petitioner-always-wins baseline plot, is generated by estimate_baseline.R.

Appendix Figure 2, the accuracy over time plot, is generated by prediction_over_time.R. Its hard-coded data is drawn from Table 2 in the main text.

Appendix Figure 3, the example decision tree, may be generated by the python script "print_decision_trees.py"

Appendix Tables 1 and 2, presenting the same data but in different orders, are generated by uncommenting Line 134 of the python script run_model_boost.py. 

NOTES
Some users have reported errors in "predictions.R" relating to the LASSO code, likely due to package namespace collisions.
